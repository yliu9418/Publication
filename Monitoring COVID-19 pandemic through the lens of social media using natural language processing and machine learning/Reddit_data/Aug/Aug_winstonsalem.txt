Any car dealerships out there taking coronavirus seriously?

Dude we have the internet now... the last 2 cars I bought were all done over email and text with the salesman and the finance guy. I spent literally 20 min at the dealer signing paperwork and thatâ€™s it. You can easily find out exactly what they paid for the truck and what the going rate in the market is with some research.
My mom bought a car from carvana...literally never left the house for it. Was delivered to her house, where she test rode it. Decided it was for her and got to keep it.
I went to CUABS for my free oil change where I bought my car last year. No one was wearing masks. I just waited outside and wore mine
Name the place and when you went. Car dealerships are scummy middlemen monopolies and it doesn't surprise me at all that some wouldn't take it seriously but I would also think they would cater to clientele of older people with money who would like to use their vehicle for more than a few days before dying.
