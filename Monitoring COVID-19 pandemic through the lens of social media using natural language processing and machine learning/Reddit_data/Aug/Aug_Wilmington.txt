Covid-19 in U.S. - 15 States with more Cases from 1 March to 2 August

I never understand the point of comparisons without adjusting for population http://91-divoc.com/pages/covid-visualization/?chart=states-normalized&highlight=North%20Carolina&show=us-states&y=both&scale=linear&data=cases-daily-7&data-source=jhu&xaxis=right&extra=New%20York#states-normalized

UNCW identifies two Covid-19 clusters

This article appears to be slightly out of day, according to UNCW's COVID-19 [data dashboard](https://uncw.edu/bestnest/datadashboard.html), they have identified 20 additional cases since Thursday üò¨
I have a family member who is a provider in town. They said that the majority of people they‚Äôve been testing have been college age kids who just will not accept the fact that they can‚Äôt have parties/friends over/general large groups of people.
I thought this was supposed to happen. The colleges charge full admission then wait for people to get sick and close after everyone has paid for everything with no reimbursements in mind. Wasn't there a big to do about that with some other major colleges?
Seems to apply more globally  "UNC-Chapel Hill made the decision to cancel all in-person classes after over a hundred students and faculty tested positive for Covid-19. The university was one of the largest in the nation planning a return to in-class instruction during the pandemic, a decision that was widely criticized, including a searing editorial by the Daily Tarheel which called the plan to reopen a ‚Äò**clusterfuck**.‚Äô"  https://www.dailytarheel.com/article/2020/08/covid-clusters-edit-0816
Does anyone know if the New Hanover dashboard includes UNCW cases?
I work at UNCW and the current talk around the staff is that we might me shutting down again by Thanksgiving.
From monitoring the UNCW dashboard:      Cumulative Positive Cases To Date - Since July 2020   **70** on Friday 8/28   **104** on Monday 8/31   **120** today 9/2   For **50** new cases on campus over a 5 day period.    Percentage of beds in use:	 	29%   Total number of beds currently in use:	 	44   Total number of beds reserved for quarantine /isolation:	 	150      Closure is going to happen, and I imagine not long from now. And with NHC showing 103 new cases yesterday (thanks /u/gidget1337) let's by all means move to Phase 2.5. Things are just going swimmingly so far!
Just got an email about another cluster of cases. That makes 3!
Anyone know the timeframe for the campus shutdown? I can‚Äôt imagine we will last anymore than a few weeks..
Yeah my wife got a text probably 1.5 weeks ago about this. The most recent article says there's another cluster. That was probably last night.
There‚Äôs basically a head shop with beer on Wrightsville rd, buffaloes or something. I went in there for some beer and there was 20+ people mostly college kids playing pool and hanging out in a very small area, no one had a mask not even the workers. It‚Äôs crazy
It‚Äôs college. Have you seen these dorms? When I was there it would be 3-6 kids per bedroom.... idk if that‚Äôs changed but even 2 per bedroom will still have a connecting bathroom to at least 2 more. Now that‚Äôs 4 strangers living together and sharing a bathroom and traveling to other large groups of students everyday for anything college related.   The parties are irrelevant at this point. They‚Äôre going to share a lot of space
The students and parents were warned up-front that this was a possibility and there would be no refunds on tuition (on campus housing and meal plans are refunded). I know several would-be freshmen that have deferred a year or are taking online community college classes, smart decision.  What really sucks is that now they are sending possibly infected kids back to their communities.
This is my question too, especially since the NHC dashboard shows 103 new cases yesterday (new daily high).
Huh? The in person semester has been scheduled to end at thanksgiving since they announced plans to reopen anyways
I was looking on the Snapchat map, and happened to see a snap from someone at 22 north earlier in the week. It was jam packed with people, no masks.   I‚Äôm not saying the stupidity is limited to college students. But people need to realize that we need to make some adjustments to help stop this thing.
Yeah the dorms are kid living together. The whole thing is stupid, they shouldn‚Äôt be on campus. However, the parties are the perfect place for super spreaders. That‚Äôs the big issue.
I don't know if that makes the parties  *irrelevant." They've said that bars are extremely prone to spread. Parties are probably just the same.
No other option but to send them home at that point
I'm aware, but it seems that a shutdown might happen again, by that time or before it. Doesn't help that there have already been 2 covid clusters reported since reopening.
Yeah, but my point is that the dorms are already super spreaders.
Yeah, I‚Äôm all for shutting down ASAP and really think it will happen before thanksgiving at this rate, especially with chapel hill having already ended in person.  I was confused by the ‚Äúcurrent talk around staff‚Äù being what was already confirmed by the school over a month ago  No offense or anything, I‚Äôm just desperate for some new information
It's all good. I shared because I knew this wasn't getting to the larger population. People deserve to know.
