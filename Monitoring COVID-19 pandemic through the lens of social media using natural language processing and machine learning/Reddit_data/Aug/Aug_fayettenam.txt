Do you think most, if not all, Americans will eventually catch coronavirus?
Do you think most, if not all, Americans will eventually catch coronavirus? ----Just trying to get a feel of how many people in this subreddit believe it's too late to stamp this virus out of existence, or develop a cure or vaccine before it spreads thru the rest of the population. ----|Vote Button| Poll Options|Current Vote Count||:-----------:|:------------:|:------------||**[Vote](http://redditpoll.com/vote/Vxb6F3V0z)**|Yes|**8** Votes |**[Vote](http://redditpoll.com/vote/KoWNhXQEj)**|No|**4** Votes ----**Instructions:*** Click Vote to Register Your Vote.----**Note:** Vote Count in this post will be updated real time with new data.----Make Your Own Poll Here **[redditpoll.com](http://redditpoll.com)**.----See live vote count **[here](http://redditpoll.com/poll/do-you-think-most-if-not-all-americans-will-eventually-catch-coronavirus)**
I genuinely believe most people will catch it. At this point it's far too late. The CDC predicts 200k deaths by the end of the week. When we have states getting 1,000+ added positive cases A DAY, it is too late. There was a time when we could have put this fire out... but we failed. I always had confidence in america being the worlds best country, the smartest, fastest, strongest. But We all dropped the ball. We have far too many idiots believing cell phone towers make us sick or that masks make you sick to ever be able snuff this out. I wish I didnt feel this way.. and it genuinely has zero to do with any race bc it couldve been america that started this and I would say the same about us. But I have such a bitterness for chinas government. They unleashed a monster on this world and act like they've done no wrong.. get offended if anyone calls them out for this shit. Not only are hundreds of thousands of people dead but every one of our lives is changed. Millions have no job bc of this, people can't pay their Bill's, health care staff is over worked, people are afraid, its divided us into "maskers " and "non maskers", we can't live normally. It's so fucked up how they knew full well about this virus and lied for weeks about it allowing their citizens to travel to other countries. Idk...   I'm just ranting now but my point is I dont believe we will ever go back to normal. This is our new normal. A vaccine will help for sure and there is one that is promising right now but so many people believe they will be chipped if they get a vaccine, as if the government really gives that much of a shit about their dumb ass and if they go to McDonald's after work, tracking their every move. Its pathetic. The avg American is extremely stupid, I've found that out real quick.
It's a done deal bud

Coronavirus Exposure
A waitress at Bubba‚Äôs 33 tested positive a few days ago for coronavirus. She worked the day her symptoms started! And the days before. If anyone ate there you should probably get tested!!!!
Bubba's 33
You know this how??
I don‚Äôt know how anyone feels safe eating in a restaurant right now
You mean bubbas 33 in Fayetteville?  You know who it was, because my whole party was there Saturday night and now we‚Äôre all positive ü§¨
Yes
I know her personally.
Some of us don't live in fear. If dumb ass people would stay home instead of coming to work sick, none of this would be a issue.
That‚Äôs the risk you take, when you choose to go out, in a pandemic. You can‚Äôt be mad at her for working without knowing she was infected. Sounds like she started to feel sick so she went and got tested. I highly doubt she intentionally worked knowing she was sick.
You play with fire and will get burned eventually.
Her symptoms started Monday.
Sounds like she infected yall with it. Somebody ought to lay her over there knee and spank that hide like she was a red headed stepchild that colored all over the walls with a crayon.
What part of people being contagious BEFORE feeling sick is so very difficult to understand? Also, servers missing shifts can‚Äôt pay their bills. So a lot of them work sick because there is no such thing as paid sick leave when you‚Äôre a server.
First and foremost, there‚Äôs guidelines.  We were at a distanced table with our masks.  If we do all we‚Äôre suppose to and people who have any form of symptoms go or stay home we‚Äôd be fine.  Nice try tho
You might wanna say that to yourself.
Maybe Sunday night.
That is a very idiotic statement. People who are working at restaurants obviously did not get unemployment and being a waitress right now isnt really worth much during the pandemic. You have to make money to survive and if the company involved isnt atleast doing a screening everyday asking questions taking temperatures its there fault. Get over eating in restaurants period its a bad idea with a fucking plague going on.
Exactly, she was on unemployment but obviously that ran out. She had no choice.
Not at all. There‚Äôs an incubation period. People can be contagious for days before they get symptoms. That‚Äôs a risk you take. The governor caved to peer pressure and opened things up while numbers were still rising. Every other country, that has successfully dealt with Covid, didn‚Äôt open dining until well after the numbers had dropped. Americans wanted to whine and bitch about their social lives and their rights to go out.. and this is what happens. Waitresses are touching your food, your plates, your silverware, your glasses. They‚Äôre not washing there hands every time they touch something and their not changing gloves between tables. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
I don‚Äôt eat out in a pandemic. Especially with a whole party.
Well that sounds like a personal problem to me. Listen, this don't got nothing to do with just corona, even if u got a regular cold or flu you need to stay your butt home and not get other people sick. Restaurants need to stay open, people still got to eat and businesses still got to make money. If this waitress burned up all her sick days already, or the company don't offer none, then that's a personal problem in my book for not managing there money more wisely so they could afford time off, or finding a better career than waiting tables. These jobs are meant for high schoolers, college students and ppl just getting into the workplace anyhow. Soon, these kind of jobs will be done by robots, that don't spread disease or go on strike for $15 that they don't deserve, which is the way it ought to be. We just might have to agree to disagree on this one /u/suprementyo because you just don't get it.
Well then, I got a tip for you... In that case , they ought to save there tips so they can afford to take a sick day. Or ditch the college kid job and find a real career that offers PTO. As I said, once we get rid of these kind of jobs and give them to the robots, mankind will be better off. Everybody hates working them jobs anyway, and it will lower prices for consumers due to less overhead for the owners of the company's.
Me and you's just going to have to agree to disagree on this one. Because not only are we not on the same page, but reading two totally different books.
