TGIF! K-12 School Week Re-Cap (during COVID-19)
I want to do something called TGIF! K-12 School Week Re-Cap\*\*\*Goal: An open invite for one long thread to capture all the change in 2020-2021 school year that occurred. Society is returning to (the obvious) conversations about children who die from COVID. I'm sure there are NC stories in local papers.Lots of hyperlinks!If we don't document capture information and talk about: (1) the weekly stories, and (2) our collective thoughts - there is NO WAY to figure out how to find "the best practices" (if such practices exist).\*\*\*And - Please feel free to take the opportunity to talk about what needs to happen locally. The good, the bad, and the ugly. I really want to "open the door" for teachers, substitute teachers, health aids, school staff, childcare, etc. to let us know:How are preparations? Did the school REALLY give you mental health? How's is sitting at desks during school lunch going? Do you have a school nurse?Does Your School Need Anything To Protect Your Health? \[BE HONEST, with the community. People are HERE.\]I welcome a forecast (no pressure, when you're ready): What do you think the school outlook is going to be? Will teachers/school personnel have a mental health crisis or strike or have the fortitude to work with "Plan B" (or whatever choice program)? Are there immediate recommendations to help make things better?\*\*\*Note: We have next week's TGIF! K-12 School Week Re-Cap. There's no pressure to ever answer now. Just know: there's a on-line community of 2,400 North Carolinians.Hope this might be helpful. 
A North Carolina private school reopened amid national concerns over in-person classes. Days later a staff member tested positive for coronavirus.  https://www.businessinsider.com/nc-private-school-reports-coronavirus-case-days-after-reopening-2020-7
I’m working for a middle school that is keeping our kids safe and keeping our teacher safe. I mean it’s part of WCPSS so its public. After reading everything I have read, I’m so grateful. It really seems like despite coming together in the last second, they’ve given me the tools I need to be successful for students in the virtual Academy. I can only speak from a teacher’s perspective but I’m one of the lucky ones working in a protected school. Going back to school in person… Absolute nightmare..￼
My 2 kids are going to private school in person. They are in middle and upper school. My middle schooler had a horrible online experience. He really needs to learn in person. He failed 3 classes online.
The third largest district in the state is remote until October 20th. The district originally told teachers they could conduct remote instruction from their homes, but buildings would also be accessible (with proper precautions) if needed for technology use.   The district lied. It is now requiring teachers to return to the buildings to do remote instruction. The only way a teacher can be exempt from this is for his/her principal to “work with them,” but that is terribly inconsistent across the district. Some principles are rubber stamping all requests to work remotely from home, and others are requiring a doctors note about a health condition.
My 6yo daughter’s private school is offering in-person, hybrid or virtual learning atm. We’re currently opting for in person bc there’s 8 kids in her class and she’s done very well with understanding why masks, hand washing and distance are so important. Hey school has what my husband and I consider to be a very thorough reopening plan, and my kids misses other kids so much I really want her to get whatever socializing is possible right now.   Things may change, and I feel like we’ll continue to make informed decisions about what’s safest, but I’m really glad in person is a safe option for our child.
Thank you for sharing.
The state said they will offer teachers mental health services. Please confirm.   The state said there is a PPE plan. Please confirm you have supplies.
I’m glad your daughter is in a small class! You know they can probably manage the safety precautions way way easier as a result of having small class sizes. I do have hope for in person teaching in small schools that take the right steps!
FWIW, i’m fairly certain that they are going to reopen on a quarterly basis. For example, they gave us a schedule that went to October 22, and then The district released a statement about the school being remote until October 22. Chances are they will make the decision about Second quarter in late September, and if we still don’t reopen, it will probably be after winter break or closer to the start of quarter three, at the end of January. This is what I believe to be happening, as a teacher, because they have to plan on some kind of a chunked time basis so for what it’s worth, that’s what I think parents can rely on lightly.

Goodness, it looks like they are taking ownership of a mistake. Isn’t that what we would want to see if a mistake was made? If they were trying to cover it up, or make the “percentages look nice and pretty”, I doubt they would go public and correct the data. I’m honestly perplexed, what would you rather they do in this situation?
> It did not impact the case count total or the percent positive calculation that NCDHHS reports.  How does this not affect the percent positive calculation?  Isn’t that just positive tests divided by total tests?   How can you change the denominator by 200,000 and the ratio isn’t affected?  I guess it’s possible if the 200,000 out-of-state tests had exactly the same percent positive rate as all of the in-state testing.  But that seems like a rather suspicious coincidence.
Not a good look, Cooper.
Ahh yes, over reporting testing to make the percentages look nice and pretty...we are so screwed.  Cooper has handed the senate and the Governors mansion to the republicans on a gold platter, it's all over but the crying if every dem in the state doesn't vote straight ticket.
Have the State been send the For-Profit Company checks? When did the State get the bright idea that it's time to Audit?  Don't be fooled by Mandy's credentials. I'm from DC and I'm not impressed. It's not gender, it's listening skills.
Well, obviously Cooper is an amateur if he doesn't know how to effectively blame it on the Republicans.  /s because 2020
Yes, I’ve been really impressed with Cooper during this
NC has 5,300,000 cases so the 200,000 errors is insignificant.  It happened over a long period of time so it didn't jack up a particular day or week.  Given the number of false positives (and negatives), along with the difficulty of being tested, the "number of cases" stat is pretty much useless.  The hospitalization and [death rate](https://coronavirus.1point3acres.com/en) is far more indicative of the severity of the virus, but both of them are trailing indicators.
Being transparent about mistakes that happen (in this case by labcorp)?  How is this bad?
Come on..... say it. You called it. :-)
>I'm from DC  ... now we know to not give you anything sharp to play with.  ;)
Ah, knew I was missing something! Ha!
Bullshit, ~4% is beyond "a margin of insignificant error". That's 200k tests that I want to know the answer to. Were they positive or not? What percentage?  How did this error happen? That's not just a handful that were mistakes. This smells.

COVID-19 rapid test question
Before I can fly internationally to see my family I have to have a negative COVID-19 RT-PCR test result within 72 hours of departure. I have finally found a place that does rapid test but can’t seem to find clarification on whether rapid tests could be considered RT-PCR test. If anyone has any information on this please let me know

Don't forget to call 811 before you dig.
Well timed!  Thanks!
Dude I don't know who you are but I know you!   CCG in creedmoor maybe??! I putter at potting, and spend a fair bit of time there.  I'm not sure where but we've met on more than one occasion.
Thanks!  That's great advice.  I'll add that!
Enjoy and stay safe!
hmmm...  maybe.  I did pass by there on my way to Naple/Miami Florida a while ago.  You're talking about the gallery not too far from 95 right?  If so, you have an incredible memory.
Sounds likely! Small world, love your work, I'll be stuck looking at the website all day lol!
I apologize, but your @handle isn't jogging my memory.  Are you a fellow artist?  Have a website?  Love to see your work.
I am a potter occasionally, though my back isn't really ok with that anymore. I'm not that remarkable as far as looks go imo...I just knew your name and face as soon as I saw it and couldn't place it.  I had a site and imgur but let it go over the last few months as my back is telling me my wheel days are likely behind me and summer heat prevents me from firing anything for at least a few more months but I'll send you a pm.
Ergonomics is tough for us artists.  I sit at my easel too much as well.  Finally decided to get a better chair.  I purposefully have to wander around the studio/yard to stretch, and do some core exercises.  My neighbor is a potter.  She's set up a pretty nice operation in her garage.  Good pads on the floor for her feet.  Some equipment for both sitting and standing.  Maybe your wheel days aren't behind you, just need a different set up?  Look forward to seeing your PM.

We currently live in Wilmington. We are spending 30 days just outside of Boone to hike this fall. We have a long term rental set up. Same social distancing. Essentially we’re trading one grocery store for another. Trading the beach for the mountains.   We are all stoked.
Very jealous.  We had a somewhat similar plan that was cancelled.  The owners decided they wanted to stay in their wilderness cabin during a pandemic rather than rent it out.  Don't blame them.    Have fun on your social distancing adventure.  Don't forget to take pics and share.  Stay safe!

For those saying “duh”... will you say the same when their education suffers?  “Who would have thought remote learning doesn’t give the same experience and understanding that in-person does?”
Remote learning for general education and electives can be the same as in person.   The only time where students will suffer is during the science labs.   It’s usually the professors talking anyways
You're assuming that everyone's home environment is free of distractions and at-home issues. And that they have consistent broadband internet, etc.  I still believe there is a psychological/sociological/haptic aspect of in-person education that cannot be emulated fully in a virtual environment.
