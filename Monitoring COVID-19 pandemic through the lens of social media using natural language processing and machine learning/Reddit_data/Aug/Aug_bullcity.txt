Durham Co. COVID-19 Case Count Update for Jul 31 (-6%)

This also marks the first time in ages that the estimated active cases is under 500! (5789 confirmed cases total, 5292 released from isolation)
Yesterday's report for Durham Co. included 70 new cases and 0 deaths. Over the past 2 weeks, we have averaged 63 new cases per day.  For some additional context, in the prior 2-week period, the state-level positive rate was 8.5%; over the past two weeks, it was 7.4%. Taking the wider view (past 2 months), the state-wide positive rate was 7.8%.  Should we keep at our current rate of growth (-6%), on Aug 15, we would expect to have seen 838 new cases since today (59 per day, a decrease of 3 per day compared to the current period).
My best friend lives in LA and they’re just absolutely miserable over there right now. I really appreciate and am grateful for how “low” the triangle is.

Durham Co. COVID-19 Case Count Update for Aug 1 (-9%)

Yesterday's report for Durham Co. included 57 new cases and 1 death. Over the past 2 weeks, we have averaged 63 new cases per day.  For some additional context, in the prior 2-week period, the state-level positive rate was 8.7%; over the past two weeks, it was 7.2%. Taking the wider view (past 2 months), the state-wide positive rate was 7.8%.  Should we keep at our current rate of growth (-9%), on Aug 16, we would expect to have seen 804 new cases since today (57 per day, a decrease of 5 per day compared to the current period).
Hope we continue on this trend!
I continue to feel as if I am missing something.  Why do you feel the derivative is a useful descriptor of the data?  What matters the most is the number of hospitalizations and deaths.  To the extent that the number of cases is predictive of those two other metrics (and of human distress,  long term health impacts, burden on the healthcare system, economic harm, other human and economic costs, etc.), the number of cases is also important. The rate of change seems rather tertiary.  Also, if you would please label your axes, that would help people interpret the graph, since most people would look at that and think that the number of cases (not the rate of change) is what is being shown.  Your x is time (yes?) and your Y is... the first derivative (?).  The title "case counts" isn't right either, it's the rate of change in the number of case counts over time (?).
Thanks for the note. Always nice to hear from people with suggestions and feedback on the graphic.  I share your general frustration that there is no clear AND available metric for telling the story of the local outbreak. Deaths is difficult because it obscures very serious hospitalizations that are survived. Hospitalizations is tough because while the human toll shouldn't be overlooked, what the general public cares about is hospital utilization (i.e. are we close to an NYC situation) and that information is not available publicly.    I have focused on the rate of change because my goal with this, from the beginning, has been to try and describe whether the situation is deteriorating, stable, or improving. The rate of change is the numeric representation of that fact. Put another way,  if the rate of change is negative then if we continue doing exactly what we are doing, the case counts should drop. Conversely, if the rate is positive, then what we are currently doing is going to lead to exponential growth in cases.  This is the best way that I could think of for an individual to digest these numbers and modify their behavior as needed.  While I do show the total number of new cases in the most recent period, my worry with this numbers ( or the raw number of hospitalizations or deaths ) is that, at least for me, they are hard to put in context.  As a result, it's hard to evaluate my options based on those numbers alone. Hence including the rate of change as a 2nd key focus metric.  Thanks again for reaching out. I'm very glad to see how engaged Durhamites are with this situation.
why did you remove the "new case counts" title? I had the same comment as /u/Eggemoggin a few days ago and I seem to recall you had changed the title. I also think seeing "Case counts" and "900" is misleading. if you want to keep "case counts" then at least show the total case count, which as of right now is 5914 and must have been around 5100 two weeks ago
Oops. Inadvertent. Not sure how it got changed back. It should be back to "New Case Counts" today.

Durham Co. COVID-19 Case Count Update for Aug 2 (-11%)

Thank you for doing these. I never comment but I read them every day.
Day to day, numbers like these don't mean much due to noise resulting from small n. But this is like a solid week of downward numbers -- definitely encouraging.
Yesterday's report for Durham Co. included 44 new cases and 1 death. Over the past 2 weeks, we have averaged 61 new cases per day.  For some additional context, in the prior 2-week period, the state-level positive rate was 8.9%; over the past two weeks, it was 6.9%. Taking the wider view (past 2 months), the state-wide positive rate was 7.8%.  Should we keep at our current rate of growth (-11%), on Aug 17, we would expect to have seen 767 new cases since today (54 per day, a decrease of 6 per day compared to the current period).
Thanks for reaching out. Always glad to hear that people are finding this information useful.
And it's "corroborated" to some extent by the state-wide testing rate too. Down 2 full percentage points in the past two weeks. First time the 14-day average has been below 7% in some time.  Keep it up people!
I'm still having trouble interpreting the positive test rate stat... it gets touted as very important, but seems highly confounded by selection bias. Can you explain the interpretation to me?
My understanding is that it assumes that the selection bias at play is pretty consistent over time. If you assume that the people most likely to think they are exposed are always the ones that are most likely to get tested, then the selection bias is still present, but it's not changing.  That means that while the actual positive rate is not necessarily meaningful (i.e. it is way higher than the actual % of the pop with COVID), the change is meaningful.   So 6.9% by itself isn't good or bad, but a change from 8.9% to 6.9% is good news because it means that of the people "most likely to think they are exposed", fewer actually have the disease. If the local spread of the disease were accelerating, it's unlikely that this would be true.

Durham Co. COVID-19 Case Count Update for Aug 3 (-13%)

I feel like we are finally making some progress
Yesterday's report for Durham Co. included 43 new cases and 0 deaths. Over the past 2 weeks, we have averaged 60 new cases per day.  For some additional context, in the prior 2-week period, the state-level positive rate was 8.4%; over the past two weeks, it was 7.0%. Taking the wider view (past 2 months), the state-wide positive rate was 7.8%.  Should we keep at our current rate of growth (-13%), on Aug 18, we would expect to have seen 732 new cases since today (52 per day, a decrease of 8 per day compared to the current period).
Is there any concern about the accuracy of these numbers? Does the data go through any federal department before appearing on the Durham County or NCDHHS website?
No, all data in North Carolina is reported directly to County Health departments and the state DHHS. Additionally, the federal HHS department is only involved in collection hospitalization and hospital capacity statistics. In NC, these are reported separately to the state DHHS and to the HHS Protect system.
> Does the data go through any federal department before appearing on the Durham County or NCDHHS website?  https://durhampublichealth-durhamnc.hub.arcgis.com/  >Case Data is updated once daily; >Source: Durham County Public Health  don't know if that answers your question  edit: The data is straight from the horse's mouth and not from Federal Gov. It wouldn't make sense from an IT standpoint, to send data to DC, and send it back to be locally hosted, and all it work in real time on the same day.

Durham Co. COVID-19 Case Count Update for Aug 4 (-24%) ***SEE NOTE

Note: the state reported an extremely low number of tests yesterday, possibly an after-effect of the hurricane. This is likely a cause of the very low reported case count yesterday.  Yesterday's report for Durham Co. included 28 new cases and 0 deaths. Over the past 2 weeks, we have averaged 56 new cases per day.  For some additional context, in the prior 2-week period, the state-level positive rate was 8.4%; over the past two weeks, it was 7.2%. Taking the wider view (past 2 months), the state-wide positive rate was 7.8%.  Should we keep at our current rate of growth (-24%), on Aug 19, we would expect to have seen 597 new cases since today (42 per day, a decrease of 13 per day compared to the current period).
Not only the hurricane, but also the small spike 2 weeks after July 4th that inflated the number from 2 weeks ago.
Do we know how many people are getting tested daily in Durham? Are there lots of centers or just a couple?  Are more people going in bc they have symptoms or iust getting tested because?
Very interesting. I was waiting for today to see if there was the usual "Tuesday reporting dump" that you recognized as a possibility earlier. Tomorrow and Friday will be very interesting to see now.  Thanks as always.
I don't know if there's even a place where you can get tested without symptoms. A couple weeks ago I tried to get a test but inquiries at Walgreens, CVS, Passport Health, and Duke all failed. I'm a healthy person but I wanted a negative test before going to visit family. Everyone said that test supplies were so limited that they weren't available for the general population.   If anyone does know a place, please let me know!
It's not exactly the ideal way to read the information, but the [NC DHHS Dashboard](https://covid19.ncdhhs.gov/dashboard/testing) has a county by county map on the testing page that has a not-easy-to-read bar graph where you can estimate the number of tests for Durham County. It looks like it's averaged around 600-700 per day for the past few weeks.
> iust getting tested because?  a lot of places are requiring it for work now
My wife and I both got tested as a precaution before and after traveling at CVS. We didn’t have symptoms but just said we did when scheduling the appointment online. At the one on Hillsborough you literally just go through the drive thru.
Try Avance Care. As a precaution, I've gotten tested twice there now without symptoms.
If you donate blood with Blood Connection, they're doing an antibody test for free with your donation.
>I don't know if there's even a place where you can get tested without symptoms  You just need to claim you have them. Not endorsing that, but people are doing that shit left and right.   Meanwhile, people who actually have symptoms end up waiting a week for results not knowing because of backlogs...
I wonder if this is a new shortage? A month ago my housemate got a test without symptoms before he went home to visit his mom.
I got tested at CVS on MLK last week. Needed it to travel for work. I did not say I was experiencing symptoms, and was able to get it the next day. Results came back in 2 days.
My daughter needed a test before moving into her college dorm and I was able to schedule both of us at the Walgreens on Guess Rd.  No symptoms, no exposure, no risk factors.
>We didn’t have symptoms but just said we did  Yep - this is how you get tested if you're just curious or otherwise feeling fine. You lie about having symptoms.  Now - whether or not you feel like that's ethical given your situation is another call. But you'll get a test. Arguably, this happening en masse is also a reason tests are as hard to get as they are (aside from complete federal incompetency).
How much did they charge and what was the process like? I've been thinking of getting tested there to avoid the **8** day wait one of my coworkers had at CVS.
Thank you for this idea! I usually donate at the Red Cross so I booked myself a donation appt for this weekend. They are also doing antibody testing.
The first time I went (in April I think?) it was free, but the last time it was a $45 copay, which they said was to ensure that insurance would cover it entirely.  I made an appointment through their website and booked a time slot (there were plenty available). The Durham location off MLK has a drive through testing site in the back. Was easy and got my results 3-4 days later.

Durham Co. COVID-19 Case Count Update for Aug 5 (-24%)

The NCDHHS has added a notice to their cases page that says "we identified laboratory reporting omissions from 8/2-8/5 (edited to fix month).  corrected data will be posted today" (presumably, about 90 minutes from the time I post this).    Will those omissions affect the Durham numbers as well?  Do you or anyone else in the community know more about this?  https://covid19.ncdhhs.gov/dashboard#cases-over-time
In general, NC is following the trajectory of other states (hotspots) that have had falling cases (Like Arizona, South Carolina) within the past couple of weeks:  [See this WaPost tracker](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/national/coronavirus-us-cases-deaths/?hpid=hp_hp-top-table-main_gfx-virus-tracker%3Ahomepage%2Fstory-ans&itid=hp_hp-top-table-main_gfx-virus-tracker%3Ahomepage%2Fstory-ans)  I don't think this is whoever juicing the numbers or whathaveyou
Yesterday's report for Durham Co. included 42 new cases and 0 deaths. Over the past 2 weeks, we have averaged 55 new cases per day.  For some additional context, in the prior 2-week period, the state-level positive rate was 8.3%; over the past two weeks, it was 7.2%. Taking the wider view (past 2 months), the state-wide positive rate was 7.8%.  Should we keep at our current rate of growth (-24%), on Aug 20, we would expect to have seen 588 new cases since today (42 per day, a decrease of 13 per day compared to the current period).
We should be in Phase 3 and just let the people decide if they want to go out or open their businesses or not
Hard to say for sure. All the numbers in the graphic, including the line chart, are pulled from the Durham site, so this would only be a factor if the NC issues were related to Durham in some way.  Regardless, since the issue is over 4 weeks old, it doesn't affect our current growth rate.
So this still incorporates the big drop in testing due to the hurricane, right?
No.  It's great our cases are declining - if they even actually are - as OP noted the storm may have affected reporting. If they are going down, they are still *not* occurring at a low rate. This is just less bad, basically. Until there is competent contact tracing, responsive and accessible testing AND a low rate of cases no place is actually ready to be reopened in a Phase 3 manner under sane guidelines.  This means getting under control - IE you know who has the cases and where they are and who they've been in contact with and there's not just random community spread happening. We're seemingly a long way from that.
My bad, that is 8/2 - 8/5 or this week.  I'll edit it.
That's correct.
the original intent was to flatten the curve so hospitals  can manage the incoming covid patients. I think our hospitals are not having any problems handling this, It was never about having 0 cases. Contact tracing only works if theres 2 or 3 cases because its easier to track down. We have about a thousand cases right now.
Thanks. I will go back and check the Durham numbers from 8/2 through 8/5 later today to see if they need to be changed in my DB.
Flattening the curve was about reducing unnecessary deaths, which was an immediate danger, still came to pass in many places. That was sort of the last solution after this was already out of control. A hospital not being overwhelmed is not the benchmark for things being otherwise okay.   I don't think adequate hospital capacity was ever a serious benchmark for having everything be open, at least via most public health folks. The goal has always still been to get it under control - which means knowing where it's at and being able to respond quickly if it jumps around (this is where adequate testing is necessary).   You're exaggerating the capacity of contact tracing but in spirit you're right, yea - you need lower caseloads for it to be effective - which is why we need to keep staying closed and keep hopefully driving cases down to where we can know where it's at. And then when we know where it's at and can keep up then phase 3 doesn't seem so stupid.
> A hospital not being overwhelmed is not the benchmark for things being otherwise okay.  It was a serious concern though in March, when these lockdowns were initially proposed and implemented. That's how the lockdowns were "sold" in other words:  https://www.northcarolinahealthnews.org/2020/03/26/covid-19-icu-beds/  >Another mathematical model created by economists, statisticians and engineers in Silicon Valley predict that if North Carolina does not enact more stringent measures to restrict the transmission of coronavirus, sometime in early April, hospitals could be overwhelmed by about two or three times more patients than there are beds.  https://www.northcarolinahealthnews.org/2020/06/18/amidst-covid-19-some-nc-hospitals-may-soon-run-out-of-room/  >As the pandemic spread across the state in March and April, some projections warned that a spike in hospitalizations could exceed the state’s capacity as early as in mid-April, but state health officials believe stay-at-home restrictions averted that early surge, giving hospital systems and the state two more months to prepare. Minimizing North Carolina’s initial wave of COVID-19 infections prevented a hospital bed shortage like the one New York City experienced in March and April.

Durham Co. COVID-19 Case Count Update for Aug 6 (-28%)

Keep social distancing, don’t let the numbers going down fool you into thinking it’s gone.
Yesterday's report for Durham Co. included 57 new cases and 0 deaths. Over the past 2 weeks, we have averaged 52 new cases per day.  For some additional context, in the prior 2-week period, the state-level positive rate was 8.0%; over the past two weeks, it was 7.2%. Taking the wider view (past 2 months), the state-wide positive rate was 7.8%.  Should we keep at our current rate of growth (-28%), on Aug 21, we would expect to have seen 529 new cases since today (37 per day, a decrease of 14 per day compared to the current period).
I'm curious to see what happens once the students are back for a few weeks.
Duke students moving in today, these numbers about to absolutely skyrocket.
Durham County also hit it's lowest 7 day average of new cases (45.57) since May 29th, 72 days ago!
Exactly. Growth isn't even flat untill -100%.
Any additional thoughts on the low reporting numbers from Tuesday now that Wed/Thurs numbers are in? It doesn't look as though we saw more data come in with higher numbers to "make up" for that lull.  Of course, I know you have access to the data, but can't, with certainty, determine the mechanisms behind it, but thought I'd check.
Certainly possible. But also not 100% certain.
Skyrocket? Nope. I can dig through this sub and find past predictions about when cases would go up, "skyrocket": Memorial Day, Floyd Protests, July 4th, and now this.  https://durhampublichealth-durhamnc.hub.arcgis.com/  A lot of people's assumptions and assertions about how this virus operates have been wrong, me included.   Now y'all are basically saying its gonna be students and parties driving up cases:  https://old.reddit.com/r/bullcity/comments/i4oef2/unc_students_concerned_after_video_surfaces_of/  -I disagree, the fundamentals of how community spread is happening here, haven't changed: People who work essential jobs (where masks might not be worn all the time) and live in large households, are getting most of the cases. These folks aren't (more than anyone else) partying all the time, going to dine-in restaurants, breweries, taprooms, gyms (that aren't supposed to be open) or whatever else y'all might be thinking that's driving all our cases.
Care to hazard a prediction? One month from today, Sep 9, what do you think our two week total of new cases will be (i.e. the right number in the graphic)?
Hurricane, probably.
Virginia is today adding 2,000 cases that were delayed in reporting from the last couple of days. [https://www.insidenova.com/news/special/coronavirus/more-than-2-000-covid-19-cases-added-in-virginia-after-reporting-delay/article\_a8797a92-d8ac-11ea-b046-a39ff624c48a.html](https://www.insidenova.com/news/special/coronavirus/more-than-2-000-covid-19-cases-added-in-virginia-after-reporting-delay/article_a8797a92-d8ac-11ea-b046-a39ff624c48a.html)  Wouldn't shock me if whatever delayed that data is also affecting ours.
Yeah, I checked the Durham site to see if the prior numbers changed, but they hadn't.
From the recent trends in the states, there's reason to believe that places that had effective lockdowns see bigger spikes once things ease up. I'm usually on the optimistic side, but I think we will indeed see a big spike in cases.  I hope someone is anticipating this and has contingency plans ready. My suspicion is there are not plans and we'll just go back to our bunkers again.  I'm sure I'll get push back, but an extended, controlled spread might be worth thinking about. Look at New York. Through all of the spiking, they were steady. Total conjecture on my part, but IMO worth noting.  Even with a vaccine, people will still get it. I don;t think we should bank on eradicating this with a vaccine many months from now.
And then add how many thousands on top of that who are going to be doing those things...
Care to hazard a prediction? One month from today, Sep 9, what do you think our two week total of new cases will be (i.e. the right number in the graphic)?
There absolutely is no plan whatsoever besides telling the students to go home at some point, probably.
I don't know about numbers, but I will predict that Durham will continue its downward trend in case counts and/or positive test rates.  We could see isolated local outbreaks, which the news will jump on, and people will make a lot of hay on in here.  We will continue to see more "blaming students" posts like this:  https://old.reddit.com/r/bullcity/comments/i6vma7/duke_students_already_congregating/
I'm pretty sure the plan is to bring students to campus to collect full tuition + board payments. Then send them home when students start withdrawing, professors and staff strike or refuse to work on campus, or they are forced to shut down by executive order or county health department. Then they won't give refunds due to "unforeseen circumstances beyond our control."    My personal plan is to avoid anywhere students congregate. Sorry Monuts :(
The "plan" is to make it appear that the (very predictable) behavior of the students is what is making in-person impossible. Despite it being obvious that in-person will absolutely drive infection higher, and an almost guarantee that students will ultimately be sent home.  This will make it easier on the schools to keep tuition and fees without refunds.

Durham Co. COVID-19 Case Count Update for Aug 8 (-32%)

Sorry for no post yesterday. The Friday case update didn't end up posted until last night.  Yesterday's report for Durham Co. included 32 new cases and 0 deaths. Over the past 2 weeks, we have averaged 49 new cases per day.  For some additional context, in the prior 2-week period, the state-level positive rate was 7.9%; over the past two weeks, it was 7.0%. Taking the wider view (past 2 months), the state-wide positive rate was 7.8%.  Should we keep at our current rate of growth (-32%), on Aug 23, we would expect to have seen 469 new cases since today (33 per day, a decrease of 15 per day compared to the current period).
Will be interesting to see Duke’s impact in a few weeks.  And what happens when people are inside bc of the weather
Keep going down..plsplsplsplspls
Thanks for continuing to post these!
I'm love seeing these downward trends. I really hope the college kids don't cause a spike again because I want to get back to the gym.
The Duke students who are living off campus are going to wreck these numbers.  What I have seen this weekend- they do not care about Durham,  Duke will let them take all classes online and yet most all of the Jrs and Srs are back in Durham.  West Village is aka “Frat Row” as per the maskless bros i had the pleasure of meeting yesterday
Care to hazard a prediction? One month from today, Sep 9, what do you think our two week total of new cases will be (i.e. the right number in the graphic)?
This is North Carolina. We've been inside because of the weather for the last several weeks. Once Fall hits everyone's going to be back outside until February. We'll be back to Spring levels of outdoor distancing again.

I don’t know where you’re from but if you think you’ll see more people outside in NC from Nov.-Feb. , than May-August you lost your damn mind.

Please help me get my PhD! Need Research Participants for Dissertation Study at NCSU due to COVID-19 halting in-person data collection. It's on digital communication!
Summary: Are you bored and looking for something to do during the quarantine? Participate in a research study on digital communication and help an NCSU grad student! :)Details: Hi Everyone! I hope you are all staying safe and sane during this quarantine! So COVID-19 meant I had to halt data collection for my dissertation research which compares different communication mediums (e.g., computer vs VR) in terms of communication, social presence, and feelings of connection. I am almost done with data collection and now only need male participants for the voice-only condition (conducted in Zoom). I've already finished recruiting female participants. If you have time to participate, I would greatly appreciate your help! For a full list of eligibility requirements and what the study entails, please see the recruitment flyer (link here: [https://drive.google.com/open?id=10q6cWy69N23DtUdC\_XI4ANYIm\_Cm8Eqg](https://drive.google.com/open?id=10q6cWy69N23DtUdC_XI4ANYIm_Cm8Eqg)).If I sparked your interest and you would like to sign up for the study, here is a link to the scheduler survey: [https://ncsu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\_d3RO8yx8WPdnaiF](https://ncsu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_d3RO8yx8WPdnaiF).Stay safe everybody!And thanks so much to those who have already signed up!Note: I've had a couple of people ask me about the 20/20 corrected or natural vision requirement so I'll go ahead and answer that question here. :) Basically, you can participate if you wear glasses or contacts, I just ask that you are wearing them during the study. If your vision doesn't correct totally to 20/20 but it's pretty close and you can still see everything pretty well, that is fine too.
Fellow NCSU student, would help but I have rather poor eyesight, but good luck!
Thanks so much for your interest though!

Durham Co. COVID-19 Case Count Update for Aug 9 (-28%)

I'm glad to see this downward trend, but is anyone else expecting another spike with Duke and schools reopening?
Yesterday's report for Durham Co. included 67 new cases and 0 deaths. Over the past 2 weeks, we have averaged 50 new cases per day.  For some additional context, in the prior 2-week period, the state-level positive rate was 7.6%; over the past two weeks, it was 7.2%. Taking the wider view (past 2 months), the state-wide positive rate was 7.8%.  Should we keep at our current rate of growth (-28%), on Aug 24, we would expect to have seen 509 new cases since today (36 per day, a decrease of 14 per day compared to the current period).
Yay! thats it! covids going away! woohoo!
I think I would be surprised if there is an outbreak that is clearly and unarguably centered on Duke. Just too many factors at play to be able to attribute anything to such a "relatively" small influence with any certainty.
Durham has a pretty good dashboard of statistics that you should check out. Although we're doing better compared to 2 weeks ago, we're only down to the levels that we saw in June and could easily go back up again. This only shows that we need to keep doing what we're doing.  https://durhampublichealth-durhamnc.hub.arcgis.com/
Are any local public schools going straight to in person classes, do you know?
Or NCCU. Kids are back there, too.
All DPS schools are fully online for at least the first 9 weeks.   https://www.newsobserver.com/news/local/education/article244269492.html
I am not sure.
I believe every county touching Durham is fully digital for at least the first 9 weeks. There are some smaller counties going back in person, but not a ton for sure.
That's good to hear.
and no sports for the first 9 weeks too
Also good news

Durham Co. COVID-19 Case Count Update for Aug 10 (-28%)

Yesterday's report for Durham Co. included 26 new cases and 0 deaths. Over the past 2 weeks, we have averaged 48 new cases per day.  For some additional context, in the prior 2-week period, the state-level positive rate was 7.6%; over the past two weeks, it was 7.1%. Taking the wider view (past 2 months), the state-wide positive rate was 7.8%.  Should we keep at our current rate of growth (-28%), on Aug 25, we would expect to have seen 488 new cases since today (34 per day, a decrease of 13 per day compared to the current period).
What changed that we are doing so much better?
Most likely, Durham's Latino population has reached herd immunity.  The June and July spikes weren't general across Durham's population, they were concentrated in Durham's Latino population.  >70% of new cases both months were from Latinos, who make up only 14% of Durham's population (these and other numbers from Durham's COVID dashboard [1]).  Construction was the top industry of infected males both months, and >90% of the infections there were Latino men.  Unemployed was the top industry of infected females, where >70% were Latino women. The apparent infection vector is Latino men getting infected at the job site and bringing it home to their families.  At this point, 8.5% of Durham's Latino population has *tested* positive.  Extrapolating that into overall infection numbers is not exact, but using Youyang Gu's formula [2], it would be about 7x tested numbers.    So that means ~60% of Durham's Latino population has potentially been infected at this point, which puts them into the range of herd immunity.  Because of strong segregation, transmission between racial/ethnic groups appears to have been less common (else other groups would have risen along with Latinos), but infections among whites and blacks have now started to climb, meaning there might be another wave coming for those populations, possibly spilling over from the high Latino infection rates.  1 - https://durhampublichealth-durhamnc.hub.arcgis.com/  2 - https://twitter.com/youyanggu/status/1291092314224578561
Haha. If I knew that, I would have quite a career as a public health expert.  Couple potentials: - better focused interventions in workplaces/locations with high rates of transmission - increased mask wearing - more social distancing - the 11PM no-alcohol rule  The problem is that all of those potentials may be wholly responsible for the drop OR they could have had zero impact. Just really no way to know for sure with the data available.  Although I will say that reading through the weekly observations that the county puts out might help shed some light on what happened.
I'm guessing the virus worked its way through the most vulnerable groups and they're either over it or have passed away because of it (but are never the less not-positive anymore), or there was a cluster they tested around the first of June.
Thanks! I was wondering if it corresponded with the mask mandate in some way. I’m glad we are staying in phase 2 since things appear to be working finally. I’m nervous for the return of all the college students.
I also worry that the decline over the past 2 days is a bit 'fake' and that we are caught up in whatever testing weirdness is happening at the state level. It might not be the case since we are on a sustained decline, but it does worry me.  The state has been reporting an unusually low number of tests and apparently they are having a hard time getting results from one of the providers. They expected it to to be resolved yesterday, but I do not think that it was.  >The bad news: One of the state's leading commercial labs was late in reporting data, meaning the full result was likely much higher, and that total was still unknown by Tuesday afternoon.  [https://www.wral.com/coronavirus/nc-sees-data-delays-lowest-coronavirus-numbers-in-two-months/19230446/](https://www.wral.com/coronavirus/nc-sees-data-delays-lowest-coronavirus-numbers-in-two-months/19230446/)     Edit: Looks that error does not impact the number of positive or the percent positive (which seems counter-intuitive, but is explained). Good news is that our slowing of transmission appears real!

>the 11PM no-alcohol rule  https://www.cbs17.com/news/north-carolina-news/north-carolinas-statewide-curfew-on-alcohol-sales-at-restaurants-begins-friday/  >“We’re hoping this new rule can drive down cases – particularly in young people,” Cooper said.  https://durhampublichealth-durhamnc.hub.arcgis.com/datasets/ca0b75bc3855496182a240d5532c6db6  >The median age of unemployed workers who are COVID-19 positive is 36, for construction workers 37 and for hospital workers 34.5  https://covid19.ncdhhs.gov/dashboard/cases (44% of cases are 25-49 years of age)  -The booze curfew is gonna be the least helpful thing out of all this, unless "young people" means 18-50 years old, which is a very wide swath of ages.   I will say it that there's some combination of "all of the above" (Lower Herd immunity threshold, masks, social distancing, etc) which is driving down our cases in Durham and statewide.
This is a great point.

Duke University has tested more than 3,100 students for COVID-19. 4 cases were found

I graduated from Duke this year. My grad school colleagues in the class below me says that they have to schedule their tests in the next two weeks before they can even come close to campus.
This is actually a really good way to measure the active infection prevalence in the (student) population, not just the prevalence among those who seek out testing. It might artificially bring down the state's test positivity numbers though.
Meanwhile down in Raleigh at r/NCSU, we’ve only performed 3 tests so far
Reading the article it looks like they are taking contact tracing very seriously. Hopefully they can stay safe this way.
Well if we didn’t test so much we wouldn’t have ANY cases!
Duke is taking this VERY seriously for everyone on campus. I have to fill out a symptom log every morning. I was honest one morning about having stomach issues the night before (even though likely from a gas station hot dog). Had to go get tested.
The fact that they tested broadly and found those 4 cases likely means that those 4 will not mushroom into 40, then 400, then 4,000. This is not only good for Duke, but good for the entire city Durham. (And this is coming from a Tar Heel.)
Give it time.
4 then 4 more... maybe just 4 more
Okay
Congrats on graduating (and nice username btw). We should be thankful we dont have to deal with classes and projects and tests on top of COVID like your peers are having to deal with. Sounds like a nightmare.
Whether or not it changes our positive test rate might depend on where they're from - undergrads coming in from out of state, who get tested at home, likely are counted in their state's data
hard to know who all was at that party though.
Yeah, they've "redeployed" staff from some departments to be full-time contact tracers
4.0 cases. Not great, not terrible.
Props for the perspective and for taking the risk on a gas station hot dog.
I used to throw caution to the wind when it came to food. Then one night I ate a bunch of hot food from 7-11 at 2am after drinking with my friends. Twenty minutes later I laid there in regret, as my stomach hurt enough to prevent me from sleeping. I didn’t throw up or anything but I experienced a lot of physical discomfort. Never again.
If they maintain a ratio of 4 positive cases per 3,100 tests, I’d be damn happy with that
Thank you! Yes, I cannot imagine everything they have to deal with.
These tests are being conducted in Durham by Duke.  They have converted one of their HVI labs into a covid-19 testing lab for surveillance testing of their academic faculty, students, and staff.  Although I'm not sure if they students will be counted as "NC residents" in the NC testing data if they're from out of state....
r/Chernobyl shout out 😏
I think that's pretty great
Please tell me the meter goes higher than 4.
That is a risk I will never again take....
I tried my best to convince the employee health nurse it was the hotdog. While being mildly amused at my stupidity, she wouldn’t let me off the hook for the damn test.  It hurt. But not as bad as my stomach that night..... I feel you. Never again.

Durham Co. COVID-19 Case Count Update for Aug 12 (-31%)

Well it’s steadily going down, so this just makes me more happy to be in the durham area
Yesterday's report for Durham Co. included 31 new cases and 0 deaths. Over the past 2 weeks, we have averaged 45 new cases per day.  For some additional context, in the prior 2-week period, the state-level positive rate was 8.1%; over the past two weeks, it was 7.5%. Taking the wider view (past 2 months), the state-wide positive rate was 8.0%. Note: the state updated a month's worth of test counts because of a reporting snafu with LabCorp. The positive rate shown here includes the updated figures since July 11.   Should we keep at our current rate of growth (-31%), on Aug 27, we would expect to have seen 432 new cases since today (30 per day, a decrease of 14 per day compared to the current period).
im just wondering whenever we get good news, people are like naah, wait till tomorrow, it will spike back up because of these people. I prefer postivie vibes.
Wait till the parties at Duke get going
Yes, but I will say, with all the reporting issues that the state has been working through, take these figures with a grain of salt for the next few weeks.
It's good news if it goes down, for sure.   In the grand scheme of things it's best thought of as "less bad" IMO - per capita cases as a whole are still relatively high. People want good news because it means normal is closer than it was before. For any of these numbers to be actionable - in the sense of any sort of reopening being remotely responsible - we need to get to a place where there the region has the ability to do contact tracing, and turn around test results immediately. Basically to track all instances of the virus as it spreads and quarantine all connections with the infected person. IE getting it under control, as they used to talk about before it went to shit here and people were satisfied with merely trying to keep hospitals from overflowing.   I've seen different numbers thrown around with regards to what is realistic, but from what I've gleaned it's still beyond the local resources. If herd immunity does start to play a role, this lower infection rate will likely be reached sooner, so it doesn't discount the value of that, if that is indeed a statistically significant thing.  So basically - good news that it's going down. Still too high for it to signal that behavioral changes are acceptable.  And before the resident "restaurants are fine" comment comes up - they're a source of many outbreaks all over the country still, and with more data about aerosol spread coming out and how really any indoor environments that aren't controlled being risky (6 ft or not), I expect this to continue. No, it's not to the degree of essential worker spread, but definitely to the degree that many people still find on the wrong side of a risk/benefit calculation.
AIUI It's the positivity rate that matters. That's the percentage of tests coming back positive and it's been steady for weeks. It needs to come down a couple of percentage points to indicate a true decline in transmission.
People were giving positive vibes in May
Cases and positivity reported by the state were unaffected by yesterday’s disclosure of inflated Labcorp aggregate testing volume.
Will do, still I appreciate it every time you post these

Durham Co. COVID-19 Case Count Update for Aug 13 (-31%)

Yesterday's report for Durham Co. included 48 new cases and 0 deaths. Over the past 2 weeks, we have averaged 44 new cases per day.  For some additional context, in the prior 2-week period, the state-level positive rate was 8.0%; over the past two weeks, it was 7.2%. Taking the wider view (past 2 months), the state-wide positive rate was 7.9%.  Should we keep at our current rate of growth (-31%), on Aug 28, we would expect to have seen 427 new cases since today (30 per day, a decrease of 13 per day compared to the current period).
Will the college testing numbers be included in these totals or are they exempt from reporting?
I don't see any reason that they wouldn't be included. I assume that the state would want them in the totals.  Anyone heard different?
Just to be clear I haven’t heard or seen anything indicating otherwise - just assuming based on their best interests and my experience in college where even criminal activity is investigated and handled  “internally” to the school.

Durham Co. COVID-19 Case Count Update for Aug 14 (-34%)

Yesterday's report for Durham Co. included 46 new cases and 0 deaths. Over the past 2 weeks, we have averaged 42 new cases per day.  For some additional context, in the prior 2-week period, the state-level positive rate was 8.1%; over the past two weeks, it was 7.1%. Taking the wider view (past 2 months), the state-wide positive rate was 7.9%.  Should we keep at our current rate of growth (-34%), on Aug 29, we would expect to have seen 392 new cases since today (28 per day, a decrease of 14 per day compared to the current period).
Great news but I’m nervous that we’re going to see a September spike with colleges and schools opening back up
Thanks for this!
Good news?
https://durhampublichealth-durhamnc.hub.arcgis.com, so no one else has to type out the link like I did. :)
This still includes the hurricane-related drop in testing, right?
Can I go to the gym now please?
That's certainly possible. Hopefully the measures that are in place blunt that a bit. Like DPS being all-remote for 9 weeks.
Depends on your definition of success. Certainly a better set of numbers than a month ago.   I'm encouraged though.
Yes, for a few more days, then it will switch into the prior period.
That’s how we go right back where we were unfortunately.
You too can be part of the 592.

Should we keep at our current rate of growth (-36%), on Aug 30, we would expect to have seen 366 new cases since today (26 per day, a decrease of 14 per day compared to the current period).
Wow I love these updates. Best one yet!
So is Durham just killing it compared to the rest of the state? There was a bit of an increase reported   https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/iar20e/nc_reports_1536_new_covid19_cases_saturday_as/
Wonder how the growing UNC epicenter is going to effect this
Do you have a rollup of all the data points so far?
Cases are down in Wake and Mecklenburg counties and statewide, too. (Probably true for lots of counties, but I only personally track Durham, Wake, Orange, and Meck)
> So is Durham just killing it compared to the rest of the state?  This comment explained it the best, for what's happening in Durham:  https://old.reddit.com/r/bullcity/comments/i7slwq/durham_co_covid19_case_count_update_for_aug_10_28/g159gwe/  With the rest of the state, there is some wonkiness going on with testing counts and so forth. Probably another week or two to see how that fleshes out

Durham Co. COVID-19 Case Count Update for Aug 16 (-35%)

Yesterday's report for Durham Co. included 37 new cases and 0 deaths. Over the past 2 weeks, we have averaged 40 new cases per day.  For some additional context, in the prior 2-week period, the state-level positive rate was 7.8%; over the past two weeks, it was 7.1%.

Should we keep at our current rate of growth (-35%), on Aug 31, we would expect to have seen 365 new cases since today (26 per day, a decrease of 14 per day compared to the current period).
Glad to see this number go in the right direction!
WTH is going on with this data?   This seems unrealistic after months of consistent values.
considering the back to school cases won't show up for a couple more weeks it will probably go back up.

New grant program designed to help NC Small Businesses impacted by COVID-19. Accepting applications through September 1st.


Durham Co. COVID-19 Case Count Update for Aug 17 (-34%)

I'm curious how this will change in the coming weeks. Duke students are arriving and we saw what happened with UNC.
Yesterday's report for Durham Co. included 37 new cases and 2 deaths. Over the past 2 weeks, we have averaged 39 new cases per day.  For some additional context, in the prior 2-week period, the state-level positive rate was 7.9%; over the past two weeks, it was 7.1%. Taking the wider view (past 2 months), the state-wide positive rate was 7.9%.  Should we keep at our current rate of growth (-34%), on Sep 1, we would expect to have seen 365 new cases since today (26 per day, a decrease of 13 per day compared to the current period).
Lots of Durham folks work at UNC, let’s see what happens
Duke students moved in between the 7th and 10th, so they've already been here at least a week. Additionally they were all tested before moving in and have been part of surveillance testing since. [According to Duke](https://twitter.com/WRALSarah/status/1295508586702024705) they've found 11 cases.
Yeah, that's probably one of the big unknowns at the moment. The flip side is that Durham Co. is way more than just Duke. So the effect could be swamped by the fact that the populations affected are "relatively" small.
I am waiting to see this as well, but from what I understand Duke's approach from the beginning has been - and continues to be - better and more comprehensive than UNC's.  UNC's approach is best though of as the Board of Governor's approach - very few people people involved with the day to day at the university ever wanted this plan to go through but had no choice. BOG is a bunch of trump ball garglers without a lot of regard for what's actually happening on the ground at the university and were essentially giving the command of "just deal with it" from on high.  Duke is private and can make their own educated decisions and hasn't been hamstrung by the appointees from the stupid ass state legislature from the start in the same way.
College students are a relative small part of Durham's population. I don't expect them to make up a vastly disproportionate amount of cases, like we saw happen with other groups earlier in the summer. Not to mention that much of Duke's student body comes from Northern states, who got hit earlier than we did anyways. Good chance that many Duke students (from NY, NJ and other states) may have had this virus already or exposed to it in some fashion
Today's the first day without the hirricane-related dip in testing, right? I've been adding 20% in my mind ever since that...
Again - if it is easy to do, I'd love to see the daily case counts for the past 4 weeks. I love seeing the trends.  Also - any thoughts on the lower testing numbers nationally and if you are seeing that effect here in Durham (apart from the Hurricane day, of course).
The undergrads did, but many grad students aren't back yet. Duke has ~6k undergrads and ~10k grad students.
It may not be as northern as you think. States ranks from [2018 freshmen enrollment](https://www.collegeraptor.com/colleges/academics/Duke-University-NC--198419#:~:text=Duke%20is%20an%20extremely%20diverse,well%20as%20Texas%20and%20California.):  NC 234  CA 166  NY 153  FL 113  NJ 110  TX 92  VA 75  GA 64  MD 58  IL 58  No other states above 50. SC sent more than MA or CT, for example. TN sent more than ME, NH, RI, DE, VT combined.
UNC saw 120 cases in a matter of weeks.  Not sure what the relative enrollment numbers between those two schools are, but that level of increase would represent a 20% bump over the numbers from the last 2 weeks if it happened in Durham.  Also, I don't think there is much to support your last point there beyond speculation.
> s at the moment. The flip side is that Durham Co. is way more than just Duke. So the effect could be swamped by the fact that the populations affected are "relatively" small.  The downtown durham population is something like 20k. The duke student population is 15k. For the city of durham, the return of the students is a major impact.  There are reports of plenty of maskless pool parties at the apartment complexes downtown the past week....it may not be here yet, but it's coming.
Testing reported today and yesterday (at least state wide) is down quite a bit from a month ago, even when accounting for Monday/Tuesday dips from reporting over the weekend. The previous 5 days were pretty normal though.
Not sure when you define the dip as, but the "current period" is now 8/4 through 8/17.
Do the grad students move away and come back? There's no housing for them on campus, so they'd all have year-long leases and all the grad students I've know have had research and stuff during the summer even if they hadn't had classes. I assumed all, or at least most, grad students were in Durham all summer long.  Edited to add: Looks like most of the grad student research labs [opened the beginning of June](https://today.duke.edu/2020/06/duke%E2%80%99s-labs-are-back-business-new-way), so I'd imagine a ton of grad students have been on campus for a while now.
Yeah but 3 Northern states make up the top 5 (NY, NJ, FL), that's a big percentage
Duke has about 15k students and UNC has about 30k. Town of Chapel Hill has about 60k people while Durham has about 250k, though the point in this thread about the downtown Durham population is an interesting one.
>The downtown durham population is something like 20k. The duke student population is 15k. For the city of durham, the return of the students is a major impact.  You're right when you look at it as just downtown Durham, but it's a lot smaller proportion wise Duke to Durham County than UNC to Orange County though (15,892:321,488::30,011:148,476). (Using county level data because that is the most widely available from both County Health departments and the state)
The exponential nature of contagion also makes even a small cluster, especially in areas as dense as downtown or Duke campus, a major concern.
> maskless pool parties  Unless all those people are also crowding *indoors* that's less of a concern. There's been plenty of stories regarding outdoor parties that didn't turn into much.  Like the Lake of the Ozarks parties over Memorial Day:  https://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/health-official-covid-19-cases-missouri-parties-71069249  https://www.cnet.com/health/is-it-safe-to-go-to-the-pool-lake-or-beach-during-coronavirus-what-we-know/  >The CDC says there's no evidence the coronavirus can spread to people through pool water and that proper cleaning with chlorine or bromine should inactivate the virus if it's in the water.   Remember the various predictions for the raceway in Alamance County? Thousands were in the stands for those car races. Y'all forgot about that  https://abc11.com/ace-speedway-terry-johnson-open-memorial-day-weekend/6208793/
Ah ok. Isias hit on Monday the 3rd, so maybe it's just on the cusp.
I can only speak to the law school, but a lot of students there left Durham and either sublet or just ate the cost. Since classes moved online before last semester ended, some people went home in the spring and are just now coming back.
:-)
Thanks for that info
https://www.alamance-nc.com/covid19/wp-content/uploads/sites/77/2020/08/Weekly_Demographic_Surveillance_websiteAugust17.pdf
From your second article:   “While the coronavirus may not spread easily through pool water, say if someone spits out a big mouthful they accidentally almost swallowed, it could still infect people in close range when heads are out of the water.  For example, a group of people chatting in the shallow end, or playing a pool game may be more likely to acquire the virus from their companions' breath or saliva (e.g., through shouting to be heard at a noisy pool) than from the water itself.   In addition, pools, especially public ones, contain high-traffic areas and surfaces that are touched often, like the railing on the steps to get out of the pool or any doors to enter the premises. The principle of social distancing is to keep people far enough away so someone who may not know they're infected doesn't pass the virus on to another person, or a group of people. Bathrooms, lunch lines, shady indoor areas and any place where people come in close proximity can increase your risk.”  A pool party can still be a source of transmission if the people are hugging, horse playing, lounging outside of the pool, chatting in close proximity. All of which were witnessed. u/uh_no is probably right...

Duke announces 11 COVID-19 positive results out of 5,765 tests (0.0019%)


Durham Co. COVID-19 Case Count Update for Aug 18 (-31%)

Yesterday's report for Durham Co. included 15 new cases and 0 deaths. Over the past 2 weeks, we have averaged 38 new cases per day.  For some additional context, in the prior 2-week period, the state-level positive rate was 8.0%; over the past two weeks, it was 7.0%. Taking the wider view (past 2 months), the state-wide positive rate was 7.9%.  Should we keep at our current rate of growth (-31%), on Sep 2, we would expect to have seen 376 new cases since today (26 per day, a decrease of 11 per day compared to the current period).
For u/dolver, here are the case counts that make up the periods being visualized above:  Current Period (8/5 through 8/18)  2020-08-18 - 15  2020-08-17 - 37  2020-08-16 - 37  2020-08-15 - 34  2020-08-14 - 46  2020-08-13 - 48  2020-08-12 - 31  2020-08-11 - 30  2020-08-10 - 26  2020-08-09 - 67  2020-08-08 - 32  2020-08-07 - 41  2020-08-06 - 57  2020-08-05 - 42  &#x200B;  Prior Period (7/22 through 8/4)  2020-08-04 - 28  2020-08-03 - 43  2020-08-02 - 44  2020-08-01 - 57  2020-07-31 - 70  2020-07-30 - 62  2020-07-29 - 57  2020-07-28 - 54  2020-07-27 - 54  2020-07-26 - 47  2020-07-25 - 66  2020-07-24 - 55  2020-07-23 - 93  2020-07-22 - 54
For the first time in quite a while, the estimated number of active cases is below 400 (6478 confirmed cases, 6101 released from isolation equals 377 estimated active).
Does anyone know whether college students living on campus (say, at Duke...) will count as county residents to be included in these figures? Or will they technically be filed wherever they are "from" as far as residency purposes?
Good info and it looks to be a statewide trend as we are now back to case counts seen in late June.  Deaths, however, appear to holding at just under 30 per day which is twice as many as we saw in late June.  Hospitalizations are down from the 7/29 peak, still around 1,000 daily.
Theres been a huge dip in testing the past couple days, what gives?    https://covidactnow.org/state/NC?s=908179

Wow this is crazy. I worry / wonder what Duke will do to these numbers.
Thank you for doing this every day!
Thank you!
I've been recording the hospitalization figures, but I haven't incorporated them simply because I've focused mostly on the Durham Co figures.   Would you be interested in seeing them in the narrative comment section? If so, what are you curious about?
They will (eventually) be reported by their usual place of residence, which typically includes most college student residence scenarios.  It’s a bit of a chain of events though. If the positive lab report lists mom and dad’s out of state address, the report will be sent to that state. From there, the home county will need to investigate. They will be tipped off seeing an out of state ordering provider on the report, will likely contact the student to confirm. Finally they will send an interstate case notification to NC, which then gets processed by the state health dept. and assigned to the county health dept.
I think there are two factors to this:  1. Fewer test requests as more younger people are infected, but asymptomatic 2. Fewer negative tests being reported as a larger percentage of tests are performed by facilities who are only required to report positive test results (e.g. Walgreens)
No problem. Just glad that it is helpful!
>Fewer negative tests being reported as a larger percentage of tests are performed by facilities who are only required to report positive test results (e.g. Walgreens)  Why? What's the purpose behind this?
I think there's a bit of mis-understanding here.  All locations are required to report the total number of tests administered to the state.  However, they must only report the identity behind positive tests.  So, the report to the county and state looks like this:  We did 138 tests yesterday, and here are the names, addresses and phone numbers of everyone that came back positive.  But we do know exactly how many tests have been administered.
Ok - that makes more sense. Thanks for the explanation.

Durham Co. COVID-19 Case Count Update for Aug 19 (-31%)

Yesterday's report for Durham Co. included 35 new cases and 0 deaths. Over the past 2 weeks, we have averaged 38 new cases per day.  For some additional context, in the prior 2-week period, the state-level positive rate was 7.8%; over the past two weeks, it was 6.8%.

Should we keep at our current rate of growth (-31%), on Sep 3, we would expect to have seen 372 new cases since today (26 per day, a decrease of 11 per day compared to the current period).
I wonder if it would be helpful to pull the Y-Axis out further (make image longer) and also add another line on the same graph showing the value of total cases. I think a lot of people won't realize how much -31% for multiple weeks will have the numbers.
If you are curious about the larger-graphic view, I would check out the source of the information. The Durham Co site has a nice big graph (albeit with some strange axes).   [https://durhampublichealth-durhamnc.hub.arcgis.com/](https://durhampublichealth-durhamnc.hub.arcgis.com/)

Yesterday's report for Durham Co. included 45 new cases and 0 deaths. Over the past 2 weeks, we have averaged 37 new cases per day.  For some additional context, in the prior 2-week period, the state-level positive rate was 8.0%; over the past two weeks, it was 6.8%. Taking the wider view (past 2 months), the state-wide positive rate was 7.9%.  Should we keep at our current rate of growth (-29%), on Sep 4, we would expect to have seen 373 new cases since today (26 per day, a decrease of 10 per day compared to the current period).
While that’s good, it’s still an uptick of 524 additional people.... the number we are looking for is 0
> the number we are looking for is 0  Why is that?
Because virus bad.
It shows that there are 524 additional infections..... we want 0 additional infections. No?
> we want 0 additional infections  probably not happening until we get a vaccine  we're going to see continued flare ups here and there
Very true!

Duke Coronavirus Plan
Is it safe for incoming freshmen to come to the Duke Campus and Durham area or is it better to study online for the fall semester? Will coronavirus get worse?
I think it depends on your home life right now. If you have a safe and happy home, then stay there if you can. If your home life isn't a safe place, then it might be worth the risk.   Just make sure you take the precautions if being socially distant, wearing your mask, and washing your hands.
This is quite possibly the worst place you could go for that information.
Not safe. Stay home.
I think it's risky.  Duke plans to test all students as well as faculty and staff that have contact with students, which is comforting imo.  NC's cases have been increasing steadily, but schools opening could cause a spike. Even if you follow proper mask usage,  distancing, and hygiene, I doubt that 100% of students, faculty, and staff will.  And if it does spike,  they'll probably send people home again.
Considering Duke's excellent job with kids returning from spring break I doubt they will be better off this time. I'd stay home if you have the option.
I would actually bet that being on campus for fresh/sopho will be pretty safe. Duke is a major university, and while they can’t prevent everything, I bet the dorms/dining halls/used buildings will be kept extremely clean.
I think this is good advice.   If OP were a junior or senior, instead of a freshman, and could live off campus, the risk might be reduced a little, since they could control their own living/eating spaces a little better. But as a freshman, I would stay home if the home situation is safe.
To be fair, most of that is on the b-school students themselves.  The undergrads did not return from spring break, and some of the b-school students were the ones that traveled to places with outbreaks, and returned not to dorms, but to their own apartments in Durham which were their full-time homes.  Some self-quarantined responsibly, but according only to rumors, there were at least one or two that were spotted in bars NOT quarantining.  Also, back then, there were so few tests, that they only tested people who showed symptoms AND had contact with others with COVID-- a consequence of the low test throughput in the US at that time.
That was 5 months ago when nobody knew anything and it was a major chaos scramble. If they haven’t gotten their act together now... that’s just pretty sad for a major uni

Coronavirus in Durham County: How we compare to NC and US cases

Let's keep up the good work in the Bull City/County.
Data is from  [https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data)
We were in Michigan recently, and they have mandatory (for indoor public places) mask laws, backed up by a $500 fine.  I never saw it enforced, but it's way better up there.
I think we are trying. However I was in Lowe's (S. Durham) this afternoon and there was this maskless AA woman running around in the paint department. I was surprised she wasn't wearing one knowing how Covid impacts POC that she would be maskless especially since Lowe's provides masks.  Edit: She was the only person I noticed without one. 🙁

In the meantime, it’s important to  take the best care of ourselves and our communities as possible, which  means staying apart for now. “Obviously we want this to end as quickly  as possible,” Meacher says. “But the truth is we just don’t know.” "Thanks for reading!

This is this weirdest article...what is that photo? And it dives into rimming within the first paragraph....
Huh. I wonder if those adult bookstore things with gloryholes are doing more business because of corona.
>which means staying apart for now  This advice almost reads as, "don't have sex until you're married"  Maybe a more pragmatic stance is in order here, because we know that [people are going to have sex regardless](https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2020/08/24/hookup-casual-sex-dating-tinder-pandemic-one-night-stand/).  Not to mention the past attempts to control behavior in regards to preventing teen pregnancy and STD's. Most of those approaches didn't work.
Is it possible to have sex with the coronavirus?
that's def. a third paragraph topic.
We're both wrong, it's the 2nd.
you're more liberal than me.
