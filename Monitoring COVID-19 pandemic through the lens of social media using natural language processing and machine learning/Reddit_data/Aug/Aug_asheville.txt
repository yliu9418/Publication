Blaze pizza here. We all wear masks and won’t serve you without one
Ingles has it posted that you must wear a mask however they are not enforcing it (at least on the one down liecester hwy).
The Regeneration Station - (The curated antique/vintage mall where my booths are)  - requires masks in order to enter and shop- no mask, no visit. They’ve had to turn away a fair number of angry people- most early on, less of a problem now. They had masks for sale at one point but I’m not sure if they still do.   - has shortened hours (12-5) every day except Tuesday when we’re closed   - has virtual/personal shopping as well as by-appointment shopping (usually on the closed Tuesday) for anyone who doesn’t want to come in and shop with a full house on a busy day.  - also, The regeneration station’s Junk Recyclers service is still operational and takes all masked/sanitary and distancing precautions when working on your property.  We’re all still doing our best to find and stock weird and cool stuff for our Asheville friends, though it’s gotten harder to. We’ve lost some booth vendors to the economic change, but seem to have gotten some new ones in just as quick.
Advanced Auto Parts is doing nothing. No signs requiring masks, No masks, no plexiglass, no distancing.    Auto Zone has signs, employees wearing masks, plexiglass, social distancing.
Juicy Lucy’s - Saturday I went for takeout and people were fully packed in. Also a group of about 20 bikers was heading in when I arrived for my takeout order, all without masks. 😕
Went to Home Depot and it was about 60% mask wearing. Probably the lowest I've seen.
Bank of America has security to enforce mask wearing, they won't serve you without one. However, most of the branches have been rotating closures because of low staff, and COVID-19 cases.
Cúrate and La Bodega by Cúrate require masks, and are conducting regular (voluntary) randomized testing of employees from different areas of the business, as well as all managers. Staff are empowered to invite guests who don't wear masks as requested to kindly GTFO.
Cook out - tunnel rd  I went to get take out yesterday, of the 3 people I could see in the window, all 3 had their masks on their chin or below their nose, and one guy touched his nose, practically picking it, with a pointless glove, then went back to handing out change
Why is there no mask exemption for kids 12 and under.  I see this a lot - I'll be in a store or getting take out somewhere and the mom and dad are wearing masks but they don't make their kids wear masks, and then their kids are often roaming around, not paying attention on their phones, or playing tag, i.e. not paying attention to six foot distance. I learned that that's actually one of Governor Cooper's exemptions, and it does not make sense to me. Sure, I mean it's different if a kid has severe intellectual or developmental disabilities which make wearing the mask challenging, and/or they have intense medical concerns and need to be able to communicate - but this does not apply to majority of parents letting their kids roam maskless. Is anyone else frustrated by the stupidity of this? I mean what the heck, kids spread it just like adults do. If you know that your child is ABLE to wear a mask, and you don't enforce it then you are part of the problem. I want to honor the fact that parents have a tough job, and that it can be hard getting kids to follow rules, but it just seems irresponsible for parents to give up because they want to avoid arguments with their kids. Was that exemption based on outdated and incorrect assumptions that kids are immune to COVID?
I am not really on the mask shaming train, but what I witnessed at Black Mountain Goodwill on Saturday was far worse than an employee with a pulled down mask or their nose sticking out, etc. One of the employees who is also a manager was wearing a face shield with no mask and was very obviously sick, coughing almost non-stop while putting merchandise on the shelf, sneezing and sniffling. Some of the employees of this store are elderly as are many of the customers. Probably a good idea to get tested if you have been in that store recently and avoid it if you haven’t. I contacted Goodwill of WNC about this today. Hopefully they will read my message and do something.
Hillman is doing it right. Gloves, masks, sanitizes pens between use, sanitizes gloves between customers, and even cleans credit card before returning
Burger King in Weaverville has unmasked folks preparing, packaging, and ringing up the food. Thankfully they didn't give me a hard time when I asked for a refund and told them why I wouldn't accept the food.
Asheville Sharp (new sharpening service) can do curb-side / contactless knife sharpening with sanitization.
When we do guided trips at Appalachian Riverboard Company, we wear a mask during the shuttle and sanitize the vehicle before and after a trip. We also provide masks if we have different households in the same vehicle during shuttle.
  The following is an excerpt from the CDC site:  https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cloth-face-cover-guidance.html :  Face Shields A face shield is primarily used for eye protection for the person wearing it. At this time, it is not known what level of protection a face shield provides to people nearby from the spray of respiratory droplets from the wearer. There is currently not enough evidence to support the effectiveness of face shields for source control. **Therefore, CDC does not currently recommend use of face shields as a substitute for masks.** However, wearing a mask may not be feasible in every situation for some people for example, people who are deaf or hard of hearing—or those who care for or interact with a person who is hearing impaired. Here are some considerations for individuals who must wear a face shield instead of a mask: Although evidence on face shields is limited, the available data suggest that the following face shields may provide better source control than others: Face shields that wrap around the sides of the wearer’s face and extend below the chin. Hooded face shields. Face shield wearers should wash their hands before and after removing the face shield and avoid touching their eyes, nose and mouth when removing it. Disposable face shields should only be worn for a single use and disposed of according to manufacturer instructions. Reusable face shields should be cleaned and disinfected after each use according to manufacturer instructions or by following CDC face shield cleaning instructions . Plastic face shields for newborns and infants are NOT recommended.
Etowah Ingles. Was there tonight. At least half of customers not wearing masks including at least two people in scrubs who most likely work in health care. I shop there a lot and this is the worst I’ve seen it.
I have mixed feelings....  House on clingman always places their yard waste in the bike lane.  Saw them on their porch for the 1st time as I was biking up the hill avoiding getting hit by a car because bike lane was blocked  I yelled bike lanes matter  I have mixed feelings about that  But really why you blocking the bike lane?
You fucking moron. Look at all the other countries. We won’t be back to normal ever because of science denying dumbfucks like yourself.
Wearing my mask for 20 seconds while I walk to my table, and then taking it off for the next hour while I eat is one of the dumbest things I've ever done.  COVID apparently really, really hates people standing or walking.  Also, no beer at 11:01 PM or else the virus will getcha!
Have you heard of anyone getting sick from takeout food, include any restaurant, not just Blaze? Every time this question is asked of Drs on TV they say it is “unlikely” but never say it has been proven one way or the other.
Blaze pizza has saved my sanity with my kids at home. Yall are awesome!
Your pizza is fast food quality, and it sucks.  Thanks for further confirmation that we ought to avoid you.
Swannanoa Ingles as well. :(
ditto Smokey Park Hwy Ingles
I tried to report Ingles and it turns out the Governor created an order that can only be enforced on very small businesses. The owner has to be present, on-site, to be given a citation. Since that’s impossible with every corporation and nearly every business, effectively no no one can be cited.  Either it was stupid wording of the executive order (generous interpretation) or a sneaky “make it look like I’m doing something” political maneuver (cynical interpretation).
And skyland ingles. Though I’ve only seen a very few Chad and Ken dudebros that couldn’t be bothered to wear a mask in there. I’d say 95% of the shoppers there have been compliant.
the one on tunnel does not enforce it either and many of their employees walk around the store without a mask, and ones who do wear masks often have their noses sticking out of the mask.
Lake Lure, Tunnel Road, & Mars Hill ingles all have signs posted, none are enforcing.  I asked the cashier at Mars Hill what the deal was, she just shrugged her shoulders and said "Manager said not to make a big deal of it."  I didn't notice any employees disregarding the rules, but plenty of customers.
The OReilly's on Patton were all wearing masks and had clear plastic shielding up to protect employees. The one on Riverside Dr had no masks, nothing.
There is a high correlation between dude-bro’s who are mechanics for living or fun and the anti-mask league (Republicans).
I can vouche for this in both Hendersonville (battery check, no one in store was wearing a mask, employees or customers) & Arden (needed wiper blades, only one employee wore a mask, no customers were wearing)
>ber of angry people- most early on, less of a problem now. They had masks for sale at one point but I’m not sure if they still do.   >   >has shortened hours  Don't they know they're ALL GONNA DIE?!?!?!?!  No plexiglass?!?
Unpopular opinion but Juicy Lucy has issues with kitchen cleanliness before covid. Many friends have had stomach bugs after eating there. It is a good location and convenient but we have stopped going after repeated issues.
interesting, I went to the HD in Hendersonville and was surprised at how many people were wearing - I only saw a few customers not wearing, most were, and I didn't see any employees not wearing.
Did you try the spicy chorizo quesadilla watermelon milkshake?
Probably based on low expectations of kids' ability to understand the issue / follow directions. As a parent, I can say...MANY parents are just lazy when it comes to engaging with their kids. I know plenty of toddlers who can understand what's happening on a general level and keep a mask on. But other kids, even when older, probably can't due to years of checked out parents who don't bother to talk to them. 🙄
IDK, their tables look way too close together to me.
I thought the credit card car wash a strange step but I was not going to object to "just a moment while I clean your card for you"
#SAY IT WITH YO CHEST SON
I agree brother. I HATE wearing shoes and shirts and these dam businesses ARE STRIPPING MY FREEDOMS of going into AMERICAN BUSINESSES without shoes.
> Wearing my mask for 20 seconds while I walk to my table, and then taking it off for the next hour while I eat is one of the dumbest things I've ever done  Why do I doubt that?
takeout food is usually completely enclosed in the kitchen, and lately I've seen it bagged up where they tie knots in the handle before it comes out to public air-space. Plus everyone in food prep is "pretty much" already used to wearing gloves/hairnets so a face mask isn't really asking much different than normal. And those grease fryer exhaust vents = air circulation!
Not that I know of. Specifically at Blaze we are very careful and sanitize and disinfect constantly. Like if money touches our counter we immediately disinfect the area and change our gloves immediately after handling money.
i'm coming down from NE Ohio soon-ish; they closed the Blaze in my hometown faster than i could even visit! just after the Keto dough came out, I'd say.
Says the Newborn Redditor whose prepper shelves are likely lined with dented, cheap ass cans from bargain hut.
Tha k you for the effort in reporting them. I couldn't risk my job right now in trying but its ridiculous that they've given an order that won't be enforced.
What sucks is when *alt-right* mayors or sheriffs sign executive orders saying "you must NOT wear a face mask for your personal safety" ---- that's literally like passing a law that says "BY GOVT DECREE: you are not allowed to wash your hands after going to the bathroom. we found that reduces infections so you're not allowed."
I’ve never understood the popularity of the place, especially now with overcrowding instead of socially distancing.
Uh oh! I’ve eaten there a lot but I also have a lot of digestive issues and am nauseous somewhat regularly, so I could have been making it worse this whole time!! 😱😱
Only ate there once, years ago. Felt like I was gonna be sick all night. Thought it may have been the date I went with, but never returned just to play it safe.
Any restaurants tables are too close together right now. We just did takeout
False equivalencies are all you sheep have.
Lol... ok zoomer.  COVID clearly doesn’t affect you if you’re sitting at a table.  Lmao.  But you walk to the bathroom... wooooh buddy, you’re ripe with the virus.
Naw. They got scammed into buying the special 5 year supply for just 4 easy payments of $1999. Easiest money the NRA ever made
wait hillman is doing takeout?!
WAKE UP SHEEPL!!!! am i rite lol
Comply and don’t ask any questions. You’re the problem.  This sort of thing happened in Germany in the 1930’s and 40’s... started small.

4 Asheville City Schools athletes test positive for COVID-19 | WLOS

Literally the least shocking thing ever. And yet Buncombe County has suspended all community testing until an undisclosed time in August. Why aren't they mandating testing for all children returning to school? No way will I be sending my kids to the slaughter for some shoddy political agenda.
Weird!  I meant to say "totally predictable!"  The next few weeks are going to be a shitshow for schools and sports.
All schools need to be on Plan C
Yes let’s ruin these kids future who’s only hope of going to college depends on their sports scholarship, it really shows how much you care about the less fortunate kids stuck in the communities you’ve been out there protesting and rioting for.... Let’s just shut it all down long enough for our political candidate to try to use voter fraud to make it into the whitehouse, these kids futures be damned.... I don’t ever want to hear some sappy bs about how “educators” give a flying rip about the students when they’re asking for an increase in pay and benefits... The one silver lining to this Chinese Virus has been its totally pulled the curtain back on what these people’s real intentions are, and they’re all about themselves....  This is just the preamble for them to cancel high school sports until January... Good job losers your going to leave 2 years of underdeveloped students and student athletes in your wake after this is all said and done... Whatever I guess when your party celebrates partial birth abortion as a right, then what’s crushing an entire generation of student growth...
Why is this news?
7 deaths out of 38000 cases in minors is .01%, pretty low risk.
THESE KIDS ARE NOT GONNA THROW THE FOOTBALL GOOD! IF YOU CANCEL THE FOOTBALL THROW THEY WILL FAIL AT EVERYTHING! (insert weird political point clearly spoonfed by President PoopTerd Tweets) TEACHERS ARE BAD, THEY THINK THEY SHOULD GET MORE MONEY TO TEACH KID THROW FOOTBALL?|!? DO THEY NOT CARE ABOUT THE FOOTBALL THROW!? VIRUS NOT REAL ME REAL SMART. DERrrpppPP  Your worried about High School sports. Who gives a fuck g. You don't think teachers should get paid more...yet you think it is a horrible crime to not have kids go to school...sounds like you think school is IMPORTANT...youd think if it was so important the people running the school should get paid more...  That voter fraud shit is so fucking stupid. I don't even like the Democrats and I think its stupid.  I don't know what they should do, but I don't see much harm in closing schools for a year. Kids are resilient. They'll be fine. I'm more worried about the parents having to hire sitters.
So sports scholarships are the only hope for the less fortunate to go to college?   Isn't your whole thing pretending *not* to be racist???
It is news because schools are getting ready to go back and there is a nationwide push to open them up like normal.
Why are you the way you are?
Why would it *not* be news?
Why do you care? Just skip to the next post if you’re not interested in this topic
Why do you care? Just skip to the next post if you’re not interested in this topic
Because all four of these kids will die.
My wife is a preschool teacher, guess she doesn't matter?
There are other people in the school that aren’t minors and they are important to consider as well.
Yeah I’m not clicking on that, feel free to share whatever it is
Where is this pretense of racism coming from? It’s widely known most disadvantaged kids get to be the first ones in their families that get to go to college on a full athletic scholarships and grants from their sports ability.... Then when they get to college they can decide if sports doesn’t look like a viable career path then they can still drastically change their lives for the better...
trolls gonna troll...
>this is what the Republican Party stands for.  His mother had the flu when she was pregnant with him, or on drugs, or alcohol.  Oh that's right, she didn't believe in vaccines and this is the result
Idk but why is this news? People are gonna get it. Stop reporting every single case and freakin people out.
 Vaccines have killed kids...would you consider that a preventable death?  You also know that VAERS and victim compensation fund for vaccine injury was set up to protect pharma (and their profits) from vaccine injury lawsuits and payouts?
Ya know that whole thing about opening schools again? Yes. I would like to hear about this kind of shit while people are thinking its a good idea to reopen our already fucked up school system. Just because these things don't affect YOUR life doesnt mean that other people don't need to hear about it.
>Jetterman  And we'd have fewer cases if we just stopped with all this testing  /s
All of this was preventable if China just never experimented with it.
> No preventable death is acceptable, no one should have to die for shareholder's money.  The number is irrelevant if the death is preventable, correct?    Pharma already has the protection they need.  Each COVID vaccine will get immunity from liability just like every other vaccine has had since 1986.
lol you have a really skewed idea of 'news' if you're spouting this bullshit...
in the whole of mainland China which has A population over four times the size of ours… They had under 5000 total deaths  In our country (which knew the coronavirus was coming) AND had months of additional time to prepare AND the benefit of seeing how other countries who were affected earlier responded... we’ve had 159,000 deaths. We are currently having about 1000 people a day die in this country from this disease.  This falls squarely on the shoulders of your stupid ass orange president who at first claimed the virus wasn’t going to come here. Then this dumb fuck said it was going to come but there would be just a few cases and then it would magically disappear. Then he said it’s here but it’s not a big deal it’s just the flu. Then he said when it got hot outside the sunlight would kill it.   Yesterday he said people are gonna die, but “it is what it is“  So fuck you
Nah he reacted very early and was criticized by your hypocritical ass electives. Democrats literally want the worst for this country. We are the last standing capitalist society and we need to eradicate all others from this country. If you don’t want a capitalist country then move out because there’s plenty of socialist countries out there.
The fact that we have reintroduced measles into society is [literally a dystopian nightmare](https://library.smcm.edu/2014/08/parable-of-the-sower-by-octavia-butler/).
No other countries will allow us in because of the way we botched this whole thing 🤷‍♂️
oh jesus man you’re fucked up

Covid-19 in U.S. - 15 States with more Cases from 1 March to 2 August

It’s crazy watching that.  It makes it look like California, Florida, and Texas did it on purpose.
Well, they are the 3 most populous states in the nation so its somewhat proportional.  North Carolina is the 9th most populous state in the nation and where is its position the graph? 9th.
And yet they spent two months nowhere even close to their positions relative to their population.  They were light years behind New York until towards the end of June.  They knew exactly what to do to control their numbers and they did the opposite.
Well i guess that’s true of every state. They all used to have 0 cases. Not sure your point. That’s the evolution of the spread of the disease. We can’t stop it. The idea behind the shut down, the social distancing and wearing masks is to slow down the rate of infection so the hospitals don’t get overwhelmed and to help buy time while they develop some better anti viral treatments. Look at NY and NJ deaths. 32,719 and 15,929 respectively. That’s what happens when you don’t slow down the virus. California has 9,510 and Florida has 7,402. When you consider the deaths as a proportion of total population Florida has 33 per 100K. CA has 24 per 100K while NJ and NY have  178 and 164 per 100K. Those are the real numbers to watch. Btw NC is looking good with 19 deaths per 100K of total population
My point is that the massive increase in infections was avoidable.  If they had kept doing what they had done in April and May they’d have way lower positions relative to their population.  Of course we can stop the spread of disease.  Plenty of places did it.  We just chose not to do the hard work, or at least a certain segment of our population chose not to.
>My point is that the massive increase in infections was avoidable.   thats true for every state. this isn't some kind of perverted competition on who's the most virtuous.
I bet Rhode Island would win.
[this link](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1109011/coronavirus-covid19-death-rates-us-by-state/) keeps a real-time tally of deaths per 100K in population
You know who's really looking good in deaths per hundred thousand? Most other developed countries.
Oh man I was way off about Rhode Island.  Filthy clam harvesters!
For real.  The Covid situation reminds me of that Onion article that goes viral again every time there is a school shooting.  “‘No way to prevent this,’ Says only Nation where this regularly happens.”
Yep, [we’re not the highest](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1104709/coronavirus-deaths-worldwide-per-million-inhabitants/) but almost!

Buncombe to set 9 p.m. booze curfew as COVID-19 'enhanced mitigation strategy'

This is LITERALLY the only tool the ALE will have to cite a bar for being open dangerously. Bars are open all over Buncombe county serving poppers and claiming to fall under the miss spoken words of the Governor . Hosting live music inside with no regard to capacity or masks. The local ABC, sheriff’s and Fire Marshall’s are not enforcing any of the states mandates. I was told today that I could still not open my bar bc the food portion of the business was not on the initial map I used to apply for the license. Meanwhile the guy down the street is hosting an arm wrestling competition indoors. My bar has been closed for almost 5 months. Please by all means make as many mandates as you want to help control the spread of this virus, but if there in NO enforcement we are again only giving lip service to an issue that will still remain.   As a side note there is a bar in Asheville that has now had to close twice, and test all employees twice due to Covid positives. Bars DO spread this efficiently, but it doesn’t much matter because the majority of them are open.  Just after I wrote this I walked outside of my home in Swannanoa to hear the new bar down the street and their heavy metal band playing. This bar opened in May 2020.
Maybe we should refuse to sell alcohol to anyone with a Florida driver's license.
What a completely ludicrous idea. Hotel occupancy is 100% but let’s target local small businesses trying to stay afloat? Shameful
Close the damn breweries.
ASHEVILLE - Buncombe County likely will establish a 9 p.m. curfew on liquor sales at restaurants as an "enhanced mitigation strategy" designed to address "trouble spots" in the local spread of COVID-19.  The prohibition comes on the heels of an executive order from Gov. Roy Cooper that went into effect July 31, halting restaurants' sale of alcohol statewide after 11 p.m. It did not affect retail liquor sales.  Buncombe emergency preparedness director Fletcher Tove told county commissioners Aug. 4 that health officials are **still seeing patrons congregate closely at "restaurants, which are fundamentally bars, but because they produce food, they're operating under restaurant guidance."**  "We have several places around the county where we're getting reports and we've observed that, late at night, it looks like they're not complying with their capacity limitations, nobody's wearing masks, people are packed in, so we're trying to focus down on some trouble spots there," Tove said.  Other areas of concern for health officials have been gyms and downtown Asheville, where people have not been wearing face coverings outside, on the sidewalk, despite being close to many people.  #### Local measure depends on Cooper decision  Cooper has yet to announce whether he once again will extend Phase 2, which is currently set to expire at 5 p.m. Friday. If he does, it will be the third time the phase, which the state began May 22, has been prolonged.  "We don't have any indication yet from the state which direction we'll go, but looking at the same data the state's looking at, we can imagine an extension of that pause or staying somewhere in Phase 2," said Tove.  Unless Cooper opts to move into Phase 3, Buncombe intends to remain aligned with North Carolina in its coronavirus response in all but restaurant liquor sales. **Health staff recommended the 9 p.m. curfew to "focus specifically on those trouble stores which are fundamentally operating as bars while bars are closed,"** Tove said.  "We think it's reasonably a late enough hour that people can still go out to dinner and have their drinks, but it's going to kind of remove incentive for that kind of socializing," said Tove. "We're seeing people just kind of loiter at these sites. ...  "If it was last summer, it'd be a different issue, but this year, it's not acceptable for people to be loitering in those close quarters for hours at a time without masks, without social distancing."  Commissioners did not formally vote on the measure, but, when county staff asked for guidance, Chairman Brownie Newman summarized a preference to follow the state's lead in all but the further limitation on liquor sales unless Cooper announces a plan to move into Phase 3.  "Restaurants can still stay open," Newman said. "If you are getting a late dinner and things like that, that's fine. Basically, we just don't want the restaurants turning into bars later in the evening.  "And since we do have a lot of tourists here, not like every other town in the state, there are a lot more people who are coming here to go out and get some delicious beverages that are manufactured in our county. I think there is good reason why this could be a more significant concern here than in your typical town around the state."  Newman said later he will sign an updated local order later this week. It likely would go into effect at 5 p.m. Aug. 7 alongside a new executive order from Cooper.
They caved pretty quick on that one  [https://wlos.com/news/coronavirus/buncombe-county-alcohol-sales-9pm-11pm-brownie-newman-restaurants-bars](https://wlos.com/news/coronavirus/buncombe-county-alcohol-sales-9pm-11pm-brownie-newman-restaurants-bars)
The ABC store is raking in the monaaayyy
This blatant mini tyrant Cooper and county Commissar Newman are really over playing their hands.... 9 fucking pm? Good riddance on Election Day Newman.... Newman just single handily ruined every single service worker, retail workers after work life, what a fucking idiot...Looks like Kid and Play are going to be back in business because house parties are about to come roaring back...   9pm cutoff for alcohol I wonder what genius came up with that one  I’m really getting to where I don’t even give a damn anymore.... Kiss all the bars goodbye, kiss a lot of your restaurants goodbye that were surviving off increased late night alcohol sales.... It’s obvious as fuck Newman and Cooper want all these places out of business, all of you wanting old Asheville back because you think “old” Asheville was 2002 are damn idiots, we might get to visit Asheville of the 80’s early 90’s and let me tell you it was fucking awful.... If you moved here after 1997 then all you know is the up and coming Asheville, you never experienced the shitty Asheville...
Because it totally can't be spread before 9 pm, right?
Amen
Wait a metal bar in Swannanoa? Hell ya, what’s it called?
Anyone not from WNC. Basically you have to reside in NC-11 if you want to drink in Buncombe county.
Let’s just close all of the things forever until there is no more death for any reason, right!?  For you panicked folks on this sub who disagree, downvotes are on the left.
Yeah but Westville isn’t packed to capacity at 12PM and it definitely is by 9PM. It seems like this may not be the most effective way to stop the spread, but this should - at the very least - help break up those giant crowds that keep forming.
Are you cool if we reopen all the "bars" then? There's a lot of local businesses that remain closed since March that are no different than these restaurants that are acting like "bars."
Hotel occupancy is not 100%, it's 60-80%, per the hotels.  You're referring to the restriction, but I don't know if you have the capacity to understand the difference.
Odd measure given the falling case numbers in the state.   Seems as if most of these actions are more about exercising power rather than any sort of meaningful plan related to the public good.
The village idiot is on the loose!
someone has a full diaper!
No, because restaurants and breweries are abusing the rules and essentially functioning as bars, which can be the most prolific spreader of the virus.
Y'all Gonna Die
Totally ok with this. Locals are being held hostage by the stupid acts of tourists. Perhaps set up "locals only" bars and restaurants.
Ah yes, why don’t we simply require someone to have travel documents to leave their home.....  Let’s fully lean into government oppression eh?
Or, I don't know, allow all the bars to open? This policy just levels the playing field so that restaurants can't act like "bars" — which they have been doing since April.
We'll just wait for the "I thought it was stupid to take precautions but now I have COVID-19" meme.
Nice whataboutism... are you ok with the hotels being at 100% while the city targets businesses and alcohol sales as a way of saving face without pissing off hotel owners?
I see this as ensuring that cases continue to fall. We have a number of people visiting from out of state, some of which have hot spots greater than NC.  If they are excercising power as you say, to what extent do you think is the purpose of doing so?
You mean like the private clubs, which are _the only bars required to be closed right now??_
Have you lost anyone to Covid in a preventable way? I've lost several. Death is the highest form of oppression.
We just need a brigade of concerned citizens to roam the streets enforcing rules like this, by force if needed!
Absolutely not. I think hotel capacity should be limited to 20% and only necessary travel. I think ALL non-retail alcohol permits should be revoked until we get this thing under control.
I think hotels should be closed to all leisurely travel. Bars however are a Hotspot for COVID.  They are full of "deniers" and even those who aren't are much more willing to hug and be close to others. It's that whole lowering of inhibitions thing that is the problem. Bars should be restricted to a 2 drink maximum.
Now that there are no longer on-going mass gatherings in the streets, it seems very probable that numbers will continue to drop.    I did notice that the state is questioning the data now that it is showing a large downward trend in cases, and is only using data through Sunday to help justify continuing to keep NC closed.  I do not have an answer for the purpose, other than the tendency of officials in general to horde power whenever possible.....  Seems more of a general human flaw than a conspiracy that drives this, if that’s what you’re asking.
I have not known anyone to die, and few enough to have suffered significant illness from it.  However literally everyone I know has had massive impacts to their lives for many months.
Like some sort of well regulated militia?
Meh. Most of the mass gatherings I saw in person or through media were wearing masks. Still not the best idea as it relates to the virus. My take is the peak we saw was delayed from people's slow uptake on taking this seriously. I think it's likely more complicated than "protesters alone caused a spike".   The only reason I ask is because usually there is some sort of financial reason other than power for powers sake, e.g. money or political favors (=potential for money). I would argue that most businesses aren't liking not making more money while at the same time (most) understanding mitigating virus spread.  Do you have a source or link for the state questioning data?  I do agree with you that it is a general human flaw.  Stay safe and healthy out there
Probably questioning the downward trend since trump has taken control of the numbers and doesn’t believe actual scientists over “doctors” who believe in demon sex giving people COVID19
Bold faced selfish....
Then stop complaining about oppression and do something about it. My dead friends had ALL of their rights taken from them.
What would you have me do, start riots like the BLM folks in May?   Interesting that the daily case count started upwards not long after that, and didn’t peak until the middle of last month......
What are you doing where you've had multiple friends die of this?  I'm sorry for your loss but the knowing people that have died from it don't justify what is happening.
[Many, many studies](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.forbes.com/sites/tommybeer/2020/07/01/research-determines-protests-did-not-cause-spike-in-coronavirus-cases/amp/) refute this claim you keep making.
Stay the fuck home, wear a mask, support government policies like this one which are designed to SAVE LIVES and are not an assault on your rights or oppression. As I said, DYING from something entirely preventable is the only real oppression. Everything else is a vapid talking point and frankly my dead friends and I are tired of political posturing. I'm speaking for the dead.
In what way? Are you saying that you can justify the death of your fellow citizens because what, you need to get a beer at 9:30?
So there is no need for the lockdowns and social distancing?  I mean the protests created more social interaction than we've had for the last several months.  And don't say anything about protesters keeping their distance and they were all wearing masks because that is simply not the case.  It seems like you support eliminating the lockdowns, and letting businesses open given the above.
I don't think that the protests alone led to a spike in cases, but I am sure that there was some Covid spread at the protests. Your articles don't refute that either. The studies say that there was overall an increase in people staying home during the protests because more people decided to stay home to avoid downtown areas so no net increase. Also the virus is less likely to spread outdoors, and the demographics of protestors skewed younger so many protestors may have gotten Covid but not had noticable symptoms and therefore not have been tested.  That said, when people insist that the protests didn't spread Covid it is very obnoxious. It comes across as, '*You* will spread Covid if *you* go anywhere near people, but *I* will not because the people *I* choose to associate with are far more morally superior than the people *you* choose to associate with.'  I have seen several people online who claim that no Covid was spread at the protests because everyone was wearing masks, which is not true. Lots of people were wearing masks, but not everyone. Masks help. We should be wearing masks when we go to businesses as required or if we are in close contact for a long time. Most places in Asheville are doing pretty well from what I've seen. I just wish people would stop acting like it's the end of the world every time they see someone without a mask on.
You’re correct, there are a large number of studies that refute the facts that are clear via the state’s own website.   The 7 day rolling average between 5/25 and 6/2 was roughly 600 cases/day.   Fast forward 3 weeks and you see roughly 1,300 cases/day and increasing....   Of course I’m certain that increase had nothing at all to do with the large scale riots..........   I’m as sure of that as I was of Mr. Cooper’s 2 week “safer at home” order was only going to be for two weeks......
What is your long term plan?   Was someone that was killed while driving a car oppressed?  What about the skydiver whose chute did not open?  What about the 60,000 people that died of the flu in 2018?  What about the deaths caused by the lockdown?  What about the years of quality life you are taking from the younger people?
Your dead friends are too dead to have much of an opinion....   Nice of you to appropriate their memory for your own use though!  Further, since you seem so entirely focused on them, why don’t you direct your self righteous anger towards them for not taking adequate precautions?   Or maybe you can find it in yourself that they made their own choices as adults, and have suffered the consequences l?   Either way it’s utterly disgusting that all you bring to the conversation is their memory....
Damn it's almost like y'all [keep making the same arguments](https://www.google.com/amp/s/elemental.medium.com/amp/p/252f32aa9817) over and over...
Gee do I need to teach you about correlation and causation, too? I swear some of the people that try to act the smartest on here are the most ghoulish.    Yes, the numbers went up. Natural to ask to question of whether it was caused by protests or not. Oh, there's many scientific studies on just that topic with evidence saying no.  Then a logical person would start asking more questions, like, did that timing coincide with increased testing here? (Yes)....
In a sense, sure, if they're deaths were caused by the actions of others. Their inalienable right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness was absolutely repressed.   Someone who causes the death of another due to negligent action is definitely an oppressor in my world view. Failing to follow basic health recommendations is an act of gross negligence.
God you are dumbbbbb and the reason this virus will continue on and on.
Right, my friend that was in a hospital for necessary surgery that picked up the virus from a hospital worker is the one who made poor life decisions.   I know I will not change your mind but at least have some fucking empathy.
Callous and rude?    Check!  Lack of understanding of basic science?    Check!  Using a derogatory slur?   Check!   It's the Asheville sub right-wing trifecta!
So address what I've said to you several times, that you don't seem to have an arguement for.  I have seen MORE than 1 live feed with protesters not wearing their mask and passing joints.
You are absolutely correct, correlation does not equal causation.  However, in this case it is very difficult to believe that there is not a linkage.  We know that a lot of the data from that time is flawed, as in many cases contact tracers were instructed to not ask if someone had attended protests....  Also, while there appear to have been an increase in testing, that increase was not in line with the increase in positive cases.
I like this.  Let's add smokers, the obsese, those with preventable medical issues like Type 2 diabetes, etc to those acting with gross negligence.  Their failure to maintain a healthy personal ecosystem makes them more susceptible to illness and pose a greater risk to the public health during this pandemic.
You didn't say if they were caused by others. You said that if they were preventable. So there's nuance?
Please explain why I'm dumb? Also why would the virus not continue on and on? That's what every virus except for smallpox as always done.
Empathy is nowhere to be found on this sub. Just lots of people with huge opinions and no facts to back it up. I’m sorry for your losses and the fact that people are so cavalier about 150k+ deaths in America already.
Explain the basic science that I'm missing please
I literally addressed that with the link in the post you're responding to...
It might be difficult if there weren't several scientific studies that specifically confirm it to be true....
Well, we pay for the consequences of their poor lifestyle choices. That cost is figured into every life, health, home, renters and auto insurance premium you pay as well as health care fees and the taxes you pay to cover Medicaid and Medicare, not to mention disability
Just look at how other countries have handled it. It may not be gone but it is not disrupting everyone’s lives the way it continues to do so here. Mostly because our government majorly fumbled and now no one will take precautions as they are suggested to do because “the government wants to control us” etc etc.
By claiming I was being hypocritical for supplying evidence the protests did not produce a Covid spike, while not supporting a full reopening of the economy.    While many protestors were wearing masks (something you seem to have trouble with), the most important reason the protests did not cause a spike, but a full reopening will, [is the scientific evidence you're ignoring](https://www.google.com/amp/s/elemental.medium.com/amp/p/252f32aa9817).  Edit to add, it's funny that's the one issue you have with my post.
No you didn't.   If all the protesters are wearing masks as you say.  Then WHY have I seen multiple live feeds, of the protesters filming themselves, marching down the street, mask around their necks, passing a joint between several people.  This was all in Asheville.  Tell me again about how all the protesters are wearing masks.  I'm sorry, but it is just not happening as you say.  Which is why people trying to film the latest protest were threatened by the protesters and made to stop filming them.
https://mises.org/wire/media-said-europe-beat-back-covid-now-lockdowns-loom-again
I don't disagree that the protest didn't cause an increase. And I think people that point to it like it did are doing so to point out the hypocrisy of the protesters because they are the ones saying you can't have assembly for things like church.
I never said that. I said many, based on my experience, I can't speak to yours.   No, the reason protestors didn't want to be filmed was because those videos are being used to snatch people up in Portland.   Nobody is defending the actions of a few people that you allegedly saw, calm down.
Sigh. Folks like you cannot he helped. Good day.
And again, for the third time, that is the science you are choosing to ignore. [It spreads much more indoors](https://www.google.com/amp/s/elemental.medium.com/amp/p/252f32aa9817) than out. That would be why anyone has issues with church. If church were doing an outdoor service I'd be 100% on board.
My point is, obviously the virus is also spreading through protesting.  Only a fool would think it wasn't.  Maybe some are responsible and wear mask, but not all.  Not even close.    Yes, videos are how people are getting caught breaking the law.  But no one has the right to threaten people who are trying to film.  ESPECIALLY when the protesters are the exact same people who go around filming everyone else, screaming it's their right to do so, when someone ask them not to.  Again, hypocritical.
Solid retort.
What’s wrong with the link?
Yeah they sure seem like the dumb one.
Where did I say anything otherwise about the spread indoors versus outdoors?  Does the first amendment the Constitution mean anything to you?  Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.  They clearly says no law.  It's pretty clear.
Wanna talk hypocrisy? You have said like 100 times you can't enforce masks because you just can't control people. Why is it you only have a problem when it's a BLM protester?
Guess I'm foolish for believing [the many scientific studies that corroborate what I'm saying](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.forbes.com/sites/tommybeer/2020/07/01/research-determines-protests-did-not-cause-spike-in-coronavirus-cases/amp/).
> So there is no need for the lockdowns and social distancing?  I mean the protests created more social interaction than we've had for the last several months.  And don't say anything about protesters keeping their distance and they were all wearing masks because that is simply not the case.  > It seems like you support eliminating the lockdowns, and letting businesses open given the above.  I apologize if I misunderstood what you meant.
I don't have a problem with it.  I have a problem with people like you, saying it's not spreading the virus, when any idiot off the street, can see that it does.
No apology needed. But what you quoted clearly shows that you did not understand what I meant.
I literally linked to one of many scientific studies, ostensibly not performed by idiots on the street....
I'd love for you to explain it for me, then.
Anytime you wanna clarify, I'm all ears...
Yeah that's what I thought.
So they don't have enough studies to know exactly how this spreads, but you believe they have enough studies for this.  Exactly how did they study it?  Edit to add: you don't think people without masks passing joints, they put in their mouths will spread the virus?
Ok.  You said I claimed you were being hypocritical about not supporting a reopening of the economy.  Your reading comprehension was not so good.  I said that based on what you say about the protests not causing a spike in cases (I'm fine with that assertion because there are just so many variables involved it hard to tell), you seem like you favor a reopening.  You obviously don't, but it sure seems like you do or should.
This [is just one such study](https://www.nber.org/papers/w27408.pdf) including methodologies and findings.
No, because the science literally says that  1. The protests didn't cause a spike. And  2. We can't reopen fully yet because you're much more likely to catch the virus indoors than outdoors. And many people work indoors.   Edit: that's also exactly what I've been saying this whole time, so yes, I actually understood your quoted comment quite well.
But what do YOU think?
Have you read all 71 pages?  This was done by an economic team?  Seriously, use your own critical thinking.   You honestly believe protesters aren't spreading the virus.  Especially the irresponsible ones.
The science?  It's like you can put the word 'the' in front of science and it lends extra credibility.  Science never fully agrres on anything.  For example people say'the' science says that masks work.  'The' science says that lockdowns are the right solution.  There is science that says the neither work as well as science that says they do.  People that haven't a clue about science are great at saying 'the science says' as I'd that shuts the other side down.   When people say 'the science' it always reminds me of the episode of The Office when they had a charity run and gave the proceeds to science    Also, is your goal to keep people from getting it all together?  That's a pretty solid goal if so.  Listen, you're clearly a dude that is never wrong and always has to have the last word.
I think I'm not a scientist so I will listen to the consensus of the scientific community in lieu of anything better. If they come out with studies next week that say the opposite, come find me and I will happily apologize. After some initial confusion, the science has agreed on several things, so I've followed their expertise.   I think the heavy majority of protestors tried to make their voices heard as safely as possible. I wish it weren't necessary to protest in the first place, but I won't begrudge that of anyone right now.  I think it's a shame that we can't band together as a country to beat this thing like we could.
Guess that's what I get for trying to be civil. Have a great night.
Yes, you are 100% correct.
I'm being civil.  I'm just trying to understand your thought process, why you choose to believe the things you do, and why you don't use any of your own critical thinking.
Yes your civility knows no bounds.

Cooper extends COVID-19 restrictions despite risks to economy

You act like you're getting paid to promote this trash website.
Ah yes, more right wing propaganda from Art Pope’s John Locke Foundation.
Now that is not a biased headline AT ALL. (sarcasm)
Here’s my thing and hopefully we can all agree on this.   I run a movie theater and I love what I do. I’m all for closing down businesses that may spread COVID-19 but I just don’t feel we’re being treated fairly.   Restaurants are at 50% capacity but a lot of hole in the wall places are still tight at that level.  Churches are packed to the brim. Lowe’s and Home Depot, the same. Yet, here we are, the almighty movie theater and bowling alley are the boogeyman in all of this. Which is, may I add, kind of weird. We’re easily able to spread showtimes and limit capacity easily. Whatever, that’s fine.   What upsets me is that our business and our employees are not getting any financial support. Basically the state government is saying “sucks to be you” and washing their hands of us.   That’s what pisses me off.
RIP any form entertainment in NC.... These dumbasses really think this will benefit them in the election and they think they can turn on and off the economy like a light switch....
You're pretty politically corrupt to see this as a political decision.
How about RIP to 150k Americans you unpatriotic cunt.

Buncombe to set 9 p.m. booze curfew as COVID-19 'enhanced mitigation strategy'

North Carolina reports first death tied to child care COVID-19 cluster

[r/BrandNewSentence](https://www.reddit.com/r/BrandNewSentence/)

Buncombe has seen 'improvement' in COVID-19 trends, health official says

It's not much, but it's better than things getting worse.
The 7 day moving average as of yesterday is ~30/day down from a high of 44/day on 7/23.
So we were at ~400 cases two months ago and have 2000+ now but things are improving?
We may not have adequate testing, but hospitalization and death rates do tell us something. It's not like we're flying completely blind.  The real question, and I don't know the answer, is: are hospitalizations and deaths declining in our county?
How does that clip relate to the discussion?  How is it misinformation?  Because YOU say so?
And, your source for this is....
The county-run testing sites are supposed to reopen tomorrow. There have still been several places doing testing while they've been down, though.
I don't know anything about how long it takes to provide death certificates, but I thought they were reporting deaths every day. The linked article says that hospitalizations have been in the forties all week which is higher than July. Hopefully it's just a lagging indicator, and they'll drop off in a week or two. But doesn't sound like there's a clear end in sight.
It's almost like you don't want the numbers to get better.  Show me some proof of that.  Just because he made some dumb comment, certainly does not mean that's what happened.  Why do you think that's in his power?  1 clinic in Buncombe County stopped testing because they were overwhelmed around July 22.  Everyone else is still testing.  They have instant tests in doctors offices.    And I have no idea wtf you are talking about with my account.
Everyone at mission has been wearing masks at all times for months. Since March I believe it’s been hospital policy. This comment seems like misinformation or possibly disinformation. I have first hand knowledge of seeing all employees in masks at all times since April.
>but I thought they were reporting deaths every day  the day a death is reported is usually a week or more after the death actually occurred. paper work. bureaucracy.
i hear what you are saying but the testing issue is a state problem. for example, most anyone in florida can get a test when ever they want - no symptoms - just because they think they might have been exposed. the virus is bad down there but the numbers are likely way more accurate than NC's.
What?  Who fucking cares what he said?  The health care system is not ran by the president.  The rest of your reply is just completely off point.
I like he can send federal troops to US cities, bomb people half way across the world, force children to go back to school and suddenly when it comes to health care he is powerless and unaccountable.

True. Smokers have lower risk than nonsmokers of getting infected.

Buncombe health officials brace for flu season, COVID-19 overlap

Seems if you’re already maintaining best practices for avoiding contracting the virus you’ll automatically be protecting yourself from catching the flu. That being said, I’ll be getting my annual flu shot this year. No brainer.
Flu shots are available now. I got mine 3 days ago from a pharmacist who thanked me on behalf of those who depend on herd immunity. *The pharmacist giving the flu shot was allergic*  Can we just take a moment to appreciate the people on literal front lines who need us to collectively be considerate
That’s how I plan to roll this flu season.

Red Cross - COVID-19 Antibodies
Couldn't find where this had already been posted, so I wanted everyone to know the Red Cross will automatically test your blood for COVID-19 antibodies when you donate blood.  Seems like a win, win to me.
Yes, please donate if you can!!
So will Blood Connection. They also keep the blood locally.

Election 2020: No 'I voted' stickers, how to vote safely amid COVID-19 in Buncombe County

Without the “I voted” stickers this year, how will I tell everyone on social media that I am socially conscious and better than everyone else? 2020 just keeps getting worse.
This but unironically
I doubt that the absence of "I voted" stickers in *November* will make a major change in the pandemic.

2nd worker at Whole Foods on Merrimon tested positive with coronavirus

They could have gotten it outside of work just as easy. Lots of people are not socially distancing or being careful in their private lives.
Everywhere will have it. Fauci says a vaccination will only be 40-50% effective. Accept it. If you are obese or old stay home.
Oh no! They were such a conscientious store that was holding themselves to the highest standards, and all the patrons were following all the signs placed on the floor.... Unlike that plebeian Mecca of uncouthness Ingles
Homie the virus can cause clotting in all major organs, lung scarring, hypoxia, cognitive / neurological issues, etc.      The danger with this shit isn't primarly how many people it kills, it's how many people survive with long term issues.
Which would be great advice, if you could do that and still pay for rent, bills, groceries, etc.
Not sure how that information would be helpful at all. This virus affects everyone differently, if these two cases were asymptomatic or incredibly severe, that would not change anything.
Lock downs are meaningless if you lift them too early and then allow tourists from hot spots to come in town. By election day everyone will know someone who died.
Dude 150,000 have died. It's not "just because of positive tests" good lord.
“I don’t know and I don’t have an opinion yet”... but let me spew my idiot opinion regardless.  Good one. Guess 150k+ dead Americans means nothing to you.  Had our country not been a load of selfish fuckers we could have been way better off like every other major country.
If someone is positive and has no symptoms whatsoever, that doesn’t mean they’re less contagious and that the people they infect won’t become ill in a life-changing or life-ending way.
I could say the same thing of you but I won’t. Good day.
With all due respect, this is exactly what the GOP has been banking on. Forcing people back to work by eliminating the extra unemployment insurance, completely irrespective of the fact we are still in the throes of this pandemic.    You are not alone, but please direct your anger at the government that has failed to protect us, not those of us trying to keep each other safe.   Edit: another important aspect of this plan is to cause infighting amongst us - the working class - instead of directing our anger at the members of Congress who are making hundreds of thousands of dollars. The fact you are now questioning the seriousness of the virus is also part of their strategy.

COVID: Buncombe reports 16 coronavirus deaths in 2 weeks

It killed my senior citizen neighbor. She would call me on Valentine’s Day the last few year to check in and make sure I was doing well after a difficult separation. A very sweet lady. This thing is terrible.
My neighbor died from covid
I gave blood yesterday and the lady doing the initial stuff told me COVID is a hoax and a way for the government to control us. She went on to tell me her mother and grandmother died and "they blamed it on COVID". Probably the most scared I've been during the pandemic as I'm sitting on a blood drive bus a foot away from this lady as she draws my blood.
Well over 200,000 dead Americans, thanks Trump. American has gotten so much worse under Donald's leadership.
And? Life goes on. Quit living in fear. It’s absolutely pathetic and isn’t helping.
Sorry for your loss.
I’m sorry
The lady at church who had been attending services there the longest—50 years—died of COVID-19. Her health had deteriorated a few months before the pandemic, and she was in a health facility.
Red Cross or Blood Connection?
when ignorance reigns life is lost..
Last year, an anti-government nut who just happened to be waiting on me at Lowe's decided to "share." I reported her to her supervisor (well after leaving the store).
I just saw a guy walk out of the post office today, rip open an envelope to pull out a bumper sticker and angrily slap it over his Trump sticker, the new one was one of [these](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077GKXMT7/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_i_HBzrFbJZ7D5G1)
I keep hearing is not nothing more than the flu. HAHAHAHAHA. Fucking idiots. in 5 months it has killed anywhere from 4 to 10 times what the flu does the whole year.
Life didn't go on for 16 of your neighbors. No one wants advice from an asshole.
Can you take back death?
Sounds familiar
Blood connection
Just so happens a small one will be nearby on election day.  >It currently has a 0.41% chance of entering our planet's atmosphere, but if it did, it would disintegrate due to its extremely small size
The flu deaths are kind of a hard to picture statistic for some people.  In 5 months this virus has killed:  * Half as many Americans as died in all of WWII (405,399)  * About twice as many Americans as died in WWI (116,516)  * About as many as died in combat in the Civil War (214,938) and about 1/3 as many as all deaths in that war (~655,000) * More than have died in every other war (excluding those three) or conflict the US has been involved in since the Revolutionary War combined (177,749)  [Source] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_military_casualties_of_war)
The flu has a vaccine though...
Bullshit. What was their names? Prove it.  Earth is a sphere more or less. Any other dipshit insults, or do you have something intelligent to contribute?
I personally like to use "units of 9/11" since its hard to argue with that.
What is your point?
And over human history, we've developed enough of an immunity to it that what we experience is mostly an attenuated version of the flu anyway. So when people say, "It's just like the flu," they're not even comparing it to a full flu experience, but one their body has generations upon generations of experience battling. Sadly, this was not true for first-contact Native Americans. Influenza (along with smallpox and a few other diseases) was one of the key factors in North America being nearly depopulated and the first nations significantly politically and otherwise weakened when European colonizers came back in the second wave after the initial landings, as opposed to the heavily populated and highly civilized nations the first landers encountered.
Haha looks like we have a flat earther on our hands.
Thought about throwing that one in there too. We’re up to 59.8 Sept. 11ths today which is just kind of staggering honestly.
They’re easier to visualize death tolls
Cool story bro, point is upwards of 50,000 Americans die with the flu each year, and we don’t give it a second thought because there’s a vaccine.  175,000 deaths is not that many considering it is a novel virus with no vaccine.
> 175,000 deaths is not that many  There is nothing you can say after this phrase that makes that number acceptable.
I'd love you to explain why you find it acceptable that our country has done LESS with MORE than any other country on earth? We have all the science, knowledge, money, etc, but decided to just be fucking stubborn and not follow the playbook that has allowed most of the rest of the civilized world to keep it in check.  That's the fucking failure of the administration.  It isn't a goddamn mystery what to do; literally everyone else in the world did it pretty damn well.
There’s a good handful keyboard warriors on this sub. For some reason these bridge dwellers can’t let others have an opinion that differs from their own. Not saying this person has no right to their opinion, but saying 175000 people dying isn’t that many? Not a good idea to compare the flu to a widespread unknown virus that has, by your numbers, killed 3+ years worth people IN A MATTER OF MONTHS. Do your part and think of others, or as your “good book” says: treat others the way you wish to be treated
Miserable fucking cunt.
Is 50,000/year from the flu acceptable?
> It isn’t a goddamn mystery what to do  Lol ok, which is what, exactly?
I don't downvote minority opinions (for all the good that does here), but I will downvote "cool story bro" every time.  The comment they replied to wasn't even snarky or rude.
It is pretty hilarious to claim I am the one who can’t “let” people have differing opinions.  I am the one getting downvoted and called names for not agreeing with groupthink, bud.    I said, 175k is not that many *considering*, as you yourself acknowledged, it is a novel (previously “unknown”) virus with no vaccine. 50% of the population gets vaccinated for the flu every year and we still see 50k deaths... that we have seen less than 4x as many deaths from a virus that is alleged to be more deadly and more contagious is pretty remarkable, in fact.
Leave my mother out of this.
Not if they were preventable, no.  COVID is a communicable disease, that, even without a vaccine, can be curbed. We know this, because other countries have done it. So, if we could have had 50,000 deaths, but had 170,000, that number is *unacceptable.*
You do exactly what every country in Europe did. Shut everything down, stay home, take it seriously for two months, and then we can all get back to business.  We've had horrific leadership that allows people to ignore the severity, the death, the economic impact, the social impact, the masks, the quarantines, etc.  As a result, we will be dealing with this for years after the rest of the world has moved on.  It's embarrassing and depressing.  There was a playbook for this and it's been ignored here.  I'd love to hear you explain your way out of that one.
Maybe start with a National Testing program and Contact Tracing program instead of "SLOW THE TESTING DOWN PLEASE."
“Cool story bro”... Death is serious, not just data or numbers.. I can voice my opinion just as you did. Name calling aside, making light of ANY death is disrespectful. Thanks for the vocabulary lesson though.
Only 50% of our population gets the flu vaccine every year, therefore annual flu deaths are entirely preventable.  You say that if we had more deaths that we “could have had” that is unacceptable, but in fact we’ve had far *fewer* deaths than were originally projected in March.  In March it was projected that we could see up to 2m deaths without intervention.  Yet we’ve seen more than 10x fewer deaths.  You may believe that we might have had *even fewer* deaths with even *more* mitigation efforts.  But that’s a completely theoretical argument.  You simply can’t prove it.
What would this national testing program achieve exactly?  Around a million people are tested a day, we invested billions in rapid testing in the CARES Act and it is being rolled out as quickly as humanly possible... Many States are not even testing as much as they could be because there is lack of demand.  In the United States we have constitutional rights that prohibit forced testing, you realize?  Which leads into our contract tracing program, which is also limited by our constitutional rights - no one can be forced to provide information, the government can't use phone data to track people down (like they do elsewhere), and again, can't forcibly test.  We are doing the best that can be done within the limitations of system, once travel restrictions are lifted you are welcome to move to more authoritarian countries.
I am not denying anyone the right to their opinion, nor am I making light of deaths.  I would argue those who politicize the death toll are the ones being disrespectful.  I have zero doubt that in the timeline where Clinton is President, the 175k death count is being heralded as a major success story.
Its actually somewhat provable, but we still probably dont have all the data points we need to do so. What we can point to is that there is a very strong correlation to between severity of lockdown as well as compliance with safety measures in a given population and in turn see much lower infection rates and also death rates. Availability of testing, and availability of hospital beds and medical equipment are all highly correlated with death rates. The biggest failures of the us response come from all of those things and can be directly tied to the federal government acting too slowly or not at all. We had a chance to get this right early on, and instead it has become heavily politicized by people who claim it is a hoax or is not a serious threat to the country or anything close to normal.
Damn imagine being this stupid
It is highly unlikely that Hillary would have summarily tossed out the Obama era playbook on how to handle a pandemic, but since we will never know, I guess your point is irrefutable.  Way to make a strong stance on an alternative timeline scenario.  I'll take a swing.  If Kanye West were president right now, we'd all be in flying cars.  Prove me wrong!
> What we can point to is that there is a very strong correlation to between severity of lockdown   Of course limiting contact between people, especially large groups of people in confined spaces, will lower infection rate and thus death rate.  But you are only delaying the inevitable until there is a vaccine.  Look at Europe, two months since re-opening, their numbers are [on their way back up as the US is coming down](https://www.statista.com/chart/22102/daily-covid-19-cases-in-the-us-and-the-eu/).  Why?   >as well as compliance with safety measures in a given population   Totally unprovable.  How do you measure compliance, exactly?  > Availability of testing, and availability of hospital beds and medical equipment are all highly correlated with death rates.    Which is why death rates were so high in the beginning in the Northeast... which is why lockdowns happened... to "flatten the curve" - delay cases until hospital beds, testing, medical supplies were available, get the infection rate down to a manageable level.  The US did this successfully.  > directly tied to the federal government acting too slowly or not at all.   I agree to the extent that Federal government was not prepared with pandemic-level amount of supplies for the States, beyond that, the government didn't do anything that was in their authority to do like close borders, restrict air travel, any later than any other country.  US States issued stay-at-home orders at the same time as European countries.  Some US States never locked down and as it happens, did not fare any worse than States that did, but that's another story.  > it has become heavily politicized by people who claim it is a hoax or is not a serious threat   And?  If it were the case that the virus has spread because many people do not take it seriously, we should see very few cases among those who *do* take is seriously, correct?  Can you point to any data or study that shows a correlation between belief in the seriousness of the virus or adoption of preventative measures and getting the virus?  By this logic, only Trump supporters should be infected?    Whoever is responsible for the politicization, it has mostly been around mask wearing which a fairly harmless argument.  You get the virus from prolonged close contact with others, masks are helpful when you can not distance yourself in situations where you are in contact with others for a long period of time.  In every day life, going to the grocery store or whatever, you are not at high risk, mask or no mask, your odds of getting the virus in passing are basically zero.  Meanwhile, people no matter how seriously they take the virus are not wearing masks in high-risk situations among friends and family, which if I had to guess is where most of the spread is occurring.
[Here is the playbook](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/6819268/Pandemic-Playbook.pdf), please tell me how this playbook would have resulted in a different outcome.
https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2020/06/417906/still-confused-about-masks-heres-science-behind-how-face-masks-prevent  There are links to multiple studies and a variety of sources of evidence that indicate that increases in mask compliance lower spread and death rates. Look at countries like Vietnam, Thailand, South Korea and New Zealand that were able to prevent or significantly able to curtail the impact of the virus by widespread compliance with mask guidelines, social distancing, and other measures.   And I agree that passing people in a grocery store is probably not a primary mode of transmission, but not wearing a mask in a checkout line puts cashiers at risk, and cashiers put customers and coworkers at risk. That said the bigger risks are medium to large gatherings and also confined spaces (convenience stores, restaurants, small shops, churches, meat packing plants etc). And there have been outbreaks in communities that have blatantly ignored guidelines. Look at Alamance County and the ACE Speedway as an example. Huge gatherings in defiance of state lockdowns, and now Alamance County is worse off than many other counties of its size in NC. Same for Macon county, where churchgoers defied lockdown orders, and cases skyrocketed relative to population/population density.
Im not reading all 65 pages, but it seems appropriate for a POTUS to do so
>widespread compliance with mask guidelines, social distancing, and other measures.  I think your emphasis should be on the "other measures".  What the countries you have listed actually have in common, that is most responsible for their "control" of the virus, is contact tracing.  In the US, a coordinated contact tracing program is very hard to implement because of a lack of Federal authority and differences in how State health departments operate, so what our Federal government has opted to do is just provide resources and let States implement how they see fit, which has led to varying degrees of efficiency.  I can't emphasize enough how different the US is from other countries and how it is more useful to compare US States to countries, but whatever.  And anyway, even with contact tracing operations at the scale of other countries, State and Federal government lack authority to use it as effectively.  They can't force test, they can't force quarantine.  And the most effective contact tracers have been able to use cell phone data to track people which can definitely not be done here.  I'm not arguing masks don't "work", but they're largely unnecessary in most common situations.  The cashier at a grocery store is not going to get it from interacting with a customer for one minute or so, especially in a typical scenario where there is little to no talking or close contact.  Reducing risk is absolutely worth it, I just take issue with emphasizing the importance of this.  It is more important to stress masks where social distancing is not possible, or particularly emphasize social distancing.  Anytime you mandate things, it's inevitable that people (especially Americans) will rebel.  Trump has always framed mask wearing as a personal choice and I happen to believe that had their not been such backlash to that, it wouldn't have become a political issue and there would be much wider compliance in situations where masks are really needed.  Give people (esp conservative minded) the freedom to choose and I think for the most part they'll make the right choice, try to make choices for them and they will be defiant.  Macon and Alamance County definitely have had higher proportion of cases to population than elsewhere, but not by much.  We don't know what actual numbers are but I see no reason to assume proportion of undocumented cases is different whereever you go... Confirmed cases in Macon is about 1.4% of population, in Alamance its 1.7%, Buncombe County is 0.8%.  State average is 1.5% of population  I can not find data on *active* cases.  Statewide though there are currently [19,433](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/usa/north-carolina/) cases.  0.18% of the State's population is infected.  About 1 in 500 people.
You suggested that Clinton wouldn't have tossed out the playbook, the suggestion being that had she not, things would have been a lot different.  Yet you haven't read the thing that you believe would have made all the difference.  I assume you are just repeating what you have heard.  In fact, if you actually read it, you'll see there isn't anything in there wasn't done, and that very little concrete direction is given beyond "mobilizing" things.
I'm really disinclined to play the "what if" game.  All I know is your president has fucked this up by not listening to health officials, scientists, epidemiologists, advisors, other countries, previous administrations, etc.  Why is it that out country has struggled with this epidemic more than any other country on earth? Can you explain that?
> All I know is your president has fucked this up by not listening to health officials, scientists, epidemiologists, advisors, other countries, previous administrations, etc.   Given you did not even read the document which you say was critical to dealing with the virus, apparently you just took it as a matter of faith, I am going to guess that you don't "know" this, you just believe it and will reject anything that challenges or potentially threatens your belief.  So I am not sure why I should try to dissuade you of this.  > Why is it that out country has struggled with this epidemic more than any other country on earth?   Probably has something to do with our Federalist system.  Compare US States, who's governors hold the requisite authority to deal with these crises (lockdowns, quarantines, personal restrictions), to other countries and you get a different picture.  Most States were content to flatten the curve and open back up, that was their choice.  In the end it probably won't matter, look at European countries now and how their cases are again rising.  Until there is a vaccine, this virus is going to do the damage that it is going to do.  You can slow it down through lockdowns but the economic consequence is probably not worth it long term.
Look, neither of us has read the thick 65 page document, so WTF is your point?  The president ought to have slightly more patience for reading and comprehension than two jackasses fighting online.  And no, "Federalist System" is a horseshit explanation for our humongous death rate.  "Cases are rising again," yes. But they still have a tiny percentage of our death rates.  "Governors had a choice" because Trump didn't lead.
>neither of us has read the thick 65 page document  Uh.. I have... I wouldn't say that the government actions would not have been different if they read the playbook unless I actually read it and knew that to be true... I guess that is the difference between us.  Also, the playbook is not written for the President...  >horseshit explanation for our humongous death rate  I would argue our *death rate* is mostly attributable to a whole of population approach rather than an emphasis on protecting those most vulnerable to hospitalization and eventual death from Covid-19.  Our case rate on the other hand is absolutely due to government handling and the concern for balancing the economic impact of lockdowns with the spread of the virus.  We chose to maintain infection rate at a level our health care system can handle, rather than try to eradicate it, which many European countries attempted and were only able to temporarily do.  >"Cases are rising again," yes. But they still have a tiny percentage of our death rates.  The US is #10 in deaths per million, behind Italy, Belgium, Sweden, Spain, UK... [Look at the death rates](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/) and then compare to demographics of countries, rates have much more to do with vulnerable population size.  In general, the lower the median age, the lower the death rate.  > "Governors had a choice" because Trump didn't lead.  Such a hollow argument.  What would "leading" have looked like, within our system.  I suspect it assumes both authoritarian powers that the President does not have and symbolic gestures that would have made no difference.
Sure.  Cool.
