Corona Virus At Jakes?

Shit is dummy lit I canâ€™t lie cough
Dumb question, but what is Jakes? Are yall talking about the diners around town? Because their pancakes are great. I suspect you aren't though.  And what the fuck goes on there that there is a thread about them every day. What am i missing? lol
Rumor is an employee tested positive for COVID.
I think this is now an ongoing joke after someone made a post "Cops at Jakes?" a few days ago that was really short and kinda weird
If I had to guess they are referring to the bar and the propensity of people on here to freak out and beg for any bitnof info anytime. Ops are seen in it's vicinity. Basically the Greensboro subreddit is a bunch of nosy cunts and these people are.making fun of it
