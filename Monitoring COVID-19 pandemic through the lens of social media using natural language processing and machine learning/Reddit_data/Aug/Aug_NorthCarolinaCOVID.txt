Thank god for Coronavirus
I deliver for Dominos around the Mooresville lakeside area and ever since Covid I have been making 100-175 dollars a shift. And with contactless delivery being the norm, I usually dont even have to interact with people. I was scared about being out of work when this first started but now things are better than ever for me! LOL I just find it kinda funny how theres good in every bad situation
I have increased my tipping amount during this because I definitely wouldn’t want to be going around to people’s houses right now. Prior ably increased my dominos frequency too, to be honest.

On behalf of every Dominos driver, we love and thank you. But yeah that seems to be the mindset for a majority of customers. Its kinda awkward sometimes though, some people act like we're heros putting our life on the line lol. I have to explain that nah man we're jchillin just doing our job. Give your thanks to the police and people in healthcare! haha
thanks mr bot
No, you deserve the extra tips.  I genuinely appreciate delivery in a way I never have before.  I get doordash sometimes and I tip through the website. However, I read one time that they don't pass that on to drivers.  I wish I knew how to make sure the driver gets that money.
I hear you! And yeah, tip your nurse!
leave a cash tip taped on the door or on an envelope under a chair cushion/door mat, and leave a note on the order (idk if thats possible with the doordash app) letting em know where they can find that sweet sweet delivery money! Thats what people do here if they're paying with cash
I don't have any cash though, or a way to get less than $20 bills.
