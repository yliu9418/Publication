Ohh they are believe me!
The real question isn't infection count at this point, it's mortality. And I'm talking honest mortality, not this "everyone who dies with the virus is a COVID death, regardless of how they died".  Shutting down an entire world/country economy over a virus with a 3-4% mortality rate is silly. Yes, I know people will die and that is undoubtedly tragic. Just like people die from natural disasters and other things, we all wish it weren't so but that's not the hand we're dealt.  But to be so naive to assume we can just turtle forever and everything will be okay is foolish. The longer this goes on the more and more economies will tank and that directly relates to jobs/peoples' livelihoods and even suicides. People being evicted/foreclosed with their children, and worse.  We will get through this, just like we have for the last thousands of years.
Good.
I just need the list man...who's stayin, who's goin, line em up!

Better late than... oh wait, neither is acceptable! Why has this taken so long?
Nursing homes have been a shit show for some odd reason, here and elsewhere. And I don't mean in the typical way, I mean as if it's been absurdly mismanaged and negligent by those in charge.

There have now been two clusters of COVID 19 in NC schools in the last 28 days - all with only summer staff levels and no students.

Shouldn’t schools be required to test students and teachers every day or 2 with contact tracing if schools reopen?  And everyone wears a mask?
I have been working in a school lately. I have to buzz into the building. The lady at the front desk has a monitor showing her who is hitting the button and she has to unlock the door. I have never seen this woman or any of the other faculty at the school wearing a mask. Blows my mind she doesn't even bother to mask up before unlocking that door.
I’m going the virtual route. My kids don’t like it but it’s the safest way.
According to the guidelines, no. They only have to require masks, take temperatures before entering the building, and send students home when sick. All of that along with the social distancing is to be done “whenever practical” which doesn’t mean much for enforcement since none of those things are practical in a traditional school format.
At minimum, yes. In reality, we aren’t even allowed to use Lysol wipes in our classroom.   This is going to go great.
Gay, imagine your reddit mom telling you, you can’t go to school and see your friends anymore.
Why forbidden to use Lysol wipes?
Probably cause of allergies or some kid might be an idiot and lick it.
I’ve heard different reasons. We were told that it was a 15k violation to have them in our classrooms. I’ve also been told that we “aren’t trained” to use them.

I love how this article is about COVID and a person refusing to wear a mask, yet decides to spiral into a Trump/BLM tangent for no reason.  Imagine if I was writing about the failed CHAZ state and decided to throw in Pelosi/Biden rhetoric and anti-abortion nonsense.

Teachers: Risk Level, Someone In Your School Is COVID-19 Infected
 [https://covid19risk.biosci.gatech.edu/](https://covid19risk.biosci.gatech.edu/) The tool is constructed for "events." But, I think it works as a rough calculator for school risk too. You can enter inputs and the output is at the county-level.

Schools aren't gonna open, they won't tell you until the night before the first day, but they aren't opening.
I agree. I think you have to "look ahead" when they say: It's 2021 - we got it under control, come on in. "Trust me." :-)  You gut reaction is your best indicator. But, you have "one tool in your tool box" to make an independent judgement (if you are second guessing yourself).  It's just my two cents.
Walmart is putting out their back to school supplies. I’m hoping they know something we don’t know.
That depends on whether it’s a Republican or Democrat controlled county. Just watch.
Unless they're selling qualified teachers ignorant of science, good luck. At the end of the day, when you don't have staff, you don't have school. I say this not aggressively or to be a jerk, I KNOW I sound that way often, it's very rarely intended, I do my best.  I say it to warn you. I say it so you don't plan on taking your kid to school and then realize at the last minute that they aren't going. I say this so that you don't go to walmart and spend your money buying supplies you won't need. I say this because not enough people are aware that this is indeed going to be the case.   Go check out some of the teacher subs, or other social sites...they aren't coming in, they aren't risking their families, they aren't risking their own children.
Well, I meant from the Governor. He'll block schools from having in person learning at all imo.
Maybe it was homeschooling supplies...
I doubt it. I think he’s tied his ship to the Plan B sail and is going to sail her till she sinks.

>Fewer than 10% of the population has been infected, meaning the other 90% is still susceptible, she said.    This is a terribly misleading statement by Swann.  There is very little evidence of long term immunity (and already a couple of studies showing immunity lasting only a few weeks), and it's not clear if contracting one strain of SARS-CoV-2 provides any immunity to the many other strains of SARS-CoV-2.    The N&O shouldn't be spreading this "herd immunity" misinformation.  People aren't wearing masks because they hear things like this, together with the misinformation that "only .5% of people die and over 80% show no symptoms" and figure they'll just get it, have no problems, and be immune.
The thing that should be discussed more is the fact that we don't know what long term effects happen after contracting covid. Autopsies of infected people showed an enormous amount of clotting in many more places other than the lungs. No one knows for a fact that if you are asymptomatic that you have no internal damage. This is not to be messed with.
Yeah until Nov 4th comes and then it’ll all magically be okay again.
>There is very little evidence of long term immunity (and already a couple of studies showing immunity lasting only a few weeks)  Are you referring to the studies based on antibodies no longer being found in patients? Antibodies alone don't necessarily equate to immunity, there are myriad of other factors at play. The "golden" equations of these variables... well we still have no idea what would equate to long term immunity for this virus. [Explained more here.](https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2020/07/07/more-on-t-cells-antibody-levels-and-our-ignorance)  Not arguing against your overall sentiment here, just legitimately curious if there was something I missed.
But those stats aren't necessarily wrong. It is only that small of a death chance and most people do show little-to-no symptoms. Even doctors will tell you that.  Not every COVID patient ends up on a ventilator or in the ICU as people would like to make it seem. Just like the flu, if you consider yourself a higher risk due to age/health factors, then take precautions for yourself. That simple.  I'm sick of people acting like every person age 15-25 not wearing a mask is going around intentionally coughing and smearing germs on everything they can.
I’m curious- where does that line of thought come from? Do you believe that after the election the disease is going to disappear?
From the Trump sycophant nut huggers.
I don’t mean in the biological sense.  I mean in the sense that all this overblown fearmongering and misinformation/misreporting of it will cease.  It’s insanely obvious it’s being used as a political weapon. “Sorry we cant have presidential debates, COVID! Sorry we can’t have normal elections, use a fraudulent system instead to vote!”  This is a desperate way to influence the election.
Your argument would only make sense if only one side is engaging in fearmongering / misinformation; there’s a strong case to be made that both political parties have done this, even allowing for science changing as we learn more about the virus.
My argument isn’t contingent on any “one side or both sides” fallacy.  In fact, it’s just as likely for both sides. One side is pushing too hard to make the other side look bad (or their own agenda) and the other side is pushing back.  The reality is that people need to realize we don’t have anywhere close to a realistic or true picture of what’s going.

Affiliation: Rowan University Health and Behavioral Integrated Treatments (HABIT) Unit  Study Title: Coping with Mental Health Concerns Related to COVID-19  Study Description: We have recently launched a study investigating the mental health consequences during COVID-19 and how individuals have been coping thus far. You will be asked to answer several questions about your experience related to COVID-19, mental health symptoms, and substance use. In addition, you will be asked about the ways in which you have been coping that may help inform treatments for others who are struggling with the psychological impact of the global pandemic. You will be asked to make several hypothetical decisions on survey tasks and we ask you to be as honest as possible in your responses. Anyone who is at least 18 years old, English speaking, and a resident of the United States is welcome to take part. This comprehensive survey is anticipated to take between 20 and 40 minutes to complete. One out of every 25 participants will be selected to win a $100 Visa card. Participants will also have the option to be considered to participate in follow-up research that will result in further compensation.  Study link: [https://rowan.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\_bqgpBPGqUuRz8KF](https://rowan.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_bqgpBPGqUuRz8KF)  Disclaimer: This study is approved by the Rowan University Institutional Review Board , Pro2020001076. Participation is voluntary and can be stopped at any moment. Participation is VOLUNTARY and responses are ANONYMOUS. At the conclusion of the study, you will be redirected to an external website to enter your email address if you are interested in follow-up opportunities. No personal information can be connected to survey responses and all data is stored according to the data storage protocols of Rowan University. Any questions regarding participation in the study can be directed to the principal investigator Dr. Bethany Raiff at [habit4@rowan.edu](mailto:habit4@rowan.edu). If you would like to speak to someone outside of the research team, you may call the Rowan University’s Office of Research Compliance, (856) 256-4078.  End Date: Open
I think by including a reward/pay that is a gamble, your study may select people who are inclined to take more risks.    Is there a psychological profile for people who will do work for a drawing rather than a guarantee?
Selection bias is always an important issue. We opted for this study to use the lottery style system to enable a larger, hopefully more representative sample, recruited from Reddit, as opposed to using a sample from a service which pays a small amount to every participant, like Amazon Mechanical Turk or Prolific Academic. This was done both because of the higher costs of using these services, the limitations on having a longer more comprehensive survey, and concerns that those sites are potentially less representative than a sample from Reddit. It is our hope that data from this study will add to the larger literature of the mental health effects of the pandemic which may use other recruitment methods.

School will be in person on Friday.  The spokesperson said they were asymptomatic, perhaps not realizing that peak viral shed occurs a day or so before symptoms start.    Good luck to Thales!  Hopefully this will be the last case!

This doesn’t just stop with insurers. Hospitals know they can earn much more by classifying treatments as COVID related. How much do you think being put on a ventilator cost? How much are hospitals earning for each patient? What’s the false positive rate?  Don’t think there’s a vested interest in overzealous COVID treatments that may not be entirely medically necessary? Many doctors have been speaking up about patients who deteriorated quickly by putting on ventilators when it may not have been the best option.  Follow the money folks.
BC/BS is a horrendous company, even as health ensurers go (which is an insanely low bar to begin with). They raised my parents' premium by a *significant* amount at the beginning of this year (for the same plan they already had) and now they're considering picking up additional jobs despite being in their sixties and working full-time because they both have health conditions that make insurance necessary, but the cost is too high. It's infuriating to see the working class being taken advantage of by these disgusting corporations making a profit on our desire to, y'know, not die.
Well the newspaper is bankrupt and has limited resources and if they go into hedge fund management I doubt they’ll be ANY investigative reporting in the future :/
Ventilators are rarely used anymore to treat covid-19 so your theory of treatment driven by greed and profit is bunk.
Ventilators are the only way hospitals make money off COVID? Huh ain't that interesting... TIL
