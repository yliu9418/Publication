Thanks to COVID-19, NC DMV won’t begin replacing old license plates until next year


Covid-19 Is Rampant Near Meatpacking Plants, But N.C. Won't Disclose All of the Data

Seems a little less about NC not disclosing all the data, but rather meat plants refusing to allow NC to test everyone at these plants.   It's another super tough situation, if meat plants are shut down, or reduced capacity, animals are not processed, and have to be slaughtered and discarded without being able to be used. At the same time, these plants are clearly hot beds for infection.   What's a good solution?
I was shocked to learn that a local plant was regularly having workers bussed in from as far as 3 hours away due to labor shortages. No wonder we can't keep outbreaks localized.
Remember when the guy fell in the sausage grinder and they didn't have a recall till a week later? Late 1970s if anyone wants to look it up. Thank goodness for modern DNA testing.
Some excerpts:  >Analyses of recent spikes of Covid-19 cases in more than a dozen rural counties strongly suggest links to outbreaks at meatpacking plants, yet North Carolina officials continue to ignore requests from health and worker advocates to enforce safety regulations at plants and disclose information about industry clusters to the public. Such secrecy not only endangers workers at the plants but also risks further community spread in rural areas.  >To health and worker advocates in North Carolina, the state’s refusal to release data on outbreaks is suspicious.  >“I believe they are just protecting the plants,” says Ilana Dubester, executive director of Hispanic Liaison in Siler City, who reports that workers at the Mountaire plant say family members are getting sick. “One woman worker at Mountaire had a disabled husband who never left the house. He got the virus first and had to be hospitalized, and then she got it. Since he was housebound, he only could have gotten it from her.

Revealed: Covid-19 outbreaks at meat-processing plants in US being kept quiet - Testing has found positive cases at North Carolina facilities, but officials refuse to release the information

I'm honestly not surprised. Capitalism gonna capitalism who cares if they endanger their staff and their families.../s
People keep talking about meat packing plants. Whats yalls obsession with prostitution?

Surveys: N.C. residents favor masks, worry about COVID-19, support Biden over Trump

"In all but one of the North Carolina surveys of both the presidential and senate races, no candidate received more than 50% of the support. Most results were within the surveys’ margins of error."
From Swansboro to Jacksonville to Richlands, I see the majority of people not wearing masks
the sheer amount of people who still dont wear masks in my area has determined that this is a lie
Went to Goodberrys yesterday, heard a guy talking about how proud he was to join the anti mask Raleigh page on Facebook. Wtf is that
I did not see mention of where the survey respondents were from.  If they were Wake/Meck. that would skew one way, if they were from areas like Alexander County, that would skew the other way.  This may give a hint though:  >This survey was conducted in partnership with the The Charlotte Observer, The Durham Herald-Sun and The News & Observer news outlets.   So if they were using readers or subscribers from these papers, all from the most [liberal areas of the state](https://www.politico.com/2016-election/results/map/president/north-carolina/), that would skew.
Good  Now if you mean it. Re-elect governor Cooper. His opponent is a staunch Covid Hoaxer
In the major cities, maybe. Go to a small/normal sized town and the opposite seems to be true.
Vote.
That's nice, but this is a swing state and it sounds like things here are still up in the air.  Which is very disappointing to me. We should be solidly blue, but we still have so many ignorant people sipping from the fox news juice box.
At this point start rolling back restrictions. Start with restaurants who have bars. This will put them at equal footing with bars themselves and offer curb side pickup for drinks (did this pass the house/senate yet)?  I’d like to congratulate those who wore masks at Publix, Trader Joe’s, and Wegmans. Harris Teeter lost my business as maybe 25% had them on with no enforcement.
Vote.
I never see people wear masks. Around my area a lot of people are refusing to wear them because "I'm a Christian, we don't hide our faces like the Muslims"
Everyone in Wilmington seems to be wearing masks.
You know where i see the highest compliance? Thrift stores. Those folks-staff and patrons—are really taking things seriously.
The Thom Tillis ads on youtube are so incredibly irritating. Thom Tillis is human garbage.
Was at lake Gaston for the 4th, the number of trump flags on boats and houses was disheartening
I was at multiple NC beaches over the weekend, and didn't see a single mask until I ate at a restaurant. It's almost as if polls are designed to influence public opinion rather than reflect it.
This makes me glad to live in the triangle, couple of blue islands in a Red Sea
I'd love to see surveys like this exclude Raleigh and Charlotte. Things change dramatically once you leave or approach the edges of Meck county ...
Yes! I don't live in a dumbfuck state! Huzzah! Hopefully every state is like this, but I doubt it!
Well that’s encouraging
This just in: Survey shows surveys are skewed to suit the media outlets narrative.
From where I'm at, they worry about their First Amendment rights, rather COVID. As for masks? Same, because several county's LEO were refusing masks as a protest.
Is it really a surprise the majority has common sense? The only reason the idiots make headlines is because it generates profit  for the social platforms, news media, and networks. If they stopped giving them a platform it would become clear how few share their ignorant mindset.
Surveys are not intended to reflect public opinion, they are intended to shape public opinion.
Cooper is a weak fool!!!
1410 people wouldn't give an accurate count whether or not people prefer hot dogs over hamburgers.
Thank fucking god
Yup, yup and yup.
How long are people still going to look at polls?
I bet on those election polls they didn’t list the other people running.
Guess everybody on Badin (read: Hatin') Lake this weekend hasn't got the memo yet.
Ill believe it when I see more masks and trump out of office.
Would much rather have Kanye then biden
I mean...they said Hilary was going to win in 2016 so I'll pass on the "surveys" results
No one asked me any of these questions, wtf.
The death of freedom will be met with thunderous applause.
Please don't vote Biden OR trump they are both racist rapists in cognitive decline with a "for the rich by the rich" government mentality.
Yeah im sure these surveys are only being conducted in the big citys go outside of citys and your in trump world.
I dont believe this at all unless they only surveyed people in like Greensboro. They amount of Trump 2020 flags and bumper stickers in my area is alot and i work a big tourism spot. All the locals who come through hardly any of them wear mask it's all the people out of state who wear them the most. Id say this survey is probably #fakenews
This is just not true, they’re polling the fucking triangle and that’s it, or all the fucking homeless in asheville.
Yes, and it seems no one learned from the last presidential election.
Same. Wilmington was a whole other world, though. Almost everyone I saw Friday had one on.
I'm in Alamance County and I've been to local restaurants where no worker was wearing a mask.
Hi neighbor. Same here. Doesn't really surprise me for the area though
Last time I checked jacksonville had masks on
I live in a county where the sheriffs office will not enforce the mask mandate.  So I wonder about this survey myself.
In my experience, the more essential a public location, the more likely people will be wearing masks. Everybody wore masks at the pharmacy, almost all at the grocery store, most at a gas station, 50/50 getting takeout, few at a bottle shop.  You're going to run into that 27% when you go into public. They're not limiting their public outings. Honestly, a lot of them are probably going out more now than they did at this time last year.  The rest of us are mostly limiting our public exposure. So, you won't see us as much when you're out and about.
Idk. The amount of people wearing masks in my area has boosted significantly. I only see 3 or 4 groups without masks, where before it was the other way around.
I went to the Raleigh farmers market on Saturday. Signs everywhere for social distancing and recommendations for a mask. I was at a stand getting produce, paying for my produce and this old lady not wearing a mask literally bumped into me. Like she couldn't wait for me to be done to look at peaches.   While I doubt I catch it from this one incident it's just crazy to me how blatantly these people, it seems to be mostly old people who do not care about the recommendations. And they're the highest at risk!
I work at a hotel and I would say that maybe only 10% of our guests are actually wearing masks. And at least 50% of our guests want to come up to the desk (without a mask on) to make their opinion known on the subject.   I'm beyond tired of having to listen politely to the Facebook quotes being thrown at me daily.
This study is probably true to it's data, but Republicans are a lot less likely to answer polls so the data always has a large margin of error.
You're also getting a somewhat tilted sample - many people are staying home where they can, too. Unless you live in one of those places where getting sick is "for freedom."
Same
That’s a bald-faced truth!
It was not newspaper subscribers. You can see the whole release with methodology here: [https://www.elon.edu/u/elon-poll/wp-content/uploads/sites/819/2020/07/elon-poll-june-covid-final.pdf](https://www.elon.edu/u/elon-poll/wp-content/uploads/sites/819/2020/07/elon-poll-june-covid-final.pdf)  Apparently they used a company called [Lucid LLC](https://luc.id/) to compile their survey respondents and the data was also weighted to match NC's population.  Edit: Elon also gets an A/B rating from FiveThirtyEight [https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/pollster-ratings/](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/pollster-ratings/)
It’s not like the pollsters would be unaware of that. Working in conjunction with newspapers doesn’t mean only polling subscribers.
There’s the answer to my question. Thanks!
I saw  what was labeled as a national poll and NC was grey, or up in the air. It’s for grabs either way.
Let’s not forget the unconstitutional gerrymandering we’ve had for years and years!
> people disagree with me politically and are therefore ignorant
You just want a CHAZ in Charlotte.
Restaurants with bars have been open for months though. Or do you mean they should be restricted again?
That is literally the stupidest reason yet. Congratulations! Those people are dumber than rocks.
Damn, way to work in some casual racism, folks.
Same at Lake Waccamaw. That's how you know it's a cult. People didn't fly George W. Bush flags.
It was the same on Lake Norman in Lincoln County. The trumpers on the boats were all so loud and rowdy too. Lots of woos and yee-haws. 🙄
Same at High Rock lake and also Lookout Shoals lake.  Gigantic "Trump 2020" flags everywhere.  They got a little mad when I flipped them off.
People that wear masks are unlikely to go to a sit down restaurant. I'm certainly not.
But you went out to multiple beaches and ate at a sit down restaurant. That automatically self selects for a group that doesn't think those are risky activities, while those of us who are taking this very seriously haven't been to a sit down restaurant or holiday-busy-beach since 2019. Polls are polls and have known flaws, but your anecdote alone doesn't do anything to refute them.
Shocker!
> It's almost as if polls are designed to influence public opinion rather that reflect it.  Almost all these polls are just media attempts at gaslighting.
I'm not sure how much utility there is in excluding 45% of the state's population.

Congratulations!  It looks like you’re one of today’s 10,000.  You can learn about statistical sampling [here](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)).    If you’re not interested in reading then you might be interested to know that [you only need 385 people to develop a reliable, statistically accurate, sample for a population of 100 million](https://iqsresearch.com/what-makes-a-statistically-valid-sample/).  So 1,410 is more than enough.
You obviously have never taken a statistics class in your life.
How many do you think you would need and how did you arrive at that number?
hehe narrative go brrrr
Polls are still very useful if you also consider the margin of error.
They are actually quite close to accurate. Even in 2016. Its a commom fallacy that polls were way off. They werent. Most had Hillary by 2-3% in national polls, she won that by 2%. There were some late swings in a couple states that werent polled in the days before the election, but 70,000 voters in 3 states is the reasom Trump won the EC. The polls werent that off. If you know the good ones with a large enough sample size, they are pretty close to reliable.
Probably while they remain one of the only semi-reliable ways to measure the opinions of large numbers of people instead of wild-ass guessing.
First Lady Kim Kardashian?
Biden has to obey his puppeteers since he has dementia and can’t think for himself.  Kanye changes his opinion on things every day, is addicted to drugs, and doesn’t like authority  Tough choice
I’ll bite. Loss of what freedom? The freedom not to wear a mask?
What does this mean?
You must have a skewed version of what "left" means
Everyone I come across in real life is a Trump supporter. But they are all very right. I hear the “democrat pussies” mumbo jumbo every day in the break room at work. They really seem to hate Roy Cooper too. They have been grilling him bad over the mask order. I just don’t understand the anger these people have...   I hope there really are some Biden supporters out here because I have only seen them on Reddit
I'd be very surprised if that were the case, because that would be a pretty serious pocket of outliers. What makes you say they're left-leaning?
Putting faith in your beliefs instead of scientific methodology is part of why we're in this mess
This is a silly thing to say when you can look at the methodology (and find assessments of it)
People didn't turn out to vote because they thought Trump would surely lose. Now that we've had to put up with him for this term I'm in the belief that they will turn out in droves this time in order to send a collective message and get him the hell out.
Bingo -- the polls were all wrong in the last election too.  95% clinton win!   That was a goldmine of comedy.
Even in Wilmington Walmart it felt like 80%+ had them on. The nicer stores are all closer to 100%. Glad I'm not the only one that noticed.
I don't live in Alamance but I've spent some time there recently.  Mask usage is appallingly low.
Yeah, I see a lot of masks in Jville. Way more than I was expecting. Like 90+% in every store.
Sampson or Duplin? It’s painful isn’t it? And the businesses don’t follow regulations, everyone out partying... they had a community cook out at a park about a month ago. It’s insane.
Target drive up, curbside Michael's and hardware stores, and Amazon prime have been my jam this whole time. Turns out that's what's essential for me. I did a few weeks of grocery delivery, going to the farmers market outdoor (I'm in the triad so the big state one), and then I just started using Lidl in the off hours because they're clean and it's empty. Lowe's foods has been on top of cleaning and masking for my area, Harris teeter has not (before the mask mandate, back when the CDC said they'd help).   I'd love to go into Marshalls or tj maxx though. I'll probably go to Costco in a few months when I run out of the toilet paper and paper towels I got at the beginning of March before shutdown, because I'd just run out anyway, but aside from standing in a line I'm not really worried about there.
The statistics around social distancing are essentially generating their own sampling error.
Nice username. I noticed that too, that the people that seem to care the least are older.
they are the most likely to watch/listen to bullshit right wing news.
The thing is that most people who are taking this seriously aren't even close to thinking hotels are a good idea unless absolutely necessary. It seems pretty likely that people who think it's ok to go to hotels would overlap significantly with people who think wearing a mask is overblown. That really sucks for you though. Stay safe. I have a friend who works for a hotel in Texas and was exposed by a co-worker. He just wrapped up his mandated quarantine without issue, but he's basically just biding his time until the next exposure. Shit is cray.
Can confirm.  Am at home.  Will stay here forever if the nutjobs don't wise up or die off.
Good, this is the kind of info that should have been linked to in the article.  Looking at it, I would want someone knowledgeable in survey methods to evaluate it, especially since that docs links even further to more info, and gets deeper than my skills are good for.  That's a lot to expect a reader to search through to understand or determine validity.
Former Elon student - they used to have the students cold call a randomly-generated list of numbers to get responses. This was before spam calling was so prevalent, and even then the majority of the calls went to answering machines/voicemail.  And then many people who answered didn't refuse the survey so much as say they didn't have 15-20 minutes to talk. Idk if this is how it's done/how most of the calls go now though.
True. One would hope. But biased surveys, whether deliberately or unconsciously, are nothing new.   But sources and methodology still are not listed in the article, so we have no way to tell.
yeah that just means the paper paid for the poll
This has no effect on national elections.
Don't forget how funding for education in NC has been poor. We rank pretty low on education among other states. Which leans into that concern noted earlier.
It's not really causal anymore. My uncle joked a few days ago that "I love black people so much I think everyone should own a couple"  This place is rough
Some flags say TRUMP FOREVER. Hol’ up?! Presidents only get two terms typically... is this a for real attempt to change the government into totalitarianism or what???
This is dumb. You saw a lot of bumper stickers though didn’t you, from either side? So the form of advertisement has switched from bumper stickers to flags, so what? That means they’re a cult...?
Neither am I. Driving around Asheville yesterday it was very clear from all the overflowing parking lots that many people don’t feel the same though.
Mecklenburg has a population of 1.1 mil. Wake has 1.1 mil. The state population is 10.5 mil. That’s just over 20% of the state population in those two areas, so it’s probably pretty significant to know what the remaining 80% of the state is thinking.
Ha that's true. If you're looking for the appearance of compliance, you're most likely to find it there while the vast area outside will not be wearing masks.
This is day 1 stuff in every single statistics class.  I don’t understand how people can make such confident statements on something they clearly don’t know anything about.
Doesn't this assume basically perfect sampling without stratification?
Sure did, made an A.
I didn't "arrive" at that number.  It's how many people they surveyed and is listed in the article.  As stated in other posts, the location of the survey would have a huge impact on the percentages.  Just another "news" organization doing their best to direct their agenda.  They all do it and for most thinking adults, "news" shows have become nothing more than purveyors of political agendas.
Since it seems the guy tricked you, 1410 people is more than enough. The rule of thumb in statistics is 30. 1410 would give you a very good representation of the general population.
lol
I wouldn't call them semi-reliable anymore.
Kanye is only trying to take votes from Biden so trump can win.
"Anyone not 100% for guns and pro-life = left"
I only know one person planning to vote for Trump and he's probably going to change his mind
"Supporter" is a strong word, but I'll be a Biden voter.
Idk. I’m worried about the debates.. if Joe keeps having Gaffs, forgetting words, and saying things people will flip..
Those polls tended to place Clinton at a 3 point lead, which was accurate. She *did* win the election. It was 70k people in 3 states that flipped the electoral college. Not to say that I don't still worry he could eek out a victory.
Wilmington grocery stores are a lot better now than in previous weeks. However, if you drive down front street on a sunny Saturday afternoon you'll see a couple hundred people with no mask in sight.
Yeah, the people in Wilmington seem to be doing a really good job, compared to other areas I’ve seen in NC.
Jville is unique from it's surrounding areas because the military bases bring people from all over the US and (when there are joint training operations) all over the world.
Alamance co. sheriff is doing the same. Sheriff has been trying to keep the racetrack open and refuses to issue any citations.
Iredell
Triad? State farmers market is in the Triangle (Raleigh), no?
Yeah take that, stupid old people.
That's very true! I just want me and my coworkers to be healthy. We're lucky to be working, but I wish others would respect the mandate and our health as well.
Considering there's an IFR of well under 0.1% for almost all folks under 60 it's not likely that you'll get your wish that all the nutjobs die so you can leave your house.
Five thirty eight is pretty knowledgeable about polls, if you want more validation, they are a good place to check.
According to the doc it was an online survey.
good ol' student labor, cheaper than a robodialer
You could email the author with your question.
Yes it does. It directly affects the federal elections because it re-organizes the district points to lean toward republicans.  Here are some resources  [https://www.denverpost.com/2017/06/25/gerrymandering-2016-election/](https://www.denverpost.com/2017/06/25/gerrymandering-2016-election/)    [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrymandering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrymandering)
This comment is a troll, right?
Goddamn. Heritage not hate, right? /s  Sorry, bud.
 The democrat party is the party of slavery.    The democrat party is the party of the KKK.  The democrat party is the party that voted against Civil Rights.  The democrat party is the party of Jim Crow.  If folks would bother to learn some history they would learn how to route racism out of our great state!
I’ve noticed that the worse he gets, the more flags and signs I see in yards. It’s insane.
I've noticed a lot of people joking about establishing a Trump dynasty with the Trump children. Every 8 years we'd get a new Trump.  It's a "joke" to troll the libs of course. However, I think there's a sincere desire in a lot of Americans to abandon Democracy for a monarchy, as long as they like the monarch.
I'm guessing you're a member of the cult.
My math is based on Charlotte's NC metro area being 2,636,883 and the Triangle's metro area being 2,079,687.  And I take exception to it because I'm tired of people suggesting people in cities aren't real citizens and their opinions should be discounted. It happens all the time and it's gross.
If I remember my statistics class correctly, the absolute bare minimum number you can accurately sample with is 30, but it takes a crap ton of work on the front end to make sure the sample is accurately representing the population in question.
You must be new to Reddit
63 million Trump voters would like a word with you. Sampling is not all of the story, ever.  PS, there are millions of Covid "experts" on social media that make confident statements they know nothing about. Like why deaths are trending down while cases are going up.
Yes, and u/thoughtsome thinks that's "day 1 statistics".
If that is true you should know the central limit theorem states that it only needs to be greater than or equal to 30 to be considered “normal” and this representative of the population as a whole. And if I am doing my math correctly 1410 > 30. The results from this survey are actually probably fairly accurate depending on if they were random and independent because there were so many people surveyed.
You said the number was insufficient to draw their conclusion. My question was what number would be sufficient to draw that conclusion, and how you determine that number.
>They all do it and for most "thinking" "adults", news shows have become nothing more than purveyors of political agendas.  Fixed your quotations for you
Of a perfectly uniform population. OMG the number of people here that think they know but they do not.
Literally, the reason they do them is so it's not just a bunch of people doing the thing you're doing here.
> I’m worried about the debates..  Hillary won the debates in 2016, and nobody gave a crap  -Third Party voters (Clinton and Trump are the same!) and stay-at-homers already made up their mind at that point. Good thing that Green Party and Libertarians won't be a factor this time around in 2020
If you’re worried about how Biden speaks then you’ve probably never heard Trump speak.
Joe having gaffs? Have you listened to Trump slur his words or have difficulty finishing his thoughts?  I've seen that sort of thing before, from my mom before she was diagnosed with Alzheimer's.
You must be kidding, right? Trump has the vocabulary of a 4 year old.
It's almost like you don't understand how representative democracy works.  *Eek*?
I was at Caprice Bistro a couple nights ago and some old man was being a total jackass about masks. He kept pretending he couldn’t hear their waitress unless she pulled her mask down. She... very patiently... kept hopping back a few feet to pull her mask down and repeat, to which he’d raise his hands and go “THANK YOUUUU” with a big shit-eating grin on his face. His whole family thought the routine was hilarious, but I was about ready to smack him.  Not sure if that was worse or our waiter who just never wore his mask. Always had it on his neck, never in front of his mouth. Lovely.
I actually intentionally waited to cross the line out of Alamance County this weekend to buy something because I stopped for gas and literally no person I saw at the store was taking the slightest precaution.  I know a lot of people are doing right, but none of them were there at the moment.
Terry Johnson is a uniquely terrible and racist person.  The vast majority of “kind” folk Alamance county that re-elect him year after year should be ashamed of themselves.  Unfortunately they are not.
And Craven. To my knowledge Craven's sheriff straight up said he isn't gonna have his deputies enforce it whereas Asa Buck said he won't enforce it on individuals but if a business was enforcing it and wanted someone removed because they refused a mask the individual could be charged with trespassing.
There are four that I know of (I don't think there's one at the coast but I could be wrong). Raleigh, Colfax (right off of 40), Charlotte (I want to say it's off of Billy Grahmn Freeway but it has been over a decade since I've been), and Asheville. There's a Moose Cafe in Asheville and Colfax. Edit-you're correct Raleigh= Triangle (with Durham and Chapel Hill). Triad= Greensboro, Winston Salem, High Point, Colfax is one of the smaller towns.
That's cool.  I'm comfortable here :)
Got that right!
To add to my last comment. If we didn't use a Electoral College point system and instead truly followed Democracy and went with sheer numbers of votes then the Gerrymandering wouldn't have any affect.  Which is why I believe we should go my majority voting system.
No, it's serious. State gerrymandering has been going on for decades in NC, but has zero impact on Presidential elections.
At this point it's clear that the only way Trump supporters know how to respond is by doubling down on their support. They'll follow him into the abyss.
Oh yeah a lot of people are “joking” ... ffs 🙄 the Trumps can get fucked for real lol
The Charlotte metro area extends into South Carolina. So it’s probably not the best idea to use those numbers when talking about North Carolina poll results.  And no one mentioned people in cities not being real citizens.
a t-distribution is valid with like n=20
Don't know about the 30 part, but you're right about the second part and that is what most people below are missing.
> You must be new to ~~Reddit~~ earth  FTFY
>63 million Trump voters would like a word with you. Sampling is not all of the story, ever.  A word about what? Polls were largely accurate and within their stated margins of error. Polls didn't fail in 2016. People incorrectly interpreting polls failed in 2016.
Nope, I didn't say that. Another commenter did. Pay more attention.
Your math, or logic rather, is indeed correct, 1410 >30. That's about it.  "normal" would have to assume "uniform", however. Probably what he/she means.
Nope, so long as your sampling method isn't adding bias (One common way this used to happen was polling via landlines and thus favoring older individuals), it gives you a good overview of the general population in full, not of a uniform population.  This plays into the same line of math that where if you have 23 people in the same room, there is a 50% chance at least 2 will share a birthday.  Suffice it to say, it takes a whole hell of a lot smaller sample size to get a good read on a situation than seems logical. As a result, 1410 is a very large sample size and is quite sufficient to make this sort of analysis.  As a side note, if you want to read up on the birthday thing, here's the wikipedia link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem
Tell me about it. I can poll 100,000 in the triangle and poll 100,000 people out in rural NC and get completely different results thanks to sampling bias. BuT 100,000 iS mOrE tHaN 30!!!!1!1!1!
I think James Comey made up his mind.
Words, I know them all. Short words, long words, I know the best words. Everyone knows this even if they won't admit it.
Just adding Trump's recent response to Hannity about his *truly inspiring vision* for a second term for anyone who thinks Biden doesn't speak well.   >"Well, one of the things that will be really great. You know, the word 'experience' is still good. I always say talent is more important than experience. I've always said that. But the word 'experience' is a very important word. It's an — a very important meaning. I never did this before. I never slept over in Washington. I was in Washington, I think, 17 times. All of a sudden I'm president of the United States. You know the story of riding down Pennsylvania Avenue with our first lady and I say, 'This is great,' but I didn't know very many people in Washington. It wasn't my thing. I was from Manhattan, from New York. Now I know everybody. And I have great people in the administration. You make some mistakes like, you know, an idiot like Bolton; all he wanted to do is drop bombs on everybody. You don't have to drop bombs on everybody. You don't have to kill people."  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qng0hqjV-Zs&feature=emb_logo
Amen.  At this point Biden could speak in tongues to the extent that it wakes Cthulhu from ry'leigh and even the Great Ancient himself would still vote for Joe.
/r/BeatMeToIt Yeah, Biden is no where near as lost as Trump is. And to add Trump is playing the US like a reality TV dating show trying to make sides fight one another for his amusement and it's working.  I hate that we have to go with the "status quo" for this run but it's better than going with an imbecile for another 4 years. I'd rather have a more progressive president that would work to push congress forward into the 21st century. But at least with Biden we can get someone who will actually read the daily briefings and at least act presidential and not call the other side "radicals" all the time.  Edit: I have such a low bar for entry now that Trump has been in office. I hate this.
Hahaha I'm conservative and this made me laugh. So true.
You have to be a real piece of shit to bully a server who needs to be at work to make ends meet and works for tips. Seems like the kind of person who got off on tormenting various invertebrates as a kid.  And you have to be really fucking dumb to do it before you see your food.
Asshole probably didn't even tip her.
I had an old man do that to me about a week ago. Me genuinely thinking he was hard of hearing, just spoke louder until he yelled "I can't hear you through that mask!" So, as I do when communicating with deaf people, I wrote down what I was trying to say, and slid it across the counter. After a few passes, his hearing miraculously came back.
It is very variable, but going grocery shopping is an exercise in frustration. Many are doing what they are supposed to but lots of folk just do not care. You made a good call.
Electoral college is not impacted by gerrymandering whatsoever.
Fair enough. Your original comment stated national elections, so it’s important you make that distinction. Also, not just gerrymandering, but unconstitutional gerrymandering, which is also important to distinguish.  You should definitely give the article that the other guy linked a read.
You are right about it extending into SC. That's my bad. I thought there was a separate Ft Mill-Rock Hill micropolitan area.  And I'm probably too touchy about it. I read the OP's comment as "I want to see what the real North Carolinians think" as opposed to "it would be interesting to see data on the urban/rural divide". It's a common thing in our discourse.
Read everything-- not just the part that made you angry.  I literally said, sampling isn't everything.
Yep, sorry. Jumped the gun on my phone.
Yea, which is why you poll individuals from across the state to compensate for that. Statistics isn’t just some made up pseudo-science; people have been working for hundreds of years to address and solve these problems.  It’s like people who believe the moon landing was faked, because “things naturally fall to the ground, so they can’t send a person into space.” Making that claim ignores the hundreds of years of physics and engineering that went into figuring out how gravitation works and designing a rocket which does in fact make it to the moon.   In that same way, claiming that “everyone has different beliefs, so you can’t make a poll that reflects public opinion” is similarly absurd. You can, and it’s been done, and it’s been a cumulative effort over years to figure out how best to survey populations.
That isn't an argument against sample size, though. That's against sample bias. However, that is not what the first two people were saying was wrong. They were purely discarding it based off of sample size alone, which is quite incorrect. If they wanted to argue sampling bias, why bring up the sample size at all?
"status quo" means Trump. Yes, I know. I'm being petty and semantic.
Supposedly even relatively low rates can keep the spread suppressed, so I'm hoping that we're at least meeting that level. But yeah, it is really frustrating to see people intentionally refusing to do something that could make a big difference for their neighbors. Even more so to see those same shitheads patting themselves on the back for being irresponsible shitheads like there's a damn merit badge for it.
I just given you reliable sources that say it is. Live in your bubble though. Have a good day.
Yeah I don’t pay those people any attention. There’s something interesting to be learned about poll results when you delineate between urban centers and their outlying areas. But to discount one group as not being “real” is willfully dishonest at best and my mamma didn’t raise no liar.
And I'm asking you to explain your comment. What would 63 million Trump voters like a word about? Are you implying they weren't sampled correctly?
I see in your articles about the legislative seats and gerrymandering. Where exactly in your source does it discuss the interactions between gerrymandering and the electoral college specifically?  I only ask because my understanding of it is that the electoral college has nothing to do with gerrymandering.
From the article you replied to:  " Surprisingly enough, for a population of about one million people, we would only need to survey *384* people to get a reliable answer. There are specific factors we have to consider regarding who to pick, making sure all pockets of the population are included, and the quality of the research basis, but if we can satisfy all those factors, we only have to talk to 384 people total."  It's not the equation that tells you 384, it's who you pick if attitudes are diced into pieces by race, political affiliation, age, education, blah blah blah.  That part is not day 1 statistics.  Why do I feel like you're crouching to "gotcha" me but I keep showing you things that are obvious? Are we agreeing but you're looking to prove me wrong because I said "Trump"?
It’s not hard to do some research what I’ve provided is just a small fraction of resources that go into deeper detail. If you’re looking for me to tutor you on the political system you’re in the wrong place. I got you started. Put your thinking cap on and research further if you want specific answers.   Don’t go seeking Breitbart, OAN or Infowars for info though. They’ll just feed into the conspiracy you’re trying to suggest.
At this point it's clear you think I'm someone else. I didn't say anything about day 1 statistics. Check the comment chain again.  I'm asking (and at this point I don't expect a response) what 63 million Trump voters have to do with anything.  It seems like you're implying that 2016 polling was flawed. Is that what you're implying?  Edited to add:  Moreover, you started this comment chain with a strawman argument. No one, especially not me, claimed that sampling was everything. The claim was made by another commenter that 1410 people *could not* establish a representative sample of the state. That's clearly incorrect. Is your only quibble that this isn't (**as a different commenter said**) literally day 1 of statistics class??
I guess my point is that your understanding of the political system is flawed. I don’t need you to tutor me on the political system.. my professors did that just fine.   The bottom line is that gerrymandering does affect the legislative body federally, but the electoral college system is separated from that because state votes for the presidency are aggregated.  Gerrymandering is a problem. It’s a problem at every level of the government. It is completely divorced from the electoral college system though, and both the articles you linked support that.
Yeah, I did mistake you for another commenter. Sorry.  I'm not making my arguments very skillfully, I suppose. Somewhere between surveying every voter (i.e., the actual election) and the survey results heading into the election lies the uncertainty that led to the wrong conclusion. I understand now that may have been wishful thinking in the media and not an objective interpretation of the of the survey. While being ignorant of statistical vocabulary, it is intuitively surprising that with all of the precincts/states involved, the distribution of over/underestimate would not be evenly distributed and lead to a slightly different path to the same result. I assumed that would lie in the sampling.  However, I am indeed a statistical amateur. I think this makes me qualified to say it's not "day 1 statistics". I understand what you are saying; strictly speaking , the number should be enough. I had a problem in physics, too: even though I could calculate how fast a feather fell to earth it never quite matched reality.  Ultimately, I am skeptical of a survey sponsored by newspapers using opt-in respondents and using metric that don't even sound like the ones I am used to hearing (what is credibility interval?). I presented an argument but maybe it was the wrong one.  Edit, addition: again, I realize you're not the "day 1 statistics" person. I still make that "day 1" point because that was in response to the bot's reply, and I don't think it's quite that simple due to proper sampling. Still, I understand your points.
I'm a statistical novice myself. Sorry if I came on a little strong so maybe I should explain myself.  I've seen a lot of people point to the polling of 2016 as a reason that "you can't trust polls" meaning that you can discard the result of any poll you don't like, no matter how well it was conducted. That argument is infuriating to me and I'll push back when I see it.  It seems like you weren't making that argument, so you have my apologies.
All good. We were both fired up!  The common ground is that we both choose to think about what we're told instead of taking it at face value. Our country needs more people to do that.

COVID-19 announcement Carolina Renaissance Festival

The most sensible business reaction to this situation is coming from a bunch of goof balls that play dress up. Thank you for thinking about the health of your amazing actors and guests.  (Speaking as a goof ball who has attended every year for the past 8 years)  We’ll see you next year, huzzah!
Good call, the right call!      My wife and I are big fans but would never have considered attending this year, or until we get vaccinated.
real missed opportunity not writing the announcement in anachronistic pseudo olde englishe

North Carolina begins testing for COVID-19 in private nursing homes :

Only by finding COVID-19 cases can you eliminate it. More testing has always been an answer to stopping viral spread.
Awesome, next we need to be testing every person working and associated with meat packing plants, as that's another hot spot, and the state is being told essentially to bugger off currently.
well about time..........jeez
I wonder how often they'll have to re-test?

On day Raleigh camps opened, children exposed to COVID-19

This is why as much as I would love to send my kids to camp I simply won't do it.
Schools are going to have kids out so often just as a precaution
Gasp!
I read a story on wlos.com today with a person asking if they should take their newborn out in public.  The "doctor's" reply was as long as they keep the infant 6' away from people, it's fine to take a newborn out in public.  I'm so sick of these idiots.

Positive COVID-19 cases on the decline?
Well, at first glance our trend is definitely going down, everyone should cheer and yell about the progress right? But.  Hold up a sec.Our testing over the past three days is 50% lower than the the three days prior and 25% less than the three days before that.  Yes, we had the Fourth of July, but that would mean a big test dump Monday or today.  That never happened.Are we purposely slowing down testing so that the number of confirmed positives also declines?Percent positives are still in the 10-11% range...What’s up NCDHHS?
Monday and Tuesday tend to be the lowest numbers every week, I think because there is lag from lower testing on the weekend. Looking at Monday and Tuesday as a decline would not be correct - a weekly average would be better. Hospitalizations also have continued trending up.
Is testing slowing down or are less people presenting with symptoms warranting the need to test?     In mid-June I had a a handful of acquaintances test positive.   75% were mild/ asymptomatic and tested due to possible exposure.   The remaining 25% developed severe enough complications to warrant hospitalization.   All were under 40.   All have returned home from their hospital stay and are recovering at home.   Will be interesting to see if the hospitalized individuals recover fully or have any further complications.
Where are you seeing that NC cases are declining, please?  All numbers I’ve seen still indicate a slow and steady rise.
I’d say the logic you’re using sharpens both sides of the sword. Have the number of cases gone down the past few days because testing went down or have the number of cases gone up the past few weeks because testing went up?
Availability of tests or the speed with which they are completed are likely factors.  Positive case results aren't a very good indicator of which direction we are heading because the data set is always going to be incomplete unless we test EVERYONE.  The numbers you should rely on are deaths and hospitalizations, the latter in particular.  If Hospitalizations are trending down, that means the overall case count is most likely moving down with it.  We haven't seen that in NC yet, our ICU beds are slowly but surely filling up, this is bad.  If we run out of ICU beds in the state, it's very likely the death count is going to start going up pretty quickly.  This is why, for months now, there have been calls for mask mandates and a potential return to phase 1.  Frankly, there are a lot of people in this state who cannot be trusted to make common sense decisions about public health, so those decisions are eventually going to be made by the state.
Positives last two days around 9% That said, there might be a big spike tomorrow/Thurs due to holiday weekend.  Any impacts from mask order won't be felt for another 7-10 days minimum.  (I think mask order will have minimal impact)
r/HolUp
Agree fully, the weekly trend is trending lower.  Let’s see if there’s a test dump this week.
This is the question.  My hope is that it’s the latter.
Front the NCDHHS [dashboard](https://covid19.ncdhhs.gov/dashboard)
Positive cases lead to contact tracing, contact tracing leads to understanding if we have an outbreak and where it is and how many are infected.  It’s not just a numbers game, we need to know how wide the spread is and we need to ensure those who are positive, even asymptomatically are not spreading it causing our hospitals and health care systems to be overrun by those who have serious effects from the virus.
It's likely just that there is less testing being done due to the holiday. Wait til Thursday and test numbers should be going back up.  With hospitalizations peaked, if the numbers are accurate, we will start seeing deaths increase in about 4 weeks due to the amount of time it takes to cause death and how long it takes to get reported.
Not really enough of a decline indicated there to hang your hat on. Plus, the big, bad hospitalization stat is still definitely on the rise.  That’s the truly problematic one.
Ok, but really has nothing to do with the point of my response to OP’s post. If we’re going to question new cases going down based on decreased testing, we also have to question cases going up based on increased testing.
Hospitals have not been "overrun" anywhere in the US and the death rate is currently at the threshold of the CDC definition of a "pandemic". Why are people still panicking about this?
Death rates have been down since April with increasing hospitalizations. Exactly what science are you basing your speculation on?
Yeah, it's more obviously a plateau when you look at the numbers used imo.  Date | New Cases | New Cases (7 Day Average) | New Cases (Per Capita 100k) | New Cases (Per Capita 100k - 7 Day Average) :-- | --: | --: | --: | --: 7/8/20 | 1435 | 1542.43 | 13.68 | 14.71 7/7/20 | 1346 | 1600.71 | 12.83 | 15.26 7/6/20 | 1546 | 1577.86 | 14.74 | 15.04 7/5/20 | 1329 | 1555.86 | 12.67 | 14.83 7/4/20 | 1413 | 1595.29 | 13.47 | 15.21 7/3/20 | 2099 | 1639.00 | 20.01 | 15.63 7/2/20 | 1629 | 1572.71 | 15.53 | 15.00 7/1/20 | 1843 | 1484.14 | 17.57 | 14.15 6/30/20 | 1186 | 1466.71 | 11.31 | 13.98 6/29/20 | 1392 | 1418.43 | 13.27 | 13.52 6/28/20 | 1605 | 1334.43 | 15.30 | 12.72 6/27/20 | 1719 | 1306.86 | 16.39 | 12.46 6/26/20 | 1635 | 1282.57 | 15.59 | 12.23 6/25/20 | 1009 | 1285.00 | 9.62 | 12.25
> lus, the big, bad hospitalization stat is still definitely on the rise. That’s the truly problematic one.  From Jeff Jackson:  https://old.reddit.com/r/bullcity/comments/hdqz7q/update_heres_the_situation_with_covid_in_nc_sen/  >I should note that there’s a question about this data. Now that people are going back to hospitals for routine procedures, they’re all being tested when they arrive. And some of those folks are testing positive. So now they're in the hospital with COVID. And it’s unclear to what extent they’re being included in this hospitalization number. In short, we need to make sure we are measuring people who are hospitalized for COVID, not with COVID. But it's unclear to what extent that explains this increase, if at all.
Both Texas and Florida's hospitals are being overrun as we speak.
Although I disagree with "anywhere in the US," I think our hospitals in NC are doing their best. A higher percentage of ICU beds are available now then were available last month. Let's try to continue to keep them available for anyone who needs it.   Just a clarification about the CDC definition of a pandemic: what does the death rate have to be to be a pandemic according the CDC? I didn't know 130,000 out of 3 million wasn't enough. Could you link that definition?
[In Arizona, COVID-19 patients in Tucson are being sent to Phoenix because there aren't enough ICU beds for them.](https://kvoa.com/news/2020/07/05/staffed-icu-beds-are-dangerously-low-tucson-patients-being-sent-to-phoenix/)

COVID-19 NC Numbers
&#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/j9r8pgrc9da51.jpg?width=1355&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a05d9f99b4d02655e639a660db706b2e19279d26
Average 7 days daily fatalities approx. 12, seems to be under control, for now?
Someone tell me there’s an end in sight.  This is so depressing.
There seems to be a tendency with some of these COVID numbers posts to ignore the data except for any data the confirms a predetermined message. NC DHHS reports: NCDHHS reported the state’s *highest one-day number of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases with 2,462 reported*. It is the *highest one-day increase to date*. Hospitalizations are also at *a record high with 1,093 people currently hospitalized* with COVID-19. Read the press release and learn more about North Carolina’s strategy to combat COVID-19.  Harvard Global Health Institute reports that Mecklenburg, Hyde, Duplin and Tyrrell counties are considered to be at COVID Risk level "Red," and are in need of stay-at-home orders to curb the spread of the virus.  This is a life and death matter for people. All the numbers are at worse ever levels for everything except for the deaths. So if you want to come here saying, "Average 7 days daily fatalities approx. 12, seems to be under control, for now?", I think we deserve to know your qualifications. Are we getting better at treatment? Or is it that more young people are getting infected? I don't know. And if you are only looking at the same data that I'm looking at, you don't know either.   Take a look at Arizona. Their fatalities seemed to be totally under control too...and then they exploded.
It is probably due to the fact that the increase in cases is from younger people, which would not represent any better control as far as expected health outcomes.
Just because you don't die doesn't mean there are not side effects that make your life hell afterwards.
[https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/science/coronavirus-vaccine-tracker.html](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/science/coronavirus-vaccine-tracker.html)  Four vaccine candidates are in phase III trials. All produced neutralizing antibodies and passed the phase I and II safety trials. Keep hope.
Good points. Just fyi, i took the data from [data.world](https://data.world), and visualized it using a software called Tableau. The [data.world](https://data.world) covid data is sourced from NYT daily tracker. The 7 days average also calculated using Tableau. Analysis is of course, NC only... because I migrated to the triangle area back in 2017 and now live here :)  You are right, this might be a prelude to what's coming, and we may very well become Arizona. I shall look into Arizona's numbers later on.
47 new deaths today per NC officials.    https://www.newsobserver.com/news/coronavirus/article244173167.html  Deaths are a lagging factor by up to 6 weeks. They are now starting to climb which makes sense, and hopefully won't climb as much as they were at their peak.
I'm not disagreeing with your data or even your statement. I would just caution on talking up the one single positive data point while everything else looks much worse.   You have health agencies and epidemiologists that are recommending that some NC counties should shut down again. Then you suggest that the pandemic is under control. Those two statements are counter to each other. If you are making a health recommendation counter to those agencies, I personally think you should post your qualifications.
Blocked by paywall.
> You have health agencies and epidemiologists that are recommending that some NC counties should shut down again.  Are these the counties with significant meat packing operations?  https://indyweek.com/news/northcarolina/covid-19-meatpacking-plants/  >The data show new or ongoing surges of infections in 14 rural counties with significant meatpacking operations, including Sampson, Wayne, Bladen, and Duplin Counties—the state leaders for pork production, which together employ 19,000 workers. **Twelve counties with surges are also ranked among the highest in the nation for Covid-19 cases**. In addition to the four above, they include Burke, Chatham, Randolph, Johnston, Robeson, Rowan, Sampson, and Union Counties. Two others with smaller caseloads but new spikes are Surry and Wilson Counties.  -If so, I'm not sure how "shutting down" would help those counties, since meat plants are essential industries
try this:  [https://www.newsobserver.com/news/coronavirus/article244160742.html](https://www.newsobserver.com/news/coronavirus/article244160742.html)   It's saturday's numbers. It's not shown up yet on [data.world](https://data.world) tracker. It is indeed highest deaths recorded in a single day, previous one being 38.  Very concerning.
To my knowledge, Mecklenburg, Hyde, and Tyrrell don't have any meat packing plants. However, Duplin has several large processing centers.

New record set for COVID-19 hospitalizations, single-day deaths in North Carolina

Great time to start talking about schools opening up.
Looks like those masks are really working
Are you this negative in real life?
https://www.newsobserver.com/news/coronavirus/article244213097.html
Only work when people use them, keeping it under your nose or around your neck like 80% of people I've seen isn't "using a mask".
Hospitalizations take 2-4 weeks and deaths take 4-8 weeks so these numbers are from people infected pre these orders.   Also, people are still not complying so until people do these numbers will continue to go up
Unfortunately it takes time from the order put in place and compliance to occur for cases to go down. Additionally, masks could be working and we don't know how many additional cases we would be seeing.   You are making the same argument that someone who doesn't think we should of locked down because so many people died. Not exactly the correct approach.
Looks like that reopening is really working
Maybe they would if people wore them. Most places around the state don’t care to enforce the mandate. My entire county already said they wouldn’t the day it was announced. I’ve seen maybe 50% compliance.
They don't work when you don't wear them.
This is honestly probably due to all the protests about a month ago.
Ah the mythical ‘it’s better than what would’ve been’ when there are several other countries that show the lockdown didn’t really help.  Guess ping me in X number of weeks when it starts working. Yay, another moving goalpost.
As someone who was at some of the protests, I saw way more people wearing masks there than I do at my local Walmart, by far.
Yeah.  Wrong.  I was at almost every protest in Raleigh and have been at a few in Durham.  Almost every person was wearing masks.  This was before the mask order.  Yet at my local HT, every third person is maskless.  I have kept in touch with many people from the protests and we planned our own ad hoc contact tracing just in case.  No one has called me to say they were positive.
You’re not allowed to say that tho
Which ones? The EU seems to be doing far better than the US literally in all measures.   I don't think you actually know what moving the goalposts means. Trolling about a pandemic that costs people their lives seems like a pretty ignorant and childish thing to do.
I was also at the protests in Raleigh during different days and I’d say only about 50% of everyone was wearing a mask. A much lower percentage than what I would see going into Publix.  So no, not wrong.
Of course indoors is worse than outdoors. But that’s not what I’m claiming. I was at the protests. There were hundreds and hundreds of people without masks within inches of each other. That would absolutely be cause for concern, just like being indoors without a mask is.
[wrong.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/tommybeer/2020/07/01/research-determines-protests-did-not-cause-spike-in-coronavirus-cases/#753f19f37dac)
Yeah. No.   I read that study. That study was published in June. The protests were primarily in June. How in the hell was this study able to conclude that the protests had no effect on the infection rate when many times in takes 14+ days to even start feeling symptoms. It’s very likely that people infected at the protests are just now starting to get sick.   Try again my dude.
I’m complaining about both protests. All I said was “protests a month ago” which would encompass both reopenNC and the George Floyd protests. The reality is Covid don’t give a shit what the cause is and all of them are idiots, including me who was at the GF protest.   You’re a douche bag who assumes I am leaning on one side of the argument just because I think protests are a big cause of spreading.   My problem is that most of reddit, including you, likes to cherry pick what human activities should or should not be tagged as being irresponsible with the virus. It doesn’t work like that.
Ok, how’s [this](https://www.healthline.com/health-news/black-lives-matter-protests-didnt-contribute-to-covid19-surge)  What’s the narrative you’re trying to push here?  People marching to solve systemic inequalities are as bad as the “but mah freedom” maskless crowd?
I mean a different article stating the same exact opinion isn’t going to be any different?   And yes. They are just as bad as the redneck mask-less crowd. They’re a huge reason why our numbers are what they are. I’m not saying people shouldn’t of protested but don’t be an idiot and look the other way at one crowd and not the other. Need to hold both responsible.
Well I think everyone thinks bars are worse than protests when it comes to risk???   But crowded protests are absolutely worse than going into a supermarket without a mask.   Like you said, it’s all about risk analysis. :)
Actually the reopen people have been protesting since April and didn't contribute to an uptick (it doesn't seem but i'm no scientist).   Speaking of....PM you always knock people about 'not knowing much' about science/risk/etc. What are your qualifications outside of the armchair you're sitting in? Just saying 'you dont understand' is a cop-out and insulting, and is really the problem with this whole situation...ie that for every 'expert' that makes a claim, there is another expert (and possibly the same one contradicting themselves later) that claims the opposite. What 'data' CAN be trusted at this point? Which is going to be a bigger problem the next  time this happens. MORE people will die because out of all of this it is very evident that some people will politicize the crisis.
Since you didn’t read the article, here’s the quote:  >	“I have not seen any peer-reviewed research linking outdoor protests (or really any major outdoor events) to the surge here in Texas,” said Rodney Rohde, PhD, an associate dean for research at Texas State’s College of Health Professions who focuses on public health microbiology.”  There are facts and evidence that say reopening too early is the cause for this surge.
“I haven’t see anything so it much not be true”   Please, share a link with me that proves re-opening early is the ONLY reason why we are currently spiking.   Once again I’m not saying that the protests are the only reason for it. It’s not. But it’s absolutely an big contributor. Not sure why you are defending the protesters this much.
Not looking for an argument at all. Just pointing out that making statements that allude to you being smarter/more researched than others, in this and other threads, automatically puts people on defensive and ready to fight/defend. You clearly have firsthand experience in several areas relating to all of this as you described, and that is valuable input where appropriate. I'm sure we'll bump into one another again. Best.

Covid-19 testing in Charlotte/Huntersville/Salisbury recommendations?
HiIs anyone familiar with testing in these areas?I’m flying in from California to care for my elderly dad recovering from surgery. I am hoping to find testing that is:* Fast results* Free or paid by my insurance* ConvenientI’ve found some info on the NCDHHS website with locations, but the information seems vague. I’m a little spoiled living in San Francisco where testing is abundantly available and fast and free.I’m hoping that some friendly NC redditors can offer insight!
I know multiple people who have gotten tested recently, there is no such thing as fast results right now.  Fastmed will test you next day but results are a week out.  The hospital system will test you, it used to be fast but right now it's like a 6/7 day wait. The results are faster.   It's not that it's not available it's just that so many people are sick that capacity is overloaded.
I thought i should mention my experience. I called Rowan County Health Dept and explained my situation, and they made me an appointment. They have testing on some kind of rotating schedule. It was free and the test result was available in 30 minutes. I asked about the accuracy and they said about 85%. This is far lower than the tests I’ve had in San Francisco, but that’s not so say it’s bad. The recommendation was to go with the test result and come back for another test if you find yourself having symptoms. This seemed logical to me.

Charlotte, some towns plan to ban late-night alcohol sales to slow spread of COVID-19

Looks like Charlotte and some of the other cities in Mecklenburg county will be following Orange Counties lead in limiting alcohol sales. Makes sense, as I doubt most restaurants are selling all that much 'food' past 10pm anyways.  If you get paywalled: https://outline.com/AFJzAc
Oof. This is really going to affect bars and restaurants’ sales even more. I understand why they’re doing this but how is this keeping the economy in balance? Don’t they make most their money at that time? What if employees get laid off? Federal Unemployment is leaving soon and it’s unlikely you’ll get the max for state.
Reddit is the only site on the web that gives me hope for NC ..
When does this go into effect?
> This is really going to affect bars and restaurants’ sales even more.  Even more? Are you kidding? 15% of the bars in NC are still closed, so that would be ZERO sales. 85% of the businesses with alcohol permits are wide open.  > how is this keeping the economy in balance?  By getting the pandemic under control so that _all_ of the bars (and gyms, and theaters, etc.) are allowed to reopen.   I have several friends who own bars that are not legally allowed to reopen. We just entered our THIRD phase 2 extension. They are all on the verge of bankruptcy. Yet, all of these restaurants are that are basically bars and are staying open until 2am selling alcohol. They are absolutely _destroying_ all of the bars that are still legally required to be closed.  They need to shut down **all** alcohol sales at restaurants until we get this thing under control.
They're helping the economy by taking extremely minimal measures to slow the spread of a really gnarly disease.
>	how is this keeping the economy in balance?  That’s not the point. At all.
But they’re not actually taking extremely minimal measures at all. They’re trying to meet somewhere in the middle. We JUST started mandatory face coverings. Schools are going to send kids to school in rotations. Social distancing and masks are not really heavily enforced anywhere. Lots of places are open again for dine in and unemployment is ending soon so even if you feel uncomfortable going back to work, you won’t have a choice. I’m not happy staying inside but I’d rather they go full fledge and force us to stay home while providing some sort of livable income then whatever they’re doing now. So once again, how are places going to stay open with all these restrictions and no help?
They're probably not. This is the weird, probably insufficient stopgap. It's very unlikely that current plans are going to do enough. I'm genuinely worried for friends and loved ones regarding schools reopening.   In terms of businesses closing, there's been a near-total failure at the federal level to take the necessary steps to help out both people and small businesses. So far, we're getting weird, insufficient stopgap measures there, too.

Nursing homes mostly immune from COVID-19 liability due to NC relief bill

Scares the hell out of me that in a panic the first thing our legislature and governors thought was “Oh God, we have to protect the health care executives.”
The lack of liability means no duty to perform. This effectively eliminates the right to be alive if you are in there. Our country is such a worthless pile of crap.

The reality of retail life during Covid-19.

 From the other side of the paywall.  Lori Wagoner is a retail clerk trying to enforce a state requirement to wear masks. This is her story.  We tried our best to be polite about it. I’d frame it to customers like they were doing us this big favor: “Would you please consider wearing a mask?” “May we offer you a free mask?” “We sure do appreciate your cooperation.”  I’ll never understand what’s so hard about putting on a mask for a few minutes. It’s common sense. It’s a requirement now in North Carolina. But this is a conservative place, and there are only 900 people in this town. We try hard to get along. We’re a small general store, and we didn’t want to end up in one of those viral videos with people spitting or screaming about their civil rights. We put a sign outside — an appeal to kindness. “If you wear a mask, it shows how much you care about us.”  We found out how much they cared. It became clear real quick. I’m 63. I’m a lifetime asthmatic. I’d watch customers pull into the parking lot without their faces covered, and my whole body would start to tense up. Our store is on the Intracoastal Waterway, and people from all over the world dock in the harbor and come in here for supplies. It’s a big petri dish. I put a shield up over my register, and a few hours into my shift it was covered with spittle. We’d have 20 or 30 people walk by the sign and come in without a mask. I’d try to get their attention and point to the sign. It was a lot of: “You’re infringing on my rights. This is a free country, and I’m here to shop, so who’s going to stop me?”  Then the local sheriff went on Facebook and said he wasn’t going to enforce the state requirement because he didn’t want to be the “mask police.” So now what? I have customers who are breaking the law and putting my life at risk, and what am I supposed to do? I’m a freaking retail clerk. I ring up beer and boat supplies for 10 bucks an hour. I don’t want to deal with this. If I didn’t need the money, I’d be home working in my garden or visiting my grandkids. I don’t come into the store every morning looking to make some big moral stand, but when I see something that’s wrong, I can’t let it slide. I cannot shut up. I get stuck on things. That’s my biggest downfall or my biggest asset. So, fine. I’ll be your mask police. What choice do I have? I talked to my co-worker, and we decided to hang another sign on the wall.  “Thanks for wearing a mask. It’s the most patriotic thing you can do.”  That didn’t stop them, so we kept adding more. “Please be kind to us.” “We’re here for you seven days a week, and we didn’t create this situation.” “Masks are required for anyone entering the store.” Maybe some people took it as a challenge. I don’t know. But it kept on escalating. Most of our customers are supportive and respectful about it — maybe 90, 95 percent. But on weekends, we get dozens of people from Charlotte or Raleigh who come to visit their boats. Those places are virus hot spots, and they come here to have a good time and maybe they’re drinking. Some of them would see our signs, open the front door, and just yell: “F--- masks. F--- you.” Or they would walk in, refuse to wear a mask and then dump their merchandise all over the counter. I had a guy come in with no mask and a pistol on his hip and stare me down. I had a guy who took his T-shirt off and put it over his mouth so I could see his whole stomach. “There. A mask. Are you happy?” I had a lady who tried to tape a pamphlet on the front window about the ADA mask exemption, which is a totally fake thing. It’s a conspiracy theory, but it’s become popular here. She kept saying we were discriminating against people with disabilities. What? Why? How? None of what they say sounds logical. I can’t make sense of half the names they call me. They say I’m uneducated — uh, that’s kind of ironic. They say I’m a sheep. I’ve been brainwashed. I’m pushing government propaganda. I’m suffocating them. I’m a part of the deep state. I’m an agent for the World Health Organization. “How do you like your muzzle?” “Is this going to become sharia law?” “Are you prepping us to wear burqas?” “What’s next? Mind control?”  The customer’s always right. We grit our teeth and try to accommodate the customer. We offer them free masks, even though they cost about a dollar. If the mask makes them uncomfortable for whatever reason, we say they can wait outside and we will be happy to provide curbside service at no extra charge. If that somehow offends them, we apologize and suggest they shop somewhere else. Then it’s: “My rights, my rights. Why are you trampling on the Constitution?” My fists are clenched all the time now. I’m always on edge. I wish this virus were glitter so we could actually see it, because in my mind, it’s everywhere. I wear gloves to touch the merchandise. I wipe down everything. I put a table in front of my register so nobody can come closer than six feet. I sanitize my hands so much they must be drunk. We had three new positive cases on the same day in this town, but people can’t be bothered to put a piece of cloth over their face. The sheriff’s department is closed to the public because it has a bunch of positive cases, but they still won’t enforce the mask law. One day I said to my co-worker, “I need to leave the store right now or I’m going to lose it. I’m going to explode.” I ended up taking 12 days off. I had a dream that I was going around the store and physically moving people six feet apart, scolding them for not wearing a mask. I came back to work and decided I wasn’t going to take it anymore. I handed out these laminated cards that say: “Mask Exemption Override – There is no ADA exemption for mask wearing.” If a person refuses to wear a mask, I’m like: “Okay. Goodbye. Have a nice life, and thoughts and prayers if you get covid.” They’re selfish. They’re lemmings. I don’t know if the virus will kill me or if it’s going to be my rage. Sometimes I want to cut America into different pieces, and all these anti-maskers can live together, and we’ll see how it works.  A few weeks back, we put an orange traffic cone on the sidewalk out front to draw people’s attention before they come into the store. We taped up another sign. “No mask, no entry.” Is that clear enough? That seems pretty clear, right? But this big, burly guy walked past the cone and past all the signs, and he pushed the door open. I said, “Sir, can I help you?” I pointed to the signs. I pointed to my mask. He was probably in his late 30s, and I’d never seen him before. He rolled his eyes and ignored me, so I knew where it was going. I came out from behind the register to try to block his path into the store. I said: “Do you have a mask you can put on?” He shook his head like he couldn’t be bothered, and he said he just wanted to buy a drink. I said, “Okay, that means I will get your drink while you wait outside and I will bring it to the door.” But he’s still moving into the store, and I’m trying to stay in front of his path and keep him from going down the aisle. He said, “Come on, lady. I just want water. I have an ADA exemption.” I said: “I’m tired of this. Just leave the store now.” He kept moving toward me, yelling, “ADA exemption, ADA exemption,” and now my body was starting to shake. It was fear and so much anger. Why is this my problem to deal with? This maskhole? This covidiot whose stupidity is putting me at risk? This isn’t what I signed up for. I’m trying to be the enforcer. I’m trying to corral this guy to the door, but he’s not backing down, and he’s getting more aggressive. He’s screaming about his rights. He’s yelling at me to call the police. We’re six inches apart. He yells out: “Social distancing! Move out of my way.” He’s screaming all kinds of profanity, and I’m screaming it back. My co-worker was yelling for him to get out, and another customer started yelling, and finally he stomped around for a while and then turned back outside.  We locked the front door and my co-worker and I went back into the storage room. We sat there and sobbed.  The next morning, I went to the hardware store to buy supplies. I can’t handle the constant tension. It’s rinse and repeat with all these daily blowups, and I’m starting to get paranoid. We installed a doorbell so we can keep the front door locked even during business hours, and I’ve got pepper spray up at my register. This is my job now. At least I’ll be ready.  About this series  Voices from the Pandemic is an oral history of covid-19 and those affected.
An extended family member of my wife's wrote this. It is a shocking read to say the least.
Very sad story. I've had that same thought the author describes near the end, just divide up America and let's quit trying to live together.
Trapped behind a paywall. Cool
Man, this really seems like it could be from somewhere near where I am in Southport.  And, her name even sounds familiar.
Of course the only journalism I've seen so far looking at retail work during the pandemic is just some more mask vs no mask bullshit. Not a single thought for all the extra labor for the worker (with no extra pay). No examination of their workplaces actual safety procedures.   IMO all this argument over masks is meant to distract from the fact that we clearly should not have reopened when we did.  I work at a retailer. They chose to reopen in May. They lied to us and said if we said we weren't ready to come back we'd lose our unemployment. That was a lie because they're only just now starting to fire people. If I'd have known, I could have stayed on unemployment until July 31st and I'd have had my regular wages PLUS $2400 EXTRA. All while sitting at home in safety.   The masks we were initially given were literally cut up squares of polyester garden flag. Unbreathable, in a store where the heat was always too high before the pandemic. I spent two weeks dizzy and lightheaded just standing at my service desk. Just rearranging pillows left me feeling like I'd fall over without support. I'm young and in relatively good health, too.   I've since acclimated to the mask (and was finally issued a better one) but it still sucks.  Our cleaning procedures amount to theater. We're told to hurry up spraying counters between customers... with a cleaner that takes 1 minute to kill viruses. We're constantly running out of paper wipes that pop out of the box and constantly have to share regular paper towel rolls between people, which is not sanitary.  We had a quarantine procedure for returns that was incredibly simple, but literally nobody at my store but me could follow it properly. I complained. The answer was that we're not going to bother quarantining returns anymore.   This company is talking about opening fitting rooms. I PROMISE YOU these will not be adequately staffed or cleaned. The plan is to quarantine items customers have tried on. Did I not literally just mention that this store couldn't keep a mindlessly simple quarantine process for returns? No, this stuff won't be quarantined either. In fact, the plan is to still keep it open for online orders, because if somebody coughs all over a shirt, then that shirt is immediately thrown in a bag and picked up 30 minutes later, it totally won't infect them, right? Yeah.   I'm pretty much resigned to the fact that I'm guaranteed to contract Covid at some point. It's just a numbers game. I take returns all day. I've had multiple customers tell me all about how they're just back from Florida. Every single day I get dozens of returns that I have to touch to process because customers give me the fucking evil eye for having the gall to ask them to put an item in a bag or take their unnecessary box home. "WELL WHAT AM I GONNA DO WITH THIS BOX" they screech.   If I weren't lied to by management about staying on furlough, if I'd gotten the federal UI assistance through the 31st, I could literally afford to be unemployed through probably December or January, and instead I'm just hoping I don't die, don't become crippled, or don't kill a loved one when I inevitably become sick.   And my complaints aren't just mine, this is the case for thousands of retail workers who are being burnt up like kindling just so their shareholders and landlords can keep making money from the safety of THEIR homes.

WaPo used to allow three free reads a month, I think.  Or you could use incognito mode.  Or just don't read it at all, because it's very depressing, will cause you to lose all faith in your fellow man, any hope that you may have of getting through this pandemic,  and make you ashamed to live in North Carolina.  I read it earlier and felt ill afterwards.
Get uBlockOrigin and apply particular filter lists and you won't run into this issue if you can't/won't pay.  It's good for your overall browsing experience/safety anyways.

(1) Interactive COVID-19 map showing recent trends per county and (2) downloadable csv files with case and death counts per day for each county starting March 24
As a public service I produce an interactive map that uses COVID-19 data from Johns Hopkins University to tell at a glance whether the number of new cases or deaths in each county is trending up or trending down.  The information for the map is updated each night.The symbols on the map summarize the recent trends as follows:* Circle		Prior 14 days* Triangle	        Prior 7 days* Green		Good - numbers are trending down* Red		Bad - numbers are trending upClick any symbol for details.Open the map and show data about new cases:[https://mappingsupport.com/p2/gissurfer.php?center=35.359579,-80.189209&zoom=7&basemap=USA\_basemap&overlay=County\_boundaries,State\_boundary,County\_recent\_COVID\_cases&txtfile=https://mappingsupport.com/p2/disaster/coronavirus/covid\_14\_day.txt](https://mappingsupport.com/p2/gissurfer.php?center=35.359579,-80.189209&zoom=7&basemap=USA_basemap&overlay=County_boundaries,State_boundary,County_recent_COVID_cases&txtfile=https://mappingsupport.com/p2/disaster/coronavirus/covid_14_day.txt)The map has a number of overlays that you can turn on/off.  You can display data about recent cases or recent deaths.  The data can be displayed by county, by state or by country.If you need help using the map, please read the **“Map tips”** (link in upper left corner).Also, I wrote code that converts the Johns Hopkins timeseries \*cumulative\* counts into **\*daily\* counts of cases and deaths for all counties**.  These daily counts begin March 24th and are in csv files that anyone can download and import into GIS or spreadsheet software.  I made a PDF with details about (1) the interactive map and (2) these csv files.Open PDF:[https://mappingsupport.com/p2/help/COVID19-new-cases-per-day.pdf](https://mappingsupport.com/p2/help/COVID19-new-cases-per-day.pdf)
That an interesting data presentation and offers some thinking material.  Wasn't it a couple of weeks ago everyone was bashing Myrtle Beach for reopening, etc,etc, but yet.. they have the strongest downward trend, wonder what that could be about?  People just not going to get tested? Staying home if they are sick?
Thank you this is great to have. What is that super hot spot south of High Point?
I believe you also shared this via the ncgis listserv? This could be really helpful for researchers like myself (with attribution, of course!). Thanks for your work on this!
Awesome. Thank you. One suggestion- on mobile the bottom of the overlay is covered up by other text and is unreadable. At least for carteret county.   Thanks for this.
One thing I have noticed is that the trend up or down can change quickly.
There's a huge huge disparity in Covid cases. The people that are getting it, are getting it from their essential jobs; not from beaches and bars.  Like meatpacking plants in NC:  https://indyweek.com/news/northcarolina/covid-19-meatpacking-plants/
It looks like they have markers for both the state and Randolph county there and they are difficult to distinguish from each other.
Oopsie!  That's my fault.  I meant to post the map link with only the county cases layer turned on.  But as pcockcock points out, I accidentally also had the state cases layer turned on.  If you click the basemap button and look under the "Overlay" heading (mobile users scroll down) then you can click that 'state' layer to turn it off.  **Edit:** I just tweaked the map link I posted so the 'state' case layer is off when the map opens.
If its like other rural areas, it could be meatpacking plants:  https://indyweek.com/news/northcarolina/covid-19-meatpacking-plants/  >The data show new or ongoing surges of infections in 14 rural counties with significant meatpacking operations, including Sampson, Wayne, Bladen, and Duplin Counties—the state leaders for pork production, which together employ 19,000 workers. Twelve counties with surges are also ranked among the highest in the nation for Covid-19 cases. In addition to the four above, they include Burke, Chatham, Randolph, Johnston, Robeson, Rowan, Sampson, and Union Counties. Two others with smaller caseloads but new spikes are Surry and Wilson Counties.
Yes, I did share on ncgis listserv.  Gotta say that one thing that has surprised me is that when I had the idea to write code to convert the JHU cumulative counts to daily counts for all counties, I thought: That is such an obvious thing to do that surely someone else has already done it and made the data available.  Apparently not.  No one has replied and said "Hey, that daily count data for all counties is already available at website blahblahblah."
Is this fixed if you scroll the map? If not, please send me a screenshot. My email link is near the top of this page: https://mappingsupport.com/p2/gissurfer-about-contact.html
People are getting it from beaches and bars and their essential jobs. We should be doing something to address both areas of the problem.
One is not the same as the other though:  >The data show new or ongoing surges of infections in 14 rural counties with **significant meatpacking operations**, including Sampson, Wayne, Bladen, and Duplin Counties—the state leaders for pork production, which together employ 19,000 workers. **Twelve counties with surges are also ranked among the highest in the nation for Covid-19 cases**. In addition to the four above, they include Burke, Chatham, Randolph, Johnston, Robeson, Rowan, Sampson, and Union Counties. Two others with smaller caseloads but new spikes are Surry and Wilson Counties.  -Beaches and Bars get the *most attention*, while most of the cases are coming from meatpacking plants and other essential jobs as I have shown.  Like in Durham:  > In July so far, the greatest number of cases (with known employment information) occurred among people who are unemployed, people working in construction, and people working in hospitals.  https://durhampublichealth-durhamnc.hub.arcgis.com/datasets/ea94109a53734aa38025bd3bf7ff2f7d  -There are *some* cases from beaches and bars, but that shouldn't be our primary focus, IMO
Why’s it say surges in wayne if we are going down I’m so confused are we good or bad?

North Carolina COVID-19 cases surpass 100,000. Experts say it’s just the beginning.

All I want for Christmas is a vaccine, but I'd love a shot at being thankful for one earlier than that, if possible.
oh shut up
>As of Monday, more than 78,000 people had recovered, according to DHHS.  &#x200B;  The 100,000 number of confirmed cases means next to nothing. It's not 100,000 current cases. Its just the total number of positive test results since this began about 140 days ago. It's also only 1% of our state population.  [https://covid19.ncdhhs.gov/dashboard](https://covid19.ncdhhs.gov/dashboard)  Cases: 101,046Tests: 1,423,888Deaths: 1,642  Unofficial Confirmed Death Rate: 1.625%(Considering that many people likely have had this virus and not even know it, leads to the reasonable assumption that the Actual Death Rate is considerably lower.)  There is a lot to be optimistic about. Don't buy into fear mongers.
In three waves, for a short time, with screening, masks, and distancing.  Kinda like we should have been doing things all along.
Thank you! 100k SINCE FEB/MARCH!   Cmon...say it with me....CU MU LA TIVE....NOT ACTIVE  They trot out this flashy headline all the freaking time like desperate criminals. Kindergarten news tactics
Thank you.
Screening? They will be lucky to get temperature checks.   Masks? Well...in theory, but in reality you will have kids fake sneezing on each other thinking it’s funny. Not joking, saw this today at my community pool. Teachers will fight with unruly children to keep their masks on, and good luck with the special help classes.  Distancing? How? Won’t the classes still have the same student to teacher ratio? They aren’t expanding the size of individual classrooms that I know of.   Literally none of that will happen in reality. Just look at Sweden’s numbers. They kept schools open with all those precautions and it has not worked out well for them.
I agree completely with the compliance aspect. However I have someone in my care who is both immune compromised and does not have the capacity to maintain wearing a mask on their own, and I would really like to see a vaccine for their protection.
\^This is one of those fear mongers I was telling yall not to buy into.
>Screening? They will be lucky to get temperature checks.  Uh, that is part of screening, yes, in addition to questions about health status.  >Masks?  Yes, masks.  >Distancing? How? Won’t the classes still have the same student to teacher ratio?   By reducing the number of students actually in the classrooms to 1/3 it's usual size.  I mean, it isn't like Charmeck is trying to hide this information.  It's easily accessible to anyone with the Google.
Why won't she get it?
LOL in February and March they were telling us MILLIONS would be dead. They painted pictures of bodies in stairwells and of hospitals overflowing with patients in the parking lot. And yes, then I said this is fear mongering. I was downvoted into oblivion for the mere suggestion that we might have over reacted.  In January if someone had told me that over 20 million would be unemployed by our response I would have been far more concerned. Some studies have shown that a 1% increase in unemployment results in a 14% rise in violent crime. Not to mention the addiction rates, alcoholism rates, suicide rates, poverty rates, divorce rates etc.  Locking down was not without cost and many people are arguing that it was, without ever considering what the cost actually was. We essentially DOUBLED our Federal annual budget with stimulus efforts. AND we did that as we smashed the economy.  (I don't want to muddle this further by bringing up the damage the Riots have caused that will compound the issue. I will just mention that the cost of the inflation will be far more oppressive than any police force.)     EDIT: BTW 140,000 is only 0.042 Percent of the Estimated American Population. It is a very high number of death by a single cause, for sure. But it is still not a massive amount when compared to the total population.
It’s the devil ya’ don’t know....

COVID-19 and Mental Health in the USA - Seeking participants from North Carolina


Harrah's Cherokee Casino Resort Site of COVID-19 Cluster

What were the odds of that!
Hey, just like in Contagion.
Not surprised at all.
It is a casino...why not gamble with your life?
Play stupid game, win stupid prize
5 employees out of 3,000.  So far...
Hmm a place were people who are REALLY bad at math and cognitive thinking congregate to piss away there meager earnings is a Covid hotspot /s  Reading that back that could describe a Church Or a Casino
I've been up there fishing for the past 3 times in a month.  Everyone walking around with no mask.  Being outdoors = no need for mask
Ba dum tss!!
*Could you blow on these dice for luck?*
The ultimate game
You win, here's your COVID19!
Please elaborate on the math/church part.
Fuck yeah Covid + Harrah's= The Real Hunger Games
Not op, but I'll take a stab. People who go to casinos hoping to win money are either delusional or bad at math, that's pretty self explanatory. People who go to church aren't necessarily bad at math, but there is a negative correlation between being a STEM professional and participating in organized religion, so at least some groups who are very likely to be good at math are less likely to attend church. Obviously, that's a bit more of a generalization, as you don't have to be in a STEM career to be good at math and not all STEM professionals avoid church, but I think that's what he was getting at.
You are expected to tithe 10% of your income to the church to be a "member"  ever ask if that amount is before or after taxes? Why, because it said so in an old Jewish fairy tale book.Up next we have a special collection to payoff the victims of our Pedo priests we refuse to deal with. after that will have a collection for the new building fund. after that will be a collection for the priest retirement fund.  It would be way more honest there was a 3k/year membership fee, if you need to go to a special building were our shaman will to read to you each Sunday. Bottom Line is i am forced to tithe to the government to provide what organized religion purports to need the 10% for.
STEM vs. religion? I started to ask you for a source so I could read about this, but I decided to do my own footwork since you were good enough to reply to me. Mixed bag. Definitely an interesting topic.   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religiosity\_and\_education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religiosity_and_education)
You are asked to tithe 10%. No one is going to kick you out if you don't. And yes, you'll tend to get more say in the goings on if you tithe more, but it's hard to say if that's a correlation to commitment/engagement or pay-to-win.  As someone that identifies as religious (but I don't go to church that much), there are far more compassionate, caring people than there are child molesters and bigots. You don't have to believe me, but I'd guess from your statements and clear disdain that you've probably never had a religious close friend that you respect enough to ask about the real experience.
Hey, can we get a follow up comment where you also degrade Islam, Hinduism, and Buddhism?  That would be fun.
I don't think it's necessarily STEM being opposed to religion, it's just a fact of the human experience that intellectuals don't turn to religion at as high a rate as the general population. There are certainly examples throughout history of science and religion being directly opposed, but I don't think those exceptions aren't really the main drivers behind the disconnect. I can really only speak authoritatively about my own feelings/reasons for that, so I'll try.   For me, the types of existential questions people look to religion to answer don't bother me because science offers a good enough explanation of the things that affect my life. Simultaneously, my experience studying science has conditioned me to be very much ok with just not knowing or understanding things and leaving it at that while I wait for the body of knowledge to advance. I don't understand the metaphysical underpinnings of the universe any better than a random high school dropout, but I'm ok with not knowing, while many people feel the need to seek out supernatural explanations for those questions instead. Hopefully that offers something, but it's really just my own perspective as a single scientist trying to express why I don't find appeal in religion.
> No one is going to kick you out if you don't  That would d pend on your religion.
here ya go:   All organized religion is a scam. Its primary function is to keep the masses in line, with a promise of if you are good on Earth you will somehow be rewarded after your dirt nap  Of all the Religions that claim to be the one true Church, someone has to be wrong, billions of people have to have the wrong Faith.   Individual Religious belief is mostly determined by who/what/were your parent's believed not any truth you found for yourself in the universe.
I can understand your beliefs. I am a chemist and have worked with many scientists, religious and not. I respect anyone's choice, outlook, etc.   That wiki article has lots of things that intrigue me, for instance, that the most religiously fervent in one study were the least educated. At the same time, more than 60% of Nobel laureates were [determined by someone?] religious, or at least have an assignable denomination.
You may be right. I generalized my experience.
Thankfully Buddhism is a philosophy not a religion.
Yeah, it's one of those subjects where it seems like you can logically work out how scientifically minded people might view religion, but the actual research and studies done on it are flawed enough that you can find evidence to support or refute what you think depending on where you look.   As a side note, it appears I ascribed too much thought to the guy you originally replied to. His replies make him come off like a college freshman who just discovered atheism and thinks talking shit about religion makes him edgy. I mean, I'm not about to go to church and I have plenty of strong opinions about organized religion, but that doesn't mean I'm gonna go out of my way to disrespect something that is clearly important to a lot of people like he did.
That's actually not really true - Buddhism certainly functions as a religion, though it is not nearly as unified as we tend to picture in the West. Buddhism has had a remarkable ability to adapt to local myths/culture/religion - which is (part of) why there are fairly vast differences in buddhist practices depending on where you go. (Eg, Pure Land Buddhism is vastly different from what you'd find from a Theravada sect - it's also a prime example of 'feeling' more like what we expect a religion to look like, IMO).   It's really interesting stuff!

UNC to recruit volunteers for COVID-19 vaccine trials

I volunteer pm_your_bacon as tribute
I'm down. Does anyone know if you have to stay in town for a certain length of time during these types of trials? I sometimes travel for work.
If you get paywalled: https://outline.com/zv26me
Totally in. Immunocompromised and every cough has me scared. I'm tired of this.
Anyone have solid info on the trial vaccine itself?  What is it based on/what approach it technology is it utilizing?
I volunteer as tribute
I'll do it if you get paid.
... ya, sure. I'm in.
While i think it's a good thing to have brave people to take these: be sure that you know that you're signing yourself up to be a human guinea pig.
I volunteer all of the folks admonishing others for not wearing masks.
i hope he wins for our district
:(   I'll pass until we have a bit more safety data, I'm optimistic, but cautious with the mRNA approach being utilized.
I believe there would be certain specific days they'd want you to come in for a second dose or follow ups. Otherwise they'd probably be excited to have someone who travels for work sign up.
They will explain the requirements for enrollment very clearly and what the expectations are. Most likely it will be periodic self monitoring followed by a few in-person visits with blood draws.   Not 100% sure though as we haven't seen to design for the trial.
Open the original link in incognito.   But also think about supporting N&O. It’s only $2 a week for a subscription.
deadlink
The design hasn't been released, but it's Moderna's technology so mRNA based (there are no approved human vaccines using this technology).   [Arstechnica](https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/07/meet-the-4-frontrunners-in-the-covid-19-vaccine-race/) has a decent primer for the various vaccines for non-scientists.
Maybe it'll raise up your spirits a bit. Everything ok?
I am a scientist, so can you explain why you (and so many others) are worried about the safety of the mRNA vaccine? I’m genuinely asking.   As someone who understands the science, I want to see why this approach specifically is worrying people.   There are also viral vector vaccines being developed, but no one is talking about being scared of a viral-based vaccine to prevent another virus. Most people are only focusing on the mRNA trials, and I want to understand why.
Yep, that's enough for me.
a friend of mine got paid $400 to see if an already FDA approved inhaler improved covid symptoms. I'd imagine a unnapproved trial vaccine being substantially higher but who knows, im just speculating.
Sure. So my background with mRNA is mostly with gene therapy for orphan diseases, so not quite everything is apples to apples, but I will try my best to explain my concerns:  1. While in theory mRNA based vaccines are much safer than viral vectors or DNA plasmid delivery methods, mRNA is not completely safe as you saw with the Moderna mid and high dose groups.  2. Primarily, most mRNA technology for vaccination has been in the field of cancer immunotherapy and typically use patient derived cells, load the cells up with the mRNA, then give them back to the patient, where a t-cell response will occur. This has added benefit as it reduces the chance of off target effects from the mRNA or introduction of mRNA where it is not supposed to go. Moderna's technology forgoes that thought process. 2. Getting the correct dose for efficacy is going to be huge and why these Phase I/II trials are going to be so important in my mind. With just and injection of the mRNA instead of ex vivo transduction, the body scould remove the mRNA quite quickly with the various RNAses naturally present. The nanoparticles delivery system may help with that, but hard to say without knowing more about their specific technology platform.  2. We dont know if a single loading dose followed by 28 days and then a second dose is going to be enough to prime the immune system. It's basically a good guess, but there may be an alternative schedule that better primes the immune system for protein expression and immune system interaction.  2. Preclinically, mRNA works decently well with limited side effects, but so far, there are no large scale clinical trials that I know of that have shown the efficacy of mRNA delivery for vaccines.  2. There is the potential for the mRNA itself to illicit an immune response before it has the chance to infect cells. If this is the case, you are vaccinating someone against the mRNA strand and not the protein it is supposed to make. That may actually make the body weaker against an actual COVID infection.  3. Without excellent purification methods, there could be some dsRNA contamination, which could lead to interference which might actually lower the bodies immune response. 4. With points 6 and 7 in mind, mRNAs are pretty immunogenic, and again, have the risk of eliciting an immune response without actually producing enough protein to be efficacious as a vaccine.  2. While Moderna isn't using a viral vector for delivery, they are using what appears to be some sort of proprietary lipid nanoparticle (LNP) technology to get the extend the release rate of the mRNA so it is not removed from the body as quickly as it normally would be. LNPs are known to potentially cause increased inflammation as well as potential for clots and even stroke.   While I agree mRNA vaccines are a promising technology, it's difficult to say we have nailed it with one company, especially with so much money being put behind something along with the importance of getting it to work. This is not even addressing some of the issues I see with using AAV technology as is being proposed with other companies delivery methods or all of the manufacturing issues that come along with these technologies.   Anyways, if you need references for the above, I am sure I can dig them up for you, these are just some of the concerns I have from the experience in my particular field of science.
I'm more concerned about the mass manufacture of it, with the oxford vaccine companies have experience with that kind of thing on a large scale and know how to predict and adjust to any problems, with rna its all new on this scale and anything unpredictable is going to delay it.  If the oxford vaccine doesn't pan out we are likely going to be reliant on them unfortunately. The nearest other vaccines to being ready are the chinese adeno vaccine which is a joke and their inactivated one which is liable to require multiple doses which is a problem because manufacturing will struggle with the demand. Plus they are chinese so they might not even give them to the west.  As far as safety goes the oxford adeno vaccine just has a track record because its a modification of something proven safe for a long time which makes it safer in the eyes of the public. I think they will both turn out to be safe but having that track record helps the oxford one with its reputation.
Awesome...here’s your gold.  🥇 fantastic explanation!
I would say that for Phase III they are not using the highest dose and didn’t something close to 100% of those tested develop a robust immune response? I think there’s a lot of promise with the Moderna one.
Do you have a specific reason to be pessimistic about this vaccine? I only ask because no less than Anthony Fauci has publicly voiced optimism for both the Moderna and AstraZeneca vaccines.
The reasons I listed above? There is a big safety risk with mRNA (even if less than plasmids) and we don't know if these vaccines will actually work yet. There isn't a single one approved on market. Coming from the gene therapy world, while it is a very sexy area of science it's a very difficult and filled with even more failures than small molecule work.   I think of the potential COVID vaccines I have seen data for so far, Moderna has the most safety promise, but likely the least amount of efficacy based on what I discussed above. Time will tell though, and I do hope one works not just for COVID, but for the technology which will move forward quickly for many other diseases.
As a complete layman, and only since I worked for Astrazeneca years ago, I read the Lancet publication on AZD2221 on Monday.       In there, they claim 0 adverse effect other than what could be expected from a vectored virus vaccine - mildly elevated body temperature, tenderness, that sort of thing in their 1000+ person Phase I trial...  You say that the Moderna vaccine has your vote for safety though, despite the high dose issues. Is that because you believe those could be overcome before phase II/III?
Very interesting. I'm just amazed that all of the candidates got to Phase I so quickly, and from different directions. Anyway, thanks for the insight, I have a lot more reading to do.

North Carolina sets new one-day high for COVID-19 patients in hospitals

positive test results are down, and hospitalizations lag test results.  We might be seeing the worst of it right now, and it will get better slowly.
18k+ cases, 180 deaths in Meck county. 9 deaths just today. Not slowing here.
9 up from Tuesday. Yawn.  Flatten the fear!!!
The cases are probably getting higher due to all the rioting that just happened, so sad
Or the data is poisoned thanks to the White House. I am going to go with we are not even close to our first peak.
I hope you are right!!!! Also Vote in November
Saw on news today that this peak is from Memorial Day gatherings. Haven’t even seen the July 4 peak yet.
Here’s to hoping. A glance at the data certainly *seems* to indicate that — even if only by way of discouragement —  the mask EO has had a positive impact. Now comes the always difficult diligence phase. I’m also curious to see how schooling impacts things.
It's not fear. It's the sobering realization that there are too many selfish, ignorant COVID deniers out there such as yourself and it's leading to more hospitalizations and more deaths long term.   We should have been at near zero COVID hospitalizations at this point had people followed the SAH orders originally.
State-level data is untainted by the White House, it's aggregation that the White House is poisoning.
Hospitalizations usually lag 2 or 3 weeks -- This looks like 4th of July peaking/beginning to peak to me...
I’m concerned about school opening because of the potential and opportunity to spread Covid if any of these children have sick family members.  And then the opportunity to give it to each other.  Probably find out in a few weeks and fingers crossed I’m wrong.
As soon as SAH got lifted (and the pressure to lift was getting tremendous, and if it wasn't, it was going to be flouted left and right or the state legislature would have gotten a veto-proof majority to end it), it was inevitable.  A big factor was also going to be folks driving to SC to get around it.  Near the end of SAH, folks were driving from Raleigh and Greensboro to SC just to do things.
Oh fucking second yawn. The mythical what coulda been argument (and name calling as usual w you) like we didn’t close down ‘hard enough’. Phone data shows people mostly complied w the SAH order on a rather large scale so if that didn’t work, then it was a flawed strategy to begin with. It’s endemic and not going anywhere (even when the magic vaccine made of eagle tears and unicorn blood comes out) so continuing a lockdown push at the expense of our kids and livelihoods is reckless, harmful to MORE people and kids’ health, and frankly narrow minded (I refrained from a lot of name calling there).   With all this crap you post continually, if you so much as leave your house ever, you’re a hypocrite. Piss off.
I’d love to believe that but everyone I’ve seen has been wearing masks, I’ve even see people driving with them on... but these people In these protest videos seem to be a different story.
State pulls their data from HHS correct?
The problem with non-medical interventions is that as soon as you relax them, the cases go right back up after some time period of silent spread. All we are doing is delaying the inevitable, as long as one active case remains somewhere, this thing will steam right back up until either enough of the population is immune.   We’ve never successfully stopped a pandemic before, and there hasn’t been some great advancement in technology that could stop this one. Every other pandemic that has happened before, we did what we could to slow it down, a whole bunch of people died, and then we moved on. Same thing will happen this time.
We've got really promising vaccine trials in the US , UK, and China.  It's likely at least one works.   The question is whether the government will have the will to force folks to vaccinate if necessary.  This is one scenario where I'd be willing to use force to get folks to take their shot, or just ban the unvaccinated from working period.
His agenda had nothing to do with COVID and everything to do with painting the entirety of the protests as "riots."     Don't fall for his racist bullshit.

Board of Education discussing current COVID-19 actions and the new CDC report. Live Now (Friday 11 AM)

I am Highly skeptical of anything coming from the federal govt at this point.  It was less than two weeks ago that the cdc report saying the very opposite of what they are saying now was scrapped by the white house and they were banned from reporting it to congress.  Here we are today with a brand new report saying to fully reopen schools.  It says the EXACT opposite of the initial report.
As I listen to this, I find some of the questions have a political bent that I wish we could set aside and focus purely on the children, the science, the teachers, etc...    Lets all come together and work this out, set hard metrics for each county to meet that ties in with schools.  Know what we're working towards, whats safe, adapt to new science, and leave our politics at the door.
My county is mad schools are only opening to elementary in person (still rotating groups); and elementary parents are rioting for their kids to not wear masks because...socialism
>Highly skeptical of anything coming from the federal govt at this point.

Fuck Trump and fuck my Republican brethren that are killing people because they're too stupid or too afraid to understand science.
Wait, I thought science is ever-changing because we learn new things all the time?
I had a response to this until I saw you were a libertarian.  I’ll wait 20 years until you grow out of it.
Maybe we can agree about F1, then?  It's just amazing how when policies change to something you agree to it's "science", but when you don't agree it's a conspiracy.
Hell yeah. 3 more races added?   I’m excited about Germany. It’s been awhile.
Germany of course, but Portugal is going to be amazing. I'd be there if not for Covid.

NC ranks at #31: Death rates from coronavirus (COVID-19) in the United States as of July 24, 2020, by state


COVID-19 advice — RI to NC for dying parent
My father had a stroke this week and is getting put into hospice. He’s currently in a hospital in Raleigh. We’ll be coming down from Rhode Island. What sort of limitations does the state have on us outsiders? Could we test as we come into NC to show we’re not carrying the virus? We’ve been hyper-cautious personally up here, and wouldn’t be traveling at all if it weren’t absolutely necessary. My mother is high-risk, so we also have to be careful about what we potentially bring to her. Lots of complications.Thanks in advance.
There are no restrictions for visitors that I'm aware of. YMMV with different hotels if you're staying in one. I'm sorry about your dad, get down here ASAP.
No limitations that I know for visitors.   I have seen an increase for mask use in the area and stores enforcing it more; there may be some people who do not wear masks or come too close so try to distance from them.   Hope that your family gets better.
None, tons of tourists have been coming to NC all summer.  I think you will be quarantining once you get home though.  I am sorry about your father.

President Trump visits N.C. biotech facility producing potential COVID-19 vaccine

I will not take anyone seriously who claims to be “pro life” but won’t wear a mask during a global pandemic. I wear a mask because i care about other people’s life. It’s what Jesus would do. It doesn’t even matter whether it’s  ineffective. I do it because it *might* help save someone else’s life, and it’s easy to do.
The trump-virus has surpassed 150,000 deaths today in the US.  This is not a day to celebrate.  Trumps response has been a miserable failure.  This is well known.
The President is in our great state!  Great day for North Carolina!
Four million cases and growing exponentially.  Still takes a week to get test results, if you can even get a test and hospital workers don’t have enough PPE. Great leadership! /s
 It would behoove you to do better research ~  the virus was released in Wuhan.   Not "Trump-opolis" or whatever the latest   TDS-fake-news-bot-farms are spreading these days.  I love Trump.   Many people I know love Trump & believe he's done a good job with a difficult situation.
Good one!🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
It is on each state to do their own testing -- there is no "one-size-fits-all" right test for every area of the country.
What are your favorite qualities in Trump?
You also understand that where the virus originated and first got transmitted to humans has exactly zero to do with how Trump mishandled things after it landed on our shores, right? Calling it the Wuhan virus or Chinese viruse doesn’t disconnect him from his failed response.
It’s on this administration on how he handles this pandemic after it reached our shores. Completely irresponsible and negligent. Can’t wait to see the books written in years to come about how ineffective he was and how complicit his team was in covering up his ineptitude.
It would behoove you to do better research into how badly your lover boy has screwed the pooch regarding the trump-virus.  Get your head out of the sand.  Please.
You are seriously saying that trump has done a good job with covid19? Seriously?
Released?
You know a lot of dumb people, eh?
I wonder how many of the 150,000 dead Americans would still be alive if Trump had not made mask wearing political?
This is complete bullshit. A national pandemic doesn’t understand state borders. There is no central leadership. This president failed us. See also the MD governor hiding supplies procured from Korea from the feds.
You could not be more wrong. There certainly is a singular test for Covid 19 that is GLOBALLY applicable.   JFC what is wrong with you?   Wake up.
Then why are countries like South Korea, Singapore, and Germany doing so well compared to us? They have national coordinated testing, quarantining, and contact tracing programs that are working. We're getting sick and dying.
Actually, there kind of is.
Hm...   - I love his media savvy  - his bold vision for bringing business/manufacturing back to America & boldness in articulating that vision  - concern for America's national interests: dismantling of U.S. involvement in NAFTA, distancing us from the U.N.; concern for American economy  - his sense of humor  - his pro-life stance, etc.  ...there are more things, that's just what I could think of off the top of my head...
Giving governors control of what happens in their home state is good business management.    What happens in NYC is not the same as what happens in rural Kentucky.    Each state was going to need to be freed-up to respond appropriately to their own state's changing variables.   We're going to have to agree to disagree.
The logic doesn't add up on that one -- Trump was responding to changing data.   The CDC, WHO and others gave wildly different numbers (still do)...heck, Fauci originally estimated "2 million dead".  On Feb. 4 the CDC  - not Trump -- decided not to use the WHO's existing test kits.  CDC made some new tests from scratch, but they were defective, so they had to be pulled off the market.  New test kits from the CDC (they still weren't using the existing WHO tests, for reasons which weren't clear) weren't made until and out to market until the end of February.   In fact, Trump was one of the first to acknowledge the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine, and only now Newsweek and others in the media are finally catching up...   - https://www.newsweek.com/key-defeating-covid-19-already-exists-we-need-start-using-it-opinion-1519535?fbclid=IwAR2IUNO6z3MqxNcIpj4z-bKjSAiroK6MmdqvBTF8qkPHLyQozw81G7jN_rY  A virus is going to act like a virus and Trump made the best of a difficult situation having to sort through a lot of misinformation to get to the truth.
I'm happy to see the evidence, but something tells me you won't provide it.   You may even prefer hysteria to evidence, if posts are any indication.
I find it fascinating that first on your list is media savvy. What does that mean to you and why was it important enough to you that it topped your list?   Additionally, what does pro-life mean to you?
You couldn’t be be more wrong. Just look at how the cases keep increasing.
>governors...good business management  Let’s see you back that claim up woth some actual facts
No!!! that meanie fascist should have assumed emergency dictatorial powers and ruled us like a king for our own good!/s
Nah, Trump only last week (!) announced people should wear a mask, something most had been suggesting for months already. He didn't keep up with changing data, he flat-out ignored it.   That leadership failure is spectacular. Shoot, even Gov *Abbott* pivoted sooner than Trump!
In a reply to a simple question about masks, you forgot to address masks. You’re so delusional and so desperate to make excuses for his mishandling of the situation.
"Media savvy" -- as in, Trump knows how to sidewind the media into showing its empty hand, and he knows how to turn a phrase to get people to investigate the facts which are so often being covered up by that very media.     - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeNhqHgHYJc  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LibRNYJmZ-I  "Pro-life"  means "for life" -- from conception to natural death.
Why do you think so many of our peers have made more success with their COVID response than we have?
They really can't make up their mind, can they?
?  Why would anyone comment on masks?   It is common knowledge at this point that they don't work and are a placebo.  Commenting on them are a waste of everyone's time.  https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/04/150422121724.htm?fbclid=IwAR2s8RfYQksKrrR73UTlk4p_hxjHKqSPgl9aiZ2Z01MBLO5BRFXJTv0mQlw   https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/65/11/1934/4068747?fbclid=IwAR1qnfNVZEkj7gNIsMZp5lOCGEyexuWaCdVriLNFuDkY19ZCp4t1zlv_tiM   https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/04/commentary-masks-all-covid-19-not-based-sound-data?fbclid=IwAR1bR2FCaRKY_PMdStUUvSrC-6aAfUIYlL8yrdPo-6wfzZLescSoEkI4Qh4   https://cmr.asm.org/content/28/3/743?fbclid=IwAR0HDGQlTDX9N-5aidVJNYbtgdJanB7aKNMgX5tOSssUTVV3J66WG_pFVmk   https://www.osha.gov/Publications/OSHA3219.pdf?fbclid=IwAR1VWAKDBx8nZ9IRDjnUPfEXrObfhauHzmrCu_gGiw2t9o17vqPtdliG3yM   https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12879-019-4109-x?fbclid=IwAR3sHkU1WuKiVt-175kwhzxAIjan7Q4apiteDG68e4K0Ab_nrbCV5DbJE9U   https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/65/11/1934/4068747?fbclid=IwAR1qnfNVZEkj7gNIsMZp5lOCGEyexuWaCdVriLNFuDkY19ZCp4t1zlv_tiM   https://nypost.com/2020/05/28/healthy-people-should-wear-masks-only-if-caring-for-coronavirus-patients-who-says/?fbclid=IwAR0hCAesaBNNAcao0kKeOZmOja_McQhPaXqLpHsbQc0suVh6dQL2hg72hj4   https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16490606/   https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20092668/   https://pjmedia.com/news-and-politics/megan-fox/2020/05/14/neurosurgeon-says-face-masks-pose-serious-risk-to-healthy-people-n392431?fbclid=IwAR11bES94jX-BiWznnTcfdJHIK0-awVYw08oGoUIWpsmgv2X6WSgmqRWDLY
You didn't read carefully.  The CDC - not Trump - were the ones who rejected the WHO testing kits.  The kits you've provided an ad for here are universal in the sense that anyone can use them, but they weren't rolled out or made available until later in 2020.      They have  -- like your entire story -- nothing to do with Trump.  TDS is a real condition. It causes people to react myopically and hysterically to evidence regarding Trump. Help is [available]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gp3OZwu8gcQ).
Interesting. What has Trump done for you to believe he cares about anyone from conception to natural death. I assume you’re of the opinion that the media would never report it, so I’m sure I just haven’t heard it... but I’m all ears for sure.
So, it kinda sounds to me like you don't really *like him* but rather you just *dislike the media*. Like, at a more essential level. Like he's just a means to an end for you, or that sort of thing.
Serious answer: I don't know if we have, or have not, had less success than our peer states. But I do know that an appropriate response is determined and then carried out by each state on an individual basis. So if you have any objections to the way NC has handled the pandemic, it makes more sense to direct them to the governor, Roy Cooper.
> It is common knowledge at this point that they don't work and are a placebo.   Holy fuck. That is one of the most batshit insane things I’ve heard someone say.    Some of your sources have disclaimers or updates saying they’re most likely wrong. Others talk about how N95 masks don’t actually filter out 95% of COVID particles. So cool, thanks for wasting everyone’s time with articles that are irrelevant to the real mask discussion. The point of people wearing masks is to block stuff from going out much more so than stuff coming in. It’s a selfless act to wear a mask because you’re protecting everyone from you instead of the other way around. The people who don’t wear masks in public are selfish assholes who endanger everyone around them.
The president is insisting on cutting funding for covid testing in the new stimulus bill, he is sabotaging testing because he thinks more confirmed cases make him look bad. how blind do you have to be.
Why didn’t trump override the cdc then and make the tests available to everyone?
You are correct that the media didn't report it...he outlined his pro-life position at the March for Life in 2020, where he spoke.    He is the first sitting president ever to speak at the March for Life.
What role do you think the federal government plays in supporting those state’s decisions?
Those sources are scientific and medical journals.  You seem not to understand:   -- if N95 masks (the strongest) don't block out COVID and...   -- if surgical masks are only used to keep objects/spit out of a sterile field, and not to block virions, and...   -- if most people are walking around in much *less* than N95 or surgical masks, and are actually walking around in earloop and cloth masks which offer actually less protection than these  - N95 masks only block particles smaller than 1000 nanometers.  Covid 19 is 125 nanometers, so much smaller....  ...then facemasks are a complete waste of everyone's time.    That's science.  I like science.  Science>hysteria
Let me know when you have any evidence.  "Post history" has nothing to do with the evidence or lack thereof regarding FACTUAL INFORMATION about Trump.  FACTS MATTER.  >praises Ku Klux Klan  ?!?  Only that didn't happen. In what insane world are you living?   [Perhaps this one-when Hillary eulogizes Robert C. Byrd](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0DbPnfpVus) and the TDS has got you projecting?  >babies in cages  The [detention centers that were set up by Obama?](https://www.boston.com/news/politics/2018/05/30/ap-fact-check-2014-photo-wrongly-used-to-hit-trump-policies)  The TDS is strong.  Evidence > hysterical, hand-wringing, "orange-man-bad" narrative.  10/10  You have my prayers.  Do better research.
Ehh... I’m well aware he spoke there. But I’m going to need you to direct me to anything he’s said — or more importantly done — to square with what you said. He paid a lot of lip service to anti-abortion folk and spoke about “family”, but I’ll need your help to find anything the indicates he cares about Anton from down the street. The guy that’s been working 3 jobs to make rent because his wife has cancer and can’t work. They still can’t afford treatment, right now they’re just trying to not be homeless. I don’t think Anton and his family are alone either.
Giving and updating all available information, submitting guidelines and, if there are unforeseen circumstances, rendering emergency aid to a state in distress. The federal government should also be seeking possible treatments if they are able to.
I understand perfectly well. You have some issues understanding though. Did you read that part where I said the masks are mostly to block out instead of blocking in? They don’t need to block the tiny 125 nm COVID particle, because COVID particles usually have to travel on much other water droplets. If you block the water droplets, then you block most of the COVID. Also, the portion that does make it past the mask doesn’t travel nearly as far since there masks helps slow the outward projection.    Anyone who is still preaching that masks are bad or don’t work is either: a) stupid, or b) has malicious intent and wants people to die.    You previously claimed to be a big pro-lifer. There is absolutely no way you can honestly be pro life and anti mask. That would be just as insane as someone claiming to be pro life and anti-vax.
How do you believe homelessness should be solved?   What is your vision/plan?  Some of Trump's pro-life accomplishments include:  ~https://www.sba-list.org/trump-pro-life-wins  ~https://www.kusi.com/san-diegos-homeless-providers-on-possible-help-from-trump-administration/  ~https://fox59.com/news/report-president-trump-to-sign-executive-orders-to-lower-drug-prices/  Trump isn't going to singlehandedly "cure" homelessness, esp. not when [democrat governors and mayors]( https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2019/07/02/trump_we_may_intercede_on_homelessness_crisis_in_california.html) want to [buck the help he is offering their cities](https://www.kusi.com/san-diegos-homeless-providers-on-possible-help-from-trump-administration/).  It's going to take every community doing their part.  He has so far, done a lot.
So I assume you think the federal government has screwed the pooch on this one then?
I'm pro-life and pro-science.  You still seem to be having a hard time with the science.  >*if you block the water droplets, you block most of the COVID*  This is unscientific.  A mask can be saturated - or brought to a saturation point -- with water droplets.   If the particles inside the droplets are greater than 1000 nanometers,  those particles would be kept out.  (Bacteria, for example, which tend to be 1000 nanometers in size or larger, would be blocked.)  Virions, however, range from about 100 nm to 900 nm and the masks DO NOTHING FOR VIRIONS.   Whether the mask is wet or whether the mask is dry makes no difference.   Virions will not be blocked, as their particle size is too small.  >Anyone who is still preaching that masks are bad or don’t work is either: a) stupid, or b) has malicious intent and wants people to die.  Anyone who is still preaching that masks work is either a) uninformed, or b) has political intent and is allowing TDS to cloud their thinking, block the study of science, and to attempt to karenize and control their neighbors for political purposes.   Please seek help.   And study the science more.
For starters it’s not just about homelessness but, universal healthcare and a proper living wage would be a good place to start. Perhaps also a maximum worth cap. No one should have to work three jobs to afford basic needs while there are individuals worth billions. The bootstraps argument is a lie. No person can “work hard” enough to become a billionaire. Billionaires are are made from stepping on the backs of the people that make it possible. A billionaire cannot be pro-life given the greed and dishonesty it requires to become one. And to be clear, I’m not against people becoming wealthy. But I am vehemently against the hoarding of wealth.   Regarding your links:  1) Nothing here is pro-life, this is anti-abortion  2) Did you read this article? Did you listen to the exchange he had with Carlson?  He doesn’t want to help the homeless back into “traditional” society, he wants them gone from the “beautiful cities”.  He showed more concern for the cops possibly getting sick walking the beat than for the people who live day in and day out on the street.   3) I mean. This is something, I guess. I love the quote from the article that “American’s will *get* to pay less for prescription drug”. That’s just asinine. In this moment, I guess any help is welcome but, to paint as being pro-life from conception to death is just simply incorrect.   You know, something I noticed from the links you shared... there wasn’t ever a plan. Ever. Just mention of the problem and “we’re looking into it”. Even the EO didn’t outline a plan. That’s the appearance of due diligence rather than actual due diligence.
Yeah, the CDC woefully under-performed and careers should end over this.
You’re wrong about everything you say. I know I can’t get through to you because you’ve been brainwashed too hard by the cult of trump, but in case any reasonable person is reading your responses, they need to know that you’re lying.   Saying you’re pro life does not make you in favor of more people living. Saying you’re pro science does not mean you understand science and believe in real science. Trying to sound smart does not make you a smart person.    Since you say you’re pro science, can you confirm the following: 1) you acknowledge climate change is real, it’s caused by humans, and it’s a problem that needs to be addressed.  2) evolution is real. Humans were not created, but evolved from other mammals over millions of years.  3) vaccinations are effective and necessary.
Interesting take. So I’m assuming by your comment you think the White House handled it well then, yah?

The number of new coronavirus cases reported in North Carolina Wednesday – 1,843 – set a record. It is the largest number of cases reported on a single day since the outbreak began.

Still at about 10% of tests (17k+).   The problem with these numbers is that it’s a collection of test results from anywhere in the past 1-2 weeks, meaning some of these people were tested two weeks ago and we’re just adding them to the count of positives.   It also comes as Cohen has said there’s a new focus on resting everyone at congregate care facilities and hot spots. Considering that, it’s actually good that it’s stayed flat.
Good news though, I had to be out quite a bit today and I didn’t see one person not wearing an a mask, even at the Teeter after the announcement of their somewhat neutral position on the subject.   I do think more people are taking it seriously now. Perhaps the numbers are sinking in, peer pressure or knowing someone who has gotten sick. It’s like Covid is real again, like during the lockdown.
Come on NC get your shit together🧐I saw several people out and about yesterday with no masks. Hopefully everyone will start taking this seriously again.
This further reinforces the need for the mandatory mask order and remaining in phase 2 for a bit. We're gonna see the benefits in about two weeks. Fortunately our growth has been linear rather than an exponential boom, unlike what we're seeing in Florida, Texas, and Arizona.
And yet I still see people out here with no masks. Very sad sight.
COVID SUUURRRRRGE 🤘😎
The NC Covid dashboard lists tests by day the samples were collected. It isn't great for seeing what is going on over the past week as tests are still being analyzed, but shows a much more directly upward trend than the date reported. It shows two 2000+ days last week.
You and I definitely don't live in the same area. Maybe half are wearing them in stores here, and almost no one is while outside, even in the heavily congested areas. I get some heavy side-eye for wearing mine when I have to go out (no one's said anything yet thankfully), but I work around first responders all day and they are starting to drop like flies, so you'd best believe I'm masked up.
The only issue is folks who want to get around all this stuff can just go to South Carolina and bring it back.  This limits the effectiveness of anything we do here, especially for the Charlotte area.
The number of hospitalizations w/ COVID-19 has stayed level for about the past 10 days, which imo is a more important statistic
Ive got my surfboard ready to ride the wave! Gnar Gnar!
> now we are getting back to the point of testing supply shortages.  Do you have a source on that piece? I work for a large medical provider and nothing has been mentioned to us about supply shortages now and they update us daily.
 My friend, stay masked up and eff the haters. Seriously, you have to take care of yourself and your loved ones.  I live in Raleigh and was at Walmart and Dick’s Sporting Goods around 3:00 this afternoon, then went to HT around 4:00, so not during a rush hour and it was also a weekday. Maybe the attitude might be different during the weekday vs the weekend.   I can’t put my finger on what seems to have shifted, but I was  surprised at the vigilance that I saw today.

>	I can’t put my finger on what seems to have shifted, but I was surprised at the vigilance that I saw today.  Is the exact opposite here. This area was doing amazingly well in the beginning, most were doing what they were supposed to and our infection rates were very low.  Then phase 2 happened and everyone lost their damn minds.
It’s important to remember that unless you are wearing a properly fitting n95 mask, you are not protecting yourself with a mask you are protecting others.   Which is still the right thing to do, mind you. It’s what Jesus would do. But remember to be careful around others who are not wearing theirs-they are exposing you.
I went to Walmart in Cary Monday and the only employee properly wearing their mask was the person at the door watching people walk in improperly wearing their mask. Half had their mask half off their face, just covering their mouth. The others either weren’t wearing one at all, or had it completely under their chin.
So if I'm reading your first article correctly, it was a poll conducted in the month of April. Am I mistaken here?  Also it seemed to me from the article about pooled testing, it was to get more data.
We did pretty well in phase 1 also, but all of a sudden wearing big masks became politicized, with predictable results. Still there are some people who just don’t give a rats patoot.   Perhaps the vigilance has come from more stores enforcing the precautionary guidelines. I wouldn’t be surprised if some of the people wearing masks were only doing so because Walmart wouldn’t let them in otherwise.

Coronavirus live updates: Here’s what to know in North Carolina on July 4

Alright, the NC Covid numbers were updated.   Let's cue the reddit users with no background in infectious disease giving their uninformed opinions about why these numbers 'aren't as bad as they seem.'
i did not go many places over the weekend...walmart and grocery store...i would have half the people are wearing masks...and a percentage of them are wearing them with nose being out....
it’s july 5th
Pretty much. Everything is going up still and somehow because they aren't piling the dead in the street, "it's not that big of a deal".
Seems like OP is the only one refusing to look at all the data.
"Record hospitalizations" seems a little misleading. It looks like admissions are down from the beginning of June and so are ICU admissions.  They're not reporting data in an honest way during these panic porn press releases.
Death rates and hospital admissions aren't going up. You just don't understand how to read a bar graph and believe your leaders aren't misleading you.
Record hospitalizations are according to the state's official dashboard - see [here](https://covid19.ncdhhs.gov/dashboard/hospitalizations).
Any time I read the words “panic porn press release” I’m compelled to ask something like this:  In your opinion, where do the metrics need to be for you to decided it’s a proper problem? For the tone to switch from a slightly patronizing down speak to one of genuine concern?
Which holiday weekend? Covid wouldn't even have had time.to do a damn thing since yesterday to be up by 20%
I just stated a fact
Are you being sarcastic? Because the graph in the article very clearly shows consistent increase in hospitalizations.
Okay?
It is absolutely a problem. Something being a problem doesn't give politicians the right to select which data gets reported, i.e. politicizing the problem and shaping the narrative how it suits them.  Do you not believe that politicians and the media attempt to shape narratives about actual problems? Do you believe anyone who is skeptical about these narratives denies that actual problems still exist?
I said admissions....  Can no one here read?  How does the "science and data" crowd have such a poor grasp on the most rudimentary ability to interpret data? Hospitalizations can increase independent of admissions if there aren't enough discharges to offset lower admissions.
You're accusing them of dishonest data reporting, when it's the best information we have from the state
Ahh. The ol’ answer a question with a question response. That one’s a classic.
Ah gotcha. I mean haven't we been hovering around 8-11% positive for a while though? Like if that number is relatively stable then I'm.not sure we have a ton to worry about. Now if in two weeks it jumps from the fourth of july celebrations then that is something to report.
> Total tests from today (July 5th, from yesterday July 4th) are down 20%.  Because it's the weekend. Testing *everywhere* is low/weak/incomplete on the weekend compared to the week as some labs are closed on the weekend. Expect the numbers to return to "normal" either today or tomorrow.
again, I just stated a fact, the date.
Sorry, didn't realize that you meant to differentiate new admissions from total hospitalizations.   Either way though, the fact of the matter is that the hospitalization number is going up, whether that's from increased term of stay or from increased admissions. There are still only so many beds in a hospital.
Did you actually read what I said? It is an incomplete presentation of the data and I provided evidence by adding additional data. Incomplete presentation of data can be dishonest.
>It is absolutely a problem  Does anyone here actually read what they're fucking responding to?
Hospitals aren't having an issue with capacity almost anywhere in the US and rate of admissions is an important number regarding severity of spread of infection. They are reporting on one number and not the other which leaves out important context. If hospitals are not being overwhelmed then admission rate is a more important number for the public than current number of inpatients. They are only reporting on number of patients because it looks bad when you keep showing scary red arrows and people don't understand what it means.   Case in point literally every response I've gotten in this thread is a ton of downvotes and people who think I'm making things up because they don't even understand the data.
Did you read what OP said? The state is tracking hospitalizations due to COVID and it's still up. And quite a bit as are COVID like syndrome cases in the ER.   Do you have additional data regarding COVID specific ICU cases and admissions?
> In your opinion, where do the metrics need to be for you to decided it’s a proper problem? For the tone to switch from a slightly patronizing down speak to one of genuine concern?  You tell me? The second sentence there is an important one.
The reopening has been bungled since the start I have very little faith any of it will be handled well in the future.  I mean you really can't have a good explanation with the way they've mishandled bars in general. I get why they won't open non-food service bars but they allow other bars to operate without impunity till two am. One it's screwing the other bars out of much needed financial support and two it's concentrating the entire drinking population of areas in one or two tightly confined spaces. Like people at these 'restaurants' are literally standing on top of each other
Hmmmm yeah that does sound accurate. Honestly based on what you said, it sounds like the real number that should be reported is the percentage of hospital space that's currently occupied rather than just a raw number. I mean 900 people in the hospital sounds bad, but how many beds are there?  Sorry if I came off as arrogant or a smartass or anything. Your perspective is an important one.
Yes, I already responded to this....  Am I not speaking English here, how is this so confusing?
It should be a genuine concern for everyone. Why are you trying to change the subject and continue pretending I didn't answer?  Do you not believe that politicians and the media attempt to shape narratives about actual problems? Do you believe anyone who is skeptical about these narratives denies that actual problems still exist?
It's no problem at all, hard not to superimpose stereotypes onto strangers on the internet and I'm fully aware my comments may seem like the typical anti-mask/ it's all a hoax nonsense but I promise I'm not lol. You're right and they often do report bed capacity taken which has hovered around 70% everywhere which is.... Where hospitals tend to stay, at 70%.   That's also not say total inpatients isn't important, it definitely shows an increase in spread now compared to a month ago, but when they leave out context and just keep *only* reporting on bad numbers (deaths per day hasn't changed basically since March) it's hard not to assume they're playing politics and obfuscating the actual severity of things.
I asked you a specific question with a specific qualifier. The subject hasn’t changed and you’ve yet to answer it. So here it is again.    >In  your opinion, where do the metrics need to be for you to decided it’s a proper problem? For the tone to switch from a slightly patronizing down speak to one of genuine concern?
Nope another part of our backwards ass government
>Do you have data from that  Look at inpatient admissions over time from the NCDHHS website.   >my anecdotal evidence of local ICU nurses  "Science and data" lol  Yes, admission rates can decline and inpatient census can still rise based on discharge rates. I did not say your Lord and Savior Cooper's presentation was "wrong", I said it was incomplete and therefore dishonest, intending to portray a narrative rather than objective truth and I explained why I believe this to be the case using more complete data.   Thanks for verifying you didn't even understand my reply to you, probably the reason you skipped it and jumped down the thread :)
The metrics indicate a problem, that's why I said there's a problem twice and said people should be concerned, you know, based on metrics. Now I'm just questioning your literacy.
The admissions rate piece you mention here doesn’t tell a full story either. You could have a declining admission rate but it’s still higher than your discharge rate therefore census increases...Hospitalization in absolute terms matter but not in all terms. I wouldn’t say the cooper is being intentionally misleading I think it’s more a function of we are a society of idiots so what’s the point of overloading ya with the info or they really may not have all the info.
> Look at inpatient admissions over time from the NCDHHS website.  Can you link it, because I don't see the graph you seem to keep referencing that you are saying is 'incomplete data'.   > "Science and data" lol  LOL? WTF is wrong with you?  >  did not say your Lord and Savior Cooper's presentation was "wrong", I said it was incomplete and therefore dishonest, intending to portray a narrative rather than objective truth and I explained why I believe this to be the case using more complete data.  Lord and Savior? Again, what is wrong with you? This isn't Cooper's data, although I imagine he uses it to make decisions for the state. The metrics selected were from data that is able to be collected and the CDC and White House issued as metrics for COVID in the US.   > Thanks for verifying you didn't even understand my reply to you, probably the reason you skipped it and jumped down the thread :)  Thanks again for spending so much time on this thread not answering anyone's questions. Yikes dude. Maybe I dunno like talk to someone if you have that many mental issues, I am a bit worried about you.
> Now I'm just questioning your literacy.  I think people are questioning your ability to base any of your statements with data. But then again you have a brand new account with almost zero karma. Forgot you were just a troll.
>Now I'm just questioning your literacy.  No you’re not. No more than I am yours. But I’ll be more pointed if that helps. Your tone, your language, the general sentiment of your comment was one or dismissiveness. You can absolutely believe there is a problem and also believe it’s not one of utmost severity. Hell, ask the president or any number of governors.   So I’ll try one more time. Where do the numbers need to sit for you to consider this of utmost severity?
I don't mean to imply that it's the full story but it's a very important piece of information, especially when you omit admissions but include "hospitalizations". Decreasing admissions actually shows a positive trend while hospitalizations just tells us the status of hospitals themselves, which are fine. They aren't even close to overloaded and in all likelihood never will be.  Admissions and ICU beds have trended down, deaths have no increased, but they are ommiting that and only using total number hospitalized. I don't think there's any way this isn't intentional politicization where they are trying to extend and obfuscate the crisis. You're right that we are a society of idiots but look at the outcomes: you have a bunch of people on one side who don't believe anything because the government is giving misleading data and you have a bunch of people on the other side who can't even read a fucking bar graph like OP but they're convinced the benevolent governor Cooper loves them with all his heart and is basing all this off "science and data".
Do you see admissions over time at their site? There's literally a bar graph that shows admissions over time with level of care.
>ill try one more time. >>*consider this of utmost severity?*  While this is a **new** question, I consider it of utmost severity.   You're going to great lengths to divert attention away from my original criticism of Cooper and the dishonesty of his intentionally politicized narrative to try finding some ancillary faulty opinion you're imagining i have.  Either discuss the data or don't, I really don't care about you trying to find some personal, opinion-based reason to discredit my criticism.
If you legitimately couldn’t extrapolate that from the original question, we probably aren’t going to go far, chief.
the NCDHHS website, you know, the part where they list their covid metrics. **The link is in your post**, click it. Look for graphs. One shows admissions over time and level of care. It's a bar graph. I hope this helps.   Are you *playing* dumb or.......
I answered your original question and your rephrased question. I think you're not even sure what your fucking point was supposed to be now and you're just being argumentative for the sake it.
Not sure why you cant link it.   The NCDHHS COVID dashboard lists the following:  * Daily cases * Daily Tests * Daily Number of People Hospitalized * And then a County Map  Additionally there is a link for CLI Surveillance, Case, Testing and Hospitalizations. The Hospitalizations link gives Currently Hospitalized and then bar graphs for Bed Totals and Ventilator Totals.   Again, can you simply provide a link regarding COVID hospitalization admissions over time showing they have been going down? That's what you said there is a chart for, the one I am seeing show's hospitalizations over time, and that is increasing.   What is your problem with supplying the link to the data you keep saying is 'incomplete'?
Not sure if trolling or projecting but I appreciate your commitment either way.
>Not sure why you cant link it.   You. Literally. Posted it. It's the same link. It's a link that you've already looked at in your post that you posted and yes, you have to look at the surveillance data to see admissions over time.   There's a graph that shows level of care and number of admissions. I seriously don't know how to make you able to look at a graph correctly. Its not my fault you got a liberal arts degree and you're arguing about science.
And you cant link it to show exactly what you are talking about? Please try again. Someone that literally can't for the life of him link exactly the chart he is talking about. Anyways, I am finished here, you have clearly shown your lack of knowledge on the topic.   Stay safe and wear a mask.
There's no link to the table..... You follow the link you posted and you have to look at the graphs, I even tried to make it really easy for you to be able to find it by describing what's on its axes. I can't help that you literally don't understand how to look at graphs and you're trying to argue about data lol  Definitely starting to see why so many people in here ignore your low effort trolling.
Click on CLI surveillance then click on COVID-19 Surveillance summary? Tons of graphs there
Yes that's what I'm referring to, read my comments, that's where I'm trying to direct this troll while he pretends to not be able to find any graphs.
Thank you! Found it by reading your comments. i'm not the smartest but if i can find it...
Lol sorry, no big deal. OP is pretending he can't find the data because he doesn't want to acknowledge that the governer is politicizing this.

North Carolina has now conducted more than 1,000,000 coronavirus tests

These type of posts are best as links rather than images so people can view the raw data themselves and evaluate sources.
So 10% of us, once, in 4 months or so? We failed.
Where is that graph from?
Dude, 10% of the population in 4 months is absurd.
where are you finding the 10% figure?
https://rt.live/us/NC
There's about 10 million people in NC.
Aah, so 10% of North Carolinians have gotten tested, not infected.
I mean not exactly, but sort of an illustration of how few tests have actually been done. Someone tested in April or June could be a carrier now.

North Carolina has now conducted more than 1,000,000 coronavirus tests

“The tracker calculates Rt, or the effective reproductive rate, which is the virus’ transmission rate a given time. “  I saw RT and had to go look it up to make sure it was Russia Today lol
This is super interesting. Thanks OP.  I wonder why Rt steadily rose approaching the end of lockdown but then dropped back down again after it ended. I'm also surprised to see the adjusted infections so high, so early. Not sure I believe that given spread is not linear but exponential. It would also seem to me that hospitalizations would loosely correlate with the adjusted trend although I believe there are many other factors contributing to the current increases in hospitalizations, especially since ICU admissions aren't rising at the same rate.
>I wonder why Rt steadily rose approaching the end of lockdown but then dropped back down again after it ended.  Hopefully this is because of increased mask usage. Anecdotally I've noticed better adoption in public areas.
Could be, I'm pretty sure masks do work but I'm not sure that explains their calculations. I kind of think they're just wrong.

North Carolina Coronavirus Map and Case Count


Coronavirus cluster in UNC athletics department; voluntary football workouts paused

We aren't going to have college football this fall, maybe they try to do a spring season. And Mack Brown is pushing 70, it would put him in a difficult position
I'm ok with pro sports since they get paid and I think we need some sports to get folks in a better mood and more willing to do what's needed, but college sports shouldn't happen.
College sports also derive a lot more of their revenue from ticket sales, so showing a game without fans often doesn't make a ton of sense. Even moreso in the ACC where we generally aren't dealing with big fan bases or big  games(or big media contracts for that matter)
The ACC has a pretty big media contract.  It's not SEC or B10 big, but I think it's the 4th largest per school.  If anything the ACC has lower ticket sales due to the private schools like Wake and BC dragging down the rest of the conference.
ACC has the 2nd lowest media contract among p5. And even if you discard the private schools there just aren't many football schools, and the stadiums tend to be smaller. UNC stadium is only 50k which would be the second smallest in the sec and four schools have more than double the size

Gyms Reopening May Not Facilitate Coronavirus Infections, Study Finds

The study was done in Europe, not in the US. The situation here is so much worse with regards to community transmission I would be very skeptical that the results are valid here.
Removed: rule 5
Ugh...can we PLEASE have a bill that passes all the way thru on this? People need to be healthy and the data is clear...just wear a mask while working out (it doesn't cause breathing issues...) and clean your stuff (plus reducing capacity, of course).
That's fair... 🥺 The other big challenge here would be people (and companies!) actually following whatever guidelines were implemented to keep people safe...
It relates to NC bc there's a continuous debate about gyms opening with at least three bills having been proposed (and vetoed) by the Gov. This is an article about a study done in other countries regarding the same in hopes to educate what's happening in relation to the current topic. Furthering a science/data-based conversation.   Agreed on the business model comment.
I love the gym, but let’s be real. Some people barely wear a mask while shopping now. And even before COVID, some people didn’t bother cleaning the machines after using them, and/or they’d leave dirty towels all around. Group fitness instructors would tell people to clean off the class equipment while sweaty people were putting the equipment away without cleaning it. If people are going to be filthy and do what they want, I don’t see how gyms aren’t going to be hot spots. Common courtesy isn’t so common.
No.
Find one of the many, many gyms that are open and flying under the radar and join that one if you’ve such an issue.
That's pretty true... unfortunately.
No way. I don't support the business owners who are going rogue and also not limiting capacity or following any social distancing standards. People are really talking their lives into their own hands at many of those.
It was already removed by an admin...so...
It makes me annoyed. It’s not like it takes that long to for people to clean up after themselves. I want to get back to the gym, but it’s this small percentage of jerks that would ruin it for everyone else and then gyms would get closed again.
Ok so by your logic here, be patient. Or invest in your own equipment.

Family gathering infects 41 people with the coronavirus, NC health official says

It is so sad that a lot of the infected outside of the family are labeled as patients. It's heartbreaking and infuriating that the 65 yo was infected because their family member is a coworker to one of the attendees.
Just imagine what that graph would have looked like if those infected children has been in school Or camp
My whole extended family meets every year for a weekend of just being around each other, eating, having fun,  and every time it's great and memorable. That chart is exactly why most of us skipped this year. A token few would've gladly met up without hesitation (no masks/distancing), which is why charts like this one are created.
I have two step daughters. One is a nurse who recently worked on a Covid ward. The other works in a radiology department, checking in patients before MRI and other procedures.   Their step sister was diagnosed with Covid two days ago and their step mother is now showing symptoms. My wife keeps inviting them into our house for a variety of reasons.  I am immunosuppressed due to an autoimmune disease.   I think my wife may be trying to get me sick.
I spent two hours trying to convince my mom that having a pig pickin' for 100+ in the middle of a pandemic is not a good idea.  What sold her on calling it off was convincing my dad that he, as a 65+ year old, didn't have any buisness spending hours upon hours shoveling coals in 90 degree weather.
The graphic is actually pretty interesting to see how crazy this virus spreads.  Honestly, Burke and the surrounding area is likely going to see a huge spike soon too.  The Last Reformation had a gathering of 500 +/- people on the weekend of July 4-6th, and the organizer discouraged social gathering and masks.
This article is going around on Facebook in my parts. Comments are mostly whataboutism about the protests and how the media is trying to "prove" people shouldn't do family gatherings.   I swear it takes all my willpower not to respond and call these Covidiots out.
My friends and family will hang with several other people because they “know those people have been distancing”. But who knows how many those friends have said the same thing about.
So, by extension we were all there. Sorry I missed the potato salad.
To those wondering why our numbers are still going up despite the mask order: it's shit like this.
What stands out glaringly to me is that people gave it to co-workers...how? Why don't these businesses have safety guidelines in place? It should be assumed that anyone and everyone could be a covid carrier in any place of business (at least until there are reliable ways to prove otherwise). These co-workers were like lambs to the slaughter in their work places. This is one of the things that makes me most angry. People have no choice but to work since the government doesn't want to give "lazy" people any more money, so you have to work and risk your life and your family's lives. The government fiddles while Rome burns. I just feel such a sense of impending doom.  Edit: if you down vote this, please tell me why.
This is happening all across the country. I think I saw stories like this for TX and FL last week.
The breathtaking selfishness of those people. Someone, likely more than one, will die because those people just had to chat and chew some BBQ.
This is so infuriating.  Stay home!!!! Why is that hard?!? If you can’t stay home, at least wear a mask. It’s SO SIMPLE!!! It’s not worth the risk. My heart goes out to the infected folks...it’s amazing how selfish people can be.
Going to a cousin's wedding in 2 weeks, I've already bought myself and other immediate family members N95 masks. I figure if there was a time to use PPE designed to protect the wearer (and not just other people) a wedding would be it. I'll probably wear gloves for most of it too, leave as soon as the cake is cut (since I'm responsible for it), and get tested the next day. I'm really hoping this all turns out ok.
r/LeopardsAteMyFace
Also interesting to see that none of the spread was linked to the young children. This backs up some recent news about very young children not being vectors and could be considered safe to attend school.
What is really sad is that the 65 yr old was probably staying inside to avoid the virus, and lack of masks/social distancing *by others* brought it to her/him, anyway :(
Right? How quickly it spread to coworkers and neighbors before detection is terrifying.  The only thing that would make it worse would be if summer camps and schools were fully open — then each of the children would have some additional lines of spreading as well.
This honestly terrifies me. My husband works for our local school system (he’s not a teacher) and the stories he hears about how lazy some of the staff is in schools does not make me confident that my kids will be safe from COVID while at school. Plus, teachers practically beg us for Clorox wipes and hand sanitizer throughout the year. We can’t find that stuff now and I doubt the school system, who didn’t supply it before, will be ponying up to adequately stock each classroom and office.
Won't have to imagine, just wait one month
My family does the same. I think I'm going to skip this year, even though my cousin is getting married that weekend.
My family does the same, we get cousins from all across the country.  Thankfully, we made the decision to call off the reunion this year, because I'd say a good 75%+ fall into the at-risk category.
I canceled the family reunion this year. It was supposed to be tomorrow.   I've got a couple of Fox News diehards in the family (I guess every family has a few) who would have gladly gone on with it this year.   Thankfully they are not in charge of it.
Who is keeping a running list of organizations and leaders who are on the record with this sort of stuff? It shouldn't be forgotten.
I'm in Burke. The numbers here are higher than Asheville, which has a much higher population. But after that Last Reformation event, it should sky rocket. I hadn't heard about that event. Thanks for posting!
This group just posted a YouTube video of their little event up there. Dang!  Now that is surely a superspread event in action. Hundreds enclosed in a tent, jammed together, no masks, shouting and cheering.  Here.  [https://youtu.be/JOOJ6LNU6jc?t=57](https://youtu.be/JOOJ6LNU6jc?t=57)
Bring up the [Chicago superspreader article](https://nypost.com/2020/04/08/possible-chicago-coronavirus-super-spreader-linked-to-15-cases/), too. Who wants a party where 15 people get sick and 3 die? AND they're all in your family.  Here's another fun one from today: [[30yr old] Patient dies after going to COVID party](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/patient-dies-after-going-to-covid-party-thought-it-was-a-hoax-official/ar-BB16CCy8?li=BBnb7Kz). Great last words, too: > "Just before the patient died, they looked at their nurse and said 'I think I made a mistake, I thought this was a hoax, but it's not.'"
> What stands out glaringly to me is that people gave it to co-workers...how? Why don't these businesses have safety guidelines in place?  Because this is the United States of America. Where most workers are expendable and the company they work for doesn't care if they live or die as long as the bottom line is met.
I am an essential hospital worker. All of the people in my department of 40ish people are constantly within less than six feet of another employee. If one of us gets it, we are all screwed.
Maybe don’t go.
If the N95 masks are not fit tested, you might as well have a cloth mask on. Is the reception outside?
I hope this doesn't come off as shitty, but why wear gloves? Unless you change them every time you touch something, they really don't protect you/others at all and just make you less likely to wash your hands. It's better to not wear them and wash your hands or use hand sanitizer between touching things and before touching your phone or face. And I second what has also been said here by others, you can't just go get tested (yet) unfortunately, I'm pregnant and my partner had a potential exposure and I called multiple testing sites in the Triad area and all said I had to have symptoms to get a test. I was told this is due to there not being an abundance of tests, they need to keep them for symptomatic folks.  Also getting tested the next day is also not a great idea as that's not really enough time for the virus to replicate enough in your system to be detectable. There's debate about how long to wait but average incubation time is 5-7 days, and tests are more accurate once symptoms start (i.e. less likely to get a false negative). It's so hard to truly stay safe!!
Just a heads up, you can’t go get tested on a whim like you can for strep/flu/STDs. You have to meet criteria such as showing symptoms of the virus AND having been in direct contact with someone who has had a laboratory confirmed case or living with someone who has tested positive. Otherwise you will be advised to self quarantine and monitor for symptoms, even if you do meet such criteria they may not order a test until symptoms reach a certain level of severity.
You wouldn’t test positive in one day. Wait 5-7 days before testing after potential exposure (unless you’re symptomatic before that).
We don't have enough information to prove or disprove this. Personally, I don't think children should be test subjects for a study on how contagious or harmful it is to them.  Also, the state just started tracking outbreaks at schools and child care facilities two weeks ago. In order for it to be reported to the state, the facility must have at least 5 positive cases. Plenty of kids are positive.   https://covid19.ncdhhs.gov/dashboard/outbreaks-and-clusters
Check upper right. Looks like 9 yo gave it to grandparents who gave it to neighbor.
We WANT people who are healthy and able-bodied to get the disease and recover.  That is how herd-immunity is built and that is the exact science behind vaccines (a portion of the population develops antigens to a disease, herd immunity is developed, and more fragile people are protected).  Only immunocompromised people should be quarantining or taking added measures.
I work in public schools. They had us “pool Together” our remaining Clorox wipes and Purell to “share equitably” between classrooms. It’s a laughably small amount.   I wouldn’t call our school staff lazy - mostly overworked. We (currently) can only afford two janitors a day (one during the day, one in the afternoon and evening.) They are responsible For cleaning 24 classrooms, plus all bathrooms, offices, common areas, cafeterias and gyms. It was big news last school year that our budget was increased so that they could pay our afternoon janitor to stay to clean the floor every day, instead of on alternating days.   All this - and no one on staff was responsible for wiping down tables or door handles or any high touch surfaces in classrooms.   Every teacher I knew wiped her own tables and counters and went through a box of Clorox a week.   But honestly I’m less concerned about the school’s ability to clean - that can be adjusted and improved. I’m worried about the number of points of contact between students, school bus drivers, teachers, cafeteria staff, etc.
Why are people still having weddings right now
I have no idea, but I would love to know.  The guy organizing it has youtube videos expressing that there will be "no social distancing" at his events and he plans to take this type of event cross country.  I have also been told by a few sources that he believes he is a vessel for Covid and is *trying* to spread it, but you tell a casual listener that and they disregard the whole thing as malarkey.   It disturbs me that it doesnt have enough attention - whether people just dont know or dont care.
No prob!  I have family who live up there and had the slight misfortune of driving through where the event was being held.  The stories my parents have about some of the crazy cult shit is both amusing and disturbing on multiple levels.
They and the Morganton News Herald have both been informed of what has been going on.  What they've chosen to do with that information is beyond me.
I don't particularly want to. I wish when they delayed it they had just delayed it indefinitely until this was over. But they didn't, and I'm making the cake, so I have to go.
Not true.  N95 means they filter at least 95% of particles bit it is usually more if fitted properly.  I had a coworker last week wear one upside-down for 8 straight hours, in a COVID hospital, doing vital signs on every patient there which was about 60.  She tested negative yesterday.  It will still provide better  protection than most masks, especially if you are outside.
It is an outdoor wedding, I don't plan on staying past the cake cutting but the food will be stored in a place with AC so I assume that it is inside.
I'm working on the cake, gloves are pretty much a requirement.
Some CVS/other locations have drive thru testing which is free and publicly available.
There are places in NC that offering testing for anyone with a risk factor, including having attended a large gathering. After diving deeper into research though, I'll have to wait at least 3 days before the test would be somewhat accurate and the false negative rate isn't stellar (only 80% chance to correctly identify a positive with symptoms, lower without them)
FastMed is doing walk in test, atleast in Raleigh. I'm not sure about elsewhere but I got one on Thursday and it was free with insurance.
This 100% depends on where you live.  I live in Greensboro and at least once or twice a week we have free, drive up, no appointment necessary testing that is back in 5 days for anyone who wants it.
I only said it was interesting. I’m aware of the flaws in the original statement by the CDC. I hoped that I was clear that I didn’t want to put anyone in danger. I have a kid going into kindergarten. Again, no links to the younger kids on this chart was interesting.
Yeah, that’s why I said “very young.” But I’m just going by the NYT report recently about it. I’m not sure they even gave ages, but that was a particular piece of MAYBE not terrible news. I certainly don’t know. Just hopeful, but definitely wanting everyone to do what’s safest for sure.
There is no herd immunity to this virus. In fact, there appears to only be a short term antibody response which means no long lasting immunity. There are already people who have contracted this disease twice. It is not like other diseases. Also, your understanding of how herd immunity works is not correct. In any case, herd immunity cannot be accomplished without a vaccine, notice that there is no natural herd immunity to influenza. You are not founding your beliefs based on facts.
> That is how herd-immunity is built and that is the exact science behind vaccines (a portion of the population develops antigens to a disease, herd immunity is developed, and more fragile people are protected).  A vaccine also prevents you from getting seriously sick. That's one of the selling points; if there were a sales brochure it'd be like #1.  Everyone catch the original ~~disease~~ virus to build antibodies is not the same exact science and does not have the same health impact.  > Only immunocompromised people should be quarantining or taking added measures.  Let's skip through it quick: you say that, I'll say "hospital overcrowding", you'll not care. Repeat tomorrow, ok?
Herd immunity works do well that the common cold and the flu have gone away.   You are an idiot.
I don’t think all staff is lazy, but just like the rest of the world, there are plenty of people that lack common sense or are lazy in every occupation. My husband had a principal call him because the phones and internet were out in the school. Ok, we’ll get on the right away. Turns out the problem was actually that the power was out in that area due to something that happened off campus. So they had no power but complained about the phone and internet service and never mentioned the power outage.
Probably because they've put down a lot of non-refundable deposits...    I would at least try to see if I could postpone it rather than risking the health of a bunch of people!
Because people still fall in love. My cousin was married just over a month ago, and she has been very smart about postponing the large family gathering to celebrate. At first, they pushed it back to August. Now they are inviting us next June to celebrate them. I'm really proud of her!  Edit- who is downvoting this?
Do you know where that guy's place is located? My mom is in Burke County so I wanted to see if his base of operations was near her but it only says "near Charlotte" and then lists a Danish address.
Oh that part makes perfect sense! I thought you meant just for the reception in general
You have to pre-book and good luck right now, the wait time is astronomical
Testing reliability is the biggest factor with walk-in/public testing, especially at places that guide the patients on administering the sample collection themselves. Just because these people have been “trained” to take samples for testing does not make them trained professionals. Like you said, the chances of false negatives is higher with less severe symptoms/less time since potential exposure, that’s why doctors and hospitals may not necessarily order a test simply for having attended large gatherings and a mild fever.   I got tested at Duke as part of pre-op procedures and there was a major difference in their setup and what I’ve seen from posts about walk-in testing.  If you think you may reasonably be exposed to the virus I would advise you to wear a face mask, practice good hand washing/sanitizer, and maintain social distancing. Afterwards you should self quarantine and monitor for symptoms and only seek out testing if symptoms become severe. I understand you want to make sure you’re healthy, but we don’t need the testing process to become overwhelmed. All of these places where people get tested, have to send samples to places like LabCorp or Mako; even Duke University Hospital sends off samples for testing.
I'm very surprised you were able to get one same day as the wait time in most of the state is terrible. Almost a week in Charlotte area
The link I provided shows children in child care facilities, the very young, in NC contracting COVID. This is only the last two weeks. This is just NC. Right now, we have over 9,000 kids ages 0-17 who have tested positive in NC. This is with schools closed, with many child care facilities closed or half full, and with very few summer camps open and operating. Children aren't immune. Even the very young.
Herd immunity has been accomplished without vaccines for thousands of years before vaccines were around.   Herd immunity has developed for influenza, it's just that mutated strains develop and the cycle of herd immunity has to start all over again.  But you are right -- even with vaccines, various new strains of the influenza virus still get people sick.   A virus is going to behave like a virus.
Herd immunity develops for all viruses eventually.   A virus is going to behave like a virus.
> A vaccine also prevents you from getting seriously sick  Eh...[not exactly](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/nov/28/polio-outbreaks-in-four-african-countries-caused-by-mutation-of-strain-in-vaccine).   Vaccines regularly cause people to get sick.  Everyone catching the original disease to build antibodies is called *organic herd immunity*.    The only other way to build antibodies or antigens is through *vaccinated herd immunity*.   Either way, a person is getting the virus, developing antigens, and developing immunity.  It's not that I don't care whether hospitals are overcrowded.   It's that across most of the country (except a few select places), it's [not happening](https://www.abc4.com/coronavirus/utah-man-with-covid-19-grateful-healthcare-system-is-not-overwhelmed/).
You seem not to understand what mutations are or how they work.
🤦‍♀️
What's love got to do, got to do with it  What's love but a second hand emotion
According to this thread:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/cults/comments/ebolgl/the\_last\_reformation\_living\_in\_my\_neighborhood/](https://www.reddit.com/r/cults/comments/ebolgl/the_last_reformation_living_in_my_neighborhood/)  They are out near South Mountain State Park. I remember finding a more specific location last time they came up, but I don't remember where. Last time I was able to pinpoint where they were on Google Maps. Very creepy stuff. The first time I heard about them there was someone claiming that they were going door to door in the Hickory area trying to intentionally spread the coronavirus. Not sure if that is true or not.  Edit: Was able to find them. You can actually just search The Last Reformation The Ark in Google Maps and it comes right up.  8355 Brookfield Rd, Connelly Springs, NC 28612
/U/calamityseye is correct. They got ahold of the old motel at Pine Mountain resort and that is what they call "The Ark".
Pine Mountain. Connelly Springs. Nearest Wal-Mart.....Morganton
How long has influenza been around? Name one instance of organic herd immunity to influenza. Can you state the differences between the influenza virus and SARS COV-2?
I feel bad for telling you this, but you are really just very confused and what you're doing is dangerous and pathetic.  Some sad idiot may actually believe your BS and die from adopting your idiotic stance.
From the article: > Type 2 is a wild virus that was eliminated years ago, but in **rare** cases the live virus in oral polio vaccines can mutate into a form capable of igniting new outbreaks of the disease.  "rare" instead of "regular" in that one case, at least. I don't know if us getting into vaccine effectiveness is going to make much difference. There's plenty of data on that, and we're still giving vaccines on the regular.  > [organic herd immunity vs vaccinated herd immunity...] Either way, a person is getting the virus, developing antigens, and developing immunity.  Just like liposuction and regular exercise both can help you lose 30lbs. The end result of -30lbs is the same, yes. I hope we both agree those methods are different and have different effects on the body.  > It's not that I don't care whether hospitals are overcrowded. It's that across most of the country (except a few select places), it's not happening.  I agree that every state does not need the same restrictions. But here is an article from this state (not Utah), from this week:    [NC health officials concerned by Charlotte-area hospitalization trends]( https://www.wbtv.com/2020/07/09/nc-health-officials-concerned-by-charlotte-area-hospitalization-trends/)  Basically, so far so good. But we can't let it get worse. It could get worse if everyone but the immunocompromised dropped all extra effort.
I do.   Name one thing herd immunity has eliminated without a vaccine.    I will be waiting.
Thanks for the heads up on the door to door bit. My mom is pretty leery of strangers, but she's in that general area and has friends who might want to have a heads up. Thanks for the info! Very much appreciated.   I had zero idea these folks existed. I tried to watch a video, but I couldn't make it very far. I'm not a religious person and tend to find that guy's, shall we call it enthusiasm(?), a bit hard to take. He's found a pretty good place for his message though. There a lot of fundamentalists in the area and the tent revival type of religious practice has been common there for decades. He'll fit right in.
Got interested. This place is 8 miles from my babysitters house. Very concerning
I just saw this YT footage posted today of their event- delivering from demons ?!  [https://youtu.be/JOOJ6LNU6jc?t=164](https://youtu.be/JOOJ6LNU6jc?t=164)
Ah ok. I think I know where you are talking about. I had no idea this was going on. I grew up near that area. The sad part is that revivalist types really have a prime audience in that part of the state. I am nosey how he found his way to NC. It seems like he made a beeline for that specific place from Europe.
I've shopped at that Wal-Mart many times.
Strains of influenza come and go...   - https://mbio.asm.org/content/2/5/e00150-11   - https://www.webmd.com/vaccines/news/20181130/what-herd-immunity-and-how-does-it-protect-us    Sars Covid 2 is a novel virus and influenza is not -- that has nothing to do with the fact that both are viruses, and that viruses behave according to a set basic set way of behaving. Both  are going to go through the population the way that a virus does.
HIV is a cluster of viruses, not a single virus.  Those who scream the loudest, fling the most mud...usually have no idea what they're talking about..  HIV cases are down 23% from previous years and the disease is slowly being reduced via vaccines, organic herd immunity, and better lifestyle choices.
Smallpox has been statistically eliminated.
I feel bad for telling you this, but you are really just very confused and what you're doing is dangerous and pathetic.   Some sad idiot may actually believe the anti-science position you're espousing, and believe that this "spooky" virus is different from "all other viruses" and adopt your stance.
Plague.  Look -- it's obvious you're not serious and not writing in good faith.   You've no historical frame of reference and no scientific frame of reference and are just lobbing questions because you genuinely have no clue what's going on and need somebody to provide answers.
I don't live in Burke County and all the information I've found is on reddit, Facebook, or rationalwiki. Also, there's really not much to go to the authorities about, as far as I can tell nothing illegal has happened yet.
From what I have heard, he left Denmark because he was being persecuted for his religion (nevermind the accounts of child abuse, among other things). He claimed asylum here in America.  Torben moved to CA and then went on his countrywide search for the "Ark".  He found the hotel for sale here in NC, (the previous owners were also trying to turn it into a church), and claims God had brought them together. He has a video on YouTube of that story and all I could do was facepalm.  There is a full rationalwiki page if you're interested in the rest of his whackadoo antics.
I asked you to name an instance of organic HERD immunity to influenza. The article describes antigenic drift and emphasizes the fact that there is really no ORGANIC herd immunity to influenza. The second article supports my statement that we cannot expect even poor level of herd immunity without a vaccine. You proved yourself wrong, did you even read the articles?   Your belief that we need to all catch SARS COV-2 and endure COVID 19 is founded on a pile of crap. Herd immunity does not work how you think it does, viruses do not all spread the same, HPV, herpes, norovirus, MERS, SARS are all distinctly different in how they propagate and the symptoms that result.   What you are saying is ignorant, dangerous, childishly irresponsible and stupid.
The science clearly shows distinct differences between SARS COV-2 and Influenza viruses. They spread differently, pathology is different, the death rate is different. The immune response is wildly different. You are spreading lies and disinformation. You are demonstrably wrong. Then you stupidly played *i'm rubber you're glue* and copy pasted my statement.  I still feel sorry for you, I hate making a person feel stupid, but man just stop, you are making yourself into an idiot here.
There is a plague vaccine, Jesus Christ you are an idiot.
Ah ok CA to very, very small town NC makes the slightest bit more sense than just "let's build a cult in the sticks of NC". Maybe I'll get bored enough one day to check out some wacky antics, but for now I think I'll pass. But I really appreciate the information. It's kind of mind blowing that all that is going on right here, but I'm sure crazy stuff is happening everywhere and people just don't know it because we don't run in those circles.
Facepalm.
You've produced not one shred of evidence to substantiate your claim that this "virus is different from all other viruses"...you just want (like the media overlords you are parrotting want)....to promulgate wild claims and for everyone to go along with them.  The main thing that is "different" is that this virus was given gain-of-function capacity to make it more virulent.  Beyond that, it is a virus, like other viruses.   Sorry...some of us still believe in facts and evidence.
The plague was effectively eliminated from Europe WELL BEFORE VACCINATION EVEN EXISTED.  It's almost like you've no background in history beyond the last century.  Ad hominem & ignorance is not an argument.
There is, but I'm sure the authorities are aware of it already since it happened a week and a half ago. I have no special evidence myself, just what I've seen people post about the group online.  Edit: Also, knowing law enforcement's attitude toward coronavirus restrictions in this part of the state, they probably know but chose to do nothing.
There is an overwhelming amount of scientific evidence demonstrating the differences between this virus and other viruses. I'm not wasting my time looking it up for you. You are parroting Trumpist propaganda.  By the way, you just said there was no evidence to substantiate my claim that this virus was different. Then you said >The main thing that is "different" is that this virus was given gain-of-function capacity to make it more virulent  You also said that I was parroting the media (like they want me to), but then you said the virus was different which means you are parroting the media now?  Then you had the gall to mention facts and evidence...LOL.  Your statements are openly contradictory, delusional and paranoid. Your first sentence has 2 false statements,  the second sentence contradicts the first and the third contains 2 false assertions in that you believe in facts and science and that my stance is opposite to facts and science. Try again liar.  You're kicking your own ass like a trump worshipper. Tell the truth, you're a Trumpist aren't you? And that's why you're saying this crazy shit right?
It didn't go away though. They still had cases until the vaccine was developed.    Do you want Covid-19 around for 500 years and to have a billion people die from?  You are only talking about herd immunity because you heard it somewhere.   It's not a thing without a vaccine.      Per Wikipedia  "The Black Death of 1346–1353 is considered to be unparalleled in human history. From 1347 to 1665, the Black Death is responsible for about a billion deaths in Europe. The third plague pandemic, which originated in China, results in about 2.2 million deaths"
Holy TDS.  No one's mentioned Trump here, I certainly haven't.   Only scientific research.   I'm sorry scientific research offends you.  Take your TDS somewhere else please and get help.
You do understand that "gain of function" means it was made more virulent, but that the basic structure is still that of a virus, don't you?   It still functions as a virus.
>They still had cases until the vaccine was developed.  Newsflash:  they still have occasional cases, even *with* the vaccine.  By and large, however, plague was eradicated organically.   Sorry facts offend.
You are arguing that we need healthy people to get SARS COV-2.  That is not a reasonable conclusion based on any scientific evidence. The only idiots that I have encountered so far making that dumb-ass argument are Trump worshippers.  Other countries have succeeded in overcoming this virus. It was not the result of ORGANIC HERD IMMUNITY or vaccines.  Go learn how that works and stop pretending that you are reading or that you can understand any scientific publication. It's clear that you neither read nor comprehend the articles you are citing.
You do understand that if it is MORE VIRULENT than other viruses that it is DIFFERENT and therefore NOT THE SAME as other viruses don't you?    Also, what is the basic structure of a virus? LOL.  Please define what a Corona Virus is and get back to me when you understand why it's called a Corona Virus. How many types of Corona Virus are there? Can you describe the differences between a Corona Virus structure and an Influenza virus structure? The name CORONA VIRUS is literally a direct reference to the distinctly DIFFERENT physical structure of the virus. Good lord you are dense man. Please stop embarrassing yourself.
So you just proved my point.  Herd immunity isn't really a thing.
I’m beginning to think this profile is maybe a Russian troll from the Internet Research Agency.   Surely nobody is actually this stupid?
It is.  A couple of new strains popping up, don't mean that immunity wasn't achieved on an earlier strain.
After reading your comment I read some of the comment history from this person.  I mean, the whole thing is just a bunch of wacko statements. Unfortunately mental illness/delusion etc can make a real person think like this, but I agree that it is confounding to imagine that any sane person could actually be that stupid. The only rational conclusion is that they are trolling, or mentally unwell.
So herd immunity doesn't work.    Once again you are so close to understanding but still don't get it.
You don't seem to understand what the word "strain" means.
I do.   Are you implying that covid-19 doesn't have strains.    Keep on pushing the herd immunity, it's not going to work but atleast will give you something to argue about.

Report: North Carolina ranks among the top 25 in the world for worst coronavirus outbreaks

I wouldn't be surprised if we got a nice boost from people driving down to Myrtle.
I had someone look at me the other day and tell me I'd look better without my mask on!!
[It's ranked 34 among American states for most deaths at 14 per 100,000](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1109011/coronavirus-covid19-death-rates-us-by-state/) (the highest is NJ, with 174 per 100,000)
It did not have to be this way.  Zero leadership, ignoring science, quack cures, drink bleach, no mask endorsement , alternative reality lies, threats, politicizing masks, denial of facts, Tulsa fiasco, white power tweets, diverting government funds to cronies, sowing divisiveness, reducing access to health coverage, slowing down testing, and on and on and on....   Who does these types of things in the face of a global pandemic?  It does not have to be this way.  Vote them out in November.
Can we get this on an NC license plate instead of the lies they make you chose from at the DMV?  ~~First In Freedom~~    ~~First In Flight~~  ~~In God We Trust~~  25th In Coronavirus √
Yet people still go around without masks and pretend it's nothing to worry about!
How are they even thinking of opening schools in what, 6 weeks? Release inmates from prisons, but throw children & teachers into this virus headfirst? This can’t be ok with people, & we have to push back to the idiot sociopath in chief that his re-election based on “the economy” does not include sacrificing children.
If we try harder and ignore more simple things we can be number 1.  Yes!
"we are planning on going to phase 3 now. Starting tomorrow, because why not."
I’ll take a wild guess that there are a lot of red states on that list...?  Yep.
We are hearing about some tortuous deaths, people in comas, and how a patient can go downhill extremely fast with this thing. Now, most recently, it has been established that the virus literally creates blood clots leading some doctors to call it a vascular vs respiratory illness. Here we are about 5 or 6 months down the road and doctors/researchers are still trying to nail down the full profile of this illness.  Sooo you still don't want to wear a mask? You still want to give ^ to another person? You want this thing to stay in our general population indefinitely?
We were #17 several weeks ago. This article isnt sharing anything new. This info is widely available on the Johns Hopkins COVID tracker.
Well that’s just great
And despite this my work is requiring overtime since we've been closed for a few months.
Sadly school right down the road got the busses together. Well we will see what school put money first before children’s wellbeing’s and what parents who do not care about their children’s lives. It’s all going to be out in the open now.
Among the top 25 of... what? States? Then why would you say "in the world" if states only apply to the U.S.?   This title gives no metric for context. Smells of fearmongering.
Of course we do. That’s because we’re stupid.
And Cooper won’t get an ounce of criticism. Instead we criticize Republican governors whose states don’t have nearly as many cases as New York, New Jersey, and California etc.
Is that the new "you'd be pretty if you smiled more?"
In Vacation in Virginia atm, had a guy laugh in my face for being "Dumb enough to wear a mask"
A virus is going to behave like a virus.
Bottom half, oh yeah.
It will take awhile for the death rate in NC to reflect the number of new outbreaks.
I was just in NJ. A disturbing number of people were wearing masks below their noses. I didn't want to be there, but I was out of food. Ran so fast out of there I didn't even get any dang sweet corn -_-
Only that chart is not for "most deaths".
The list is long as hell and it grows so fast every day it's impossible to keep track of the corruption. We are finished. If we even have elections in November I will be surprised and if they are not completely corrupted I will be surprised again. I really don't see an end to this ride.
What? My boss said its just a flu and we need to get back to normal, fuck remote working they need to be able to spit in my face when they want to because that's what they're used to damnit.  /s
“I will be not be muzzled!” -idiots
Don't think of the lives of children or teachers, think of the profits as risk by lifeless corporations.  Corporations are  "people" who do not believe that health of the populace is superior to the growth of profits.  Just ask Dan Forest.
Schools play a huge role in social services for poor students. Meals. Education. Haven from abuse.   Reports of child abuse are down enormously because teachers are often the most likely person to report neglect or abuse.   Although there is no one size fits all plan, the AAP is advocating for a return to school.   We have to be safe about how we do it, but it needs to happen.
I think it will literally kill the maximum number of people in the US possible. I think we are going hell for leather for 100% infection rate. We are a stupid, stupid, stupid place.
Read the article and you’ll answer your own question.
I agree with you about the title. It was my first question. Reading the article didn’t really answer it.   Sad and interesting information, nonetheless. I’d just like my news with a little bit of context.
Well this is just incorrect on a lot of fronts. So let’s try to refine your point a little. Who would you like to see criticizing Cooper that isn’t doing so and what actions were or we’re not taken that deserve said criticism?   Edit: spelling.
Given that his Lt. Governor Dan Forest is trying to boil him alive for not throwing a giant "We Love The Corona Virus" parade while enacting a Mask Burning Policy, I'd say Cooper is doing all he can with a Death Cult working against him.
What do you think Cooper should have done that he didn't do? It's also pretty obvious that dense cities are going to get hit hard no matter what.
It has more to do with [people like this](https://old.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/comments/hq1pfb/from_twitter_north_carolina_this_woman_refuses_to/) than anything Cooper has or hasn't done.  It comes down to personal responsibility for yourself and others.
Haha yeah. Houston has rows of refrigerated trucks for the corpses. Arizona is testing at nearly 1 out of 3 people tested as positive. Yeah, the dumb ass southern republicans are getting flat out exterminated by this disease.
I live in VA and that’s kinda typical unfortunately.
That happened to me in Charlotte last week.
For once it's nice to be ranked in the bottom half.
The number of patients in ICU beds has been pretty flat, which I don't think is consistent with an increase in cases that will result in death.   [https://www.newsobserver.com/news/coronavirus/article243796812.html](https://www.newsobserver.com/news/coronavirus/article243796812.html)
You went all the way to New Jersey for food?
There is no sweet anything in New Jersey.
It is deaths per 100,000 sorted by amount. I'm not sure what you mean.
“I’m not gonna live in fear!” says the unmasked CCW holder with an arsenal who never goes to ‘the city’ because of supposed rampant crime
but muh freedumbz
> Haven from abuse  As foster parents we've received more requests for placement this season than all of 2019 combined :(
The AAP based some of their recommendations on a 2016 study. I fully agree students were happier and healthier in school in 2016.   There is no information available on what it may do to students to force them to stay separate from their peers and teachers while in constant fear of contracting a potentially deadly virus. Teachers will be forced to stop students from trying to connect with each other all while wearing masks, face shields, and constantly sanitizing their environments.   There will be no socializing in the hallways or at lunch, no partner/group work, no teacher sitting down beside them to help them, no teacher redirecting them quietly or in private if their behavior needs to be addressed, etc. Hell they can't even lend each other a pencil.   If we go back, school will be unrecognizable. I wonder what the study on the effects will look like especially for young children. As an educator, it's very concerning.
Every argument I see about why schools need to meet in person rather than online has little to do with education and more to do with systemic inequalities in access and health. Those same children who need to eat, need to be free from abuse, and need child care will be sent to school sick out of necessity and will continue a cycle of infection in poor communities. These communities have already lost the highest number of people to the virus in NC. Schools being open for in person learning will only continue a cycle of death in those communities. It isn't the schools' job to fix our societal problems. They are here to educate.
Sure, but let’s get the numbers decreasing, not skyrocketing like they are now. Force the powers that be to be held accountable in using our tax dollars for relief, support, public education on how to fight this, & a plan to move forward. The Orange Mussolini never had a plan, & his accomplices are just as inept.
I'm more so trying to point out the nonsensical semantics of the title. People hit share (or upvote) on articles based on their titles alone without reading the actual article, so the content of the title ought to be accurate and not misleading.
Find me one criticism of Cooper on reddit.
Do you believe we should have shut down earlier and enforced masks earlier?
The Deaths per million numbers from last week:  Blue states  * NY = 1,663 * NJ = 1,748 * MA = 1200 * CT = 1200  Red States  * TX = 105 * FL = 187 * AZ = 280
I was in the area and hungry. Sorry I'm from the northeast and was kind of lurking in your subreddit. I wanted to see how everyone else is doing.  And yes, NJ has a surprising number of farms if you avoid all the places with... toxic waste. I went there because that store tends to get produce from local farms and stuff is better the less it travels. I didn't count on all the dumbasses. But it is Jersey after all.
Yes.   It's deaths per 100,000.     The focus of the chart is simply reporting numbers.    NC is nowhere near the top.
Omg watch this one https://youtu.be/eCuJFk8h2ss
Numbers are increasingly linearly in NC. This is bad, but not as bad as in Florida or Texas.   Like I said, there is no ‘one size fits all plan’. What we do here will be different than what Texas and Florida do.
The content of the article is accurate. Read the article and click the source chart they link.
Not sure why you’re getting downvoted, because you’re right. The NYT chart breaks it down by cases per million people, with US states and other countries mixed together in the same rankings. The entire country of Brazil, which has 225,000,000 people, is listed as one entry. I’m sure if you separated the states in Brazil, NC would fall further down the list, for example. It’s just kind of an arbitrary ranking system. Maybe we should rank them by city, then my town would be in 50,000th place or something and everyone would feel better?  Also, I saw this NYT article and chart when it came out - about a week ago - which was only right after the mask order went into effect.
TBF, it is against the rules to editorialize the titles.  The issue is more with the way that cbs17 wrote the title.  But, I do agree that it doesn't make sense without proper context.
Agree, but I mostly wanted to say I love your user name
This is from seven hours ago and took a grand total of 12 seconds to find. Now your turn to answer my questions.    https://www.reddit.com/r/NorthCarolina/comments/hpav1l/when_is_cooper_making_the_school_announcement/fxovyjy/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf
Shut down no, masks yes. The main goal of a shut down is to protect our hospitals, which we so far achieved. We clearly should have been talking about masks earlier, but I blame the CDC for that.
Total numbers here:  https://www.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#cases  Looks like dixie is about to have a hickpocolypse. Them numbers don't look good Cletus.
Yup. Outside the Turnpike corridor NJ has lots of farms, and forests.  Don't tell anyone though. There are too many people in that state as it is.
That is what I was trying to convey.
They weren’t criticizing the poster, I don’t think. Just the person who wrote the article.
Thanks lol it's my favorite flavor
Golly gee, I stand corrected! Congrats on changing someone’s mind on the internet. Enjoy your dopamine hits, honey!
We were one of the last states to shut down. If Cooper were a Republican then I’m sure you’d be singing a different tune on both the shut down and the masks.
I'm sure you can't wait for them to die off.
There is a metric. It's listed on the chart linked in the article. The title is completely accurate as per the data in the body of the article.
Yes, let's focus on  ^this ^little ^thing ^here  rather than  #THE POINT
Agreed. I am not downplaying the seriousness of covid 19, but very simply the chart is a mix of states, countries and territories and has no defined criteria on what is an “area”. While it shows a rise in those areas the data is sufficient to be used for comparison. Poor data pools is one of the reasons people are not listening. There will simply be another article that defines areas differently to show another set of data.
The world bro. Right below South Africa.
Please shut the fuck up, only point I’m making....
I mean, you asked him to find one.  not to mention that you still haven't answered the above question?  What is cooper doing wrong here?
Well bless your heart! I’m glad I was able to get through some of the noise! The internet can be so challenging that way, but it’s super encouraging to see someone use critical thinking skills when presented with facts. And not only that, be willing to change their mind when their stance is challenged. You don’t see if often, but it’s a beautiful thing when you do!
I feel like you are projecting here. In general, I think the liberal mindset regarding the virus is ridiculous. For example, I think there are zero problems with people going to the beach.
Here is some reading for you while you bow prostate in front of your shrine to Donald Trump.  https://www.wfla.com/news/florida/shame-on-you-protester-interrupts-coronavirus-update-accuses-desantis-of-doing-nothing-as-florida-cases-surge/  Enjoy, your Trumpy day.
The NYT chart is fine, but the title of this article still should’ve specified that they’re comparing NC to foreign countries.  By itself, “top 25” doesn’t really tell you anything.
I appreciate the effort that you put into formatting.
They aren’t saying it to contradict the point of the article, they’re just saying that it’s a poor title. That’s allowed.
Thank you, you stated my thoughts in a more eloquent way than I did. Comparing divisions of a country to other complete countries is a strange way of conceptualizing data. You could frame data in any way that serves your bias if you get to arbitrarily decide what is considered an "area" without remaining consistent across the board.
SA has started schools up fully
Chill
Do you believe we should have closed down earlier and enforced masks earlier?
Your lack of a response proves my point. Bunch of cultists who are incapable of criticizing their daddy, Cooper. No different from the Trumpists.
Congrats on not being like the rest of the cultists in the  hivemind.
It's almost like you cultists **want** moderates to vote for the GOP. Doesn't seem like a very successful strategy for winning elections.
The title literally says "top 25...coronavirus outbreaks"
 Not in the mood this evening. Sorry.
Dude, just answer the question.  It's laughable at this point. lolol
Lol. Moderates will not be voting for the cultists of the GOP. Stop projecting your behaviors on others.  Hey did you see the great republican success with reopening in Arizona?   https://www.fox10phoenix.com/news/arizona-covid-19-cases-rise-record-hospitalizations-seen1  Doing great. It's all just a hoax. The hoax was made in China. It the same as flue but it's China hoax which exists if we talk about China but it's fake if we talk about the USA lol. WTF is wrong with you Trump cult people?
But the list of top 25 subnational regions is going to look very different from the list of top 25 countries + US states.  We made the top 25 of one, but that doesn’t mean we would’ve made the top 25 of the other.
Then don’t comment.
You're now essentially arguing that the content is flawed when you previously stated that the source and content was fine but the headline was bad. So which is it? Stick to a platform.
Cool
No I’m not. I’m still talking about the headline.
No, you are not. Because you are stating that a different list would look different, which has nothing to do with how the headline is worded and everything to do with the body and substance of the article.
Right, I’m saying that the headline is bad because it’s ambiguous and doesn’t give you a very good sense of what it’s actually reporting on.  You have to open the article and then click a link to a separate article by the New York Times to really understand what they’re saying, when they could’ve just said “top 25 countries and US states” in the title.  It’s a little nitpicky, I know, but I think it’s a valid complaint by OP and I wish people didn’t dogpile onto them for it.

North Carolina sets single-day record for coronavirus hospitalizations

Huh.  It is almost like we don't have this under control.
Here is exactly the problem - the tag on this post is "political". You can't vote for or against the virus, so stop trying to take that frustration out by rebelling against health and safety precautions.
And we’re still on track to open schools? I think this is just going to throw gas on the fire but if someone said we can’t keep people isolated forever I wouldn’t know how to rebut that point.
Anyone happen to know the average percentage of ICU bed availability pre-pandemic? Hospitals are businesses and they aren't making money on empty beds. Is 22% availability drastically lower than normal?
Hello mods? Why is there a “politics” tag on an article that is literally reporting the data of how many Covid hospitalizations and cases there are??
People do realize that this number will continue to rise until several days if not weeks after our daily cases start dropping, right? The daily "new record hit" is just numbing at this point.  No one cares anymore and nothing is shocking.  Wear your mask and consider donating some food to your local COVID unit nurses, trust me, they need it.
I wonder if that figure of 1 in 10 people tested positive were from symptomatic patients.
Y'all, I work in a lab and let me tell you: we are fucked.  When I started a touch over a month ago I was the only one wearing a mask 100% of the time. Two other people would wear it when they were "close" to people and even then one of them doesn't put it over their nose.  Everyone else doesn't wear one and congregates like it's no big deal. Fast forward to today, a *few* other people have begun wearing them full time. However it's still 90+% don't wear them and are in groups with little to NO space between them.  When people in science start not giving a fuck, you know there is a fundamental problem. Y'all I'm fucking terrified how bad this really is going to get.
Nailed It.  /s
Congratulations! You did it! 🙄
Dear stupid idiots,   In case you did not know this, you are in a serious emergency.  Thanks,  Zeezurvivah.
Good news, there is plenty of capacity.  People getting care.  Beds are open, lets give folks the best we can.  More hospitalizations does not mean deaths door intubated ICU for everyone.  Some people are getting other, non C19 related, surgeries.   https://covid19.healthdata.org/united-states-of-america/north-carolina
Now that you can eat in restaurants people in my town wander around freely without masks even more than before.  Most people in my area act like it's completely fake and literally just some Chinese conspiracy to undermine Trump because he is so hard on them.
At this point it will be less annoying to post when we don't set a record.
I expected no less.
In latin Tarheels means Beautiful land of  dunderheads .
we never did
Interesting, bc I certainly didn't put that tag on here.
Yeah wtf. A viral infection is not political.   Any mod want to give a reasoning?  Edit: Thanks for changing the tag.
Probably done automatically due to the source of the article.
I must be missing something.  I have no kids. I don't teach.     Opening schools right now seems like literally the dumbest fucking idea I could imagine.  It'd be on par with allowing concerts and sporting events.     Someone please tell me what I'm missing
We wouldn't need to keep people isolated forever if everyone would be responsible, considerate of others, and wear a mask as well as go into public only for necessities.
if everyone would wear a goddamn mask it would not be forever, it would be like two more months. WEAR. A. MASK.   https://www.axios.com/cdc-director-masking-coronavirus-dba00f19-4167-43a0-b021-9a9e66974517.html
To be fair, none of the public schools are being allowed to go back at full capacity, and districts can still choose to do entirely remote learning if they choose, and any individual student/parent can choose all remote as well (I think I saw 11% of Wake county students have signed up for all online in the last 3 days, more to come I'm sure). But there are other factors involved, especially for elementary-aged students, that systems are trying to balance.
While I don’t recall ICU % I know typical hospitals run 70-80% and from my understanding the numbers we are given are from traditional hospital beds and doesn’t include overflow areas that hospitals have ready.
i wonder about this too.  i wonder how many hospital admissions are geared towards the bottom-line rather than someone actually needing to be admitted.  like you said, hospitals are businesses and i'm sure the initial lockdown hurt their revenue rather hard.  so i wonder how much of these admissions are geared towards recouping those losses.  i hope the doctors are the ones making these calls and not the administrators.
It was an accident, they’ve fixed it now. I thought the exact same thing so I sent them a message and it was changed to “news” right after.
It's a trigger warning for the snowflakes who get riled up when asked to think critically, engage in scientifically-based reasoning, or just be decent neighbors capable of empathy and care for others.
Well stated and good point. Thank you.
I got the P-EBT card loaded with over 500 bucks of 'food stamps' without asking for, or needing itm due to my kids qualifying for reduced lunch at school.  I'm looking for a food pantry to give on an epic giant donation to, and also what would get the biggest / most nutritious / shelf stable bang for the buck.  I'd prefer non religious based orgs if possible, but it's not a deal breaker.  I'm in south durham.  Also, how would one go about donating actual food to covid nurses without risking spread (EBT won't order pizzas)?
>I wonder if that figure of 1 in 10 people tested positive were from symptomatic patients.  Most likely.  Asymptomatic people likely aren't looking to get tested.
I also wonder how much is from people getting tested when they come into the hospital for other reasons.
That's a great and valid question!
That is scary, in a lab no less! I had to go to an elementary school just two days ago and was shocked that all three office workers weren’t wearing masks.
Sounds like the management or leadership at your lab is terrible. I work with scientists and it is mandatory that you have your mask on and everyone has been good about following the rules.
It’s the truth. It’s scary.
And this, kids, is how I met your mother... FUCKING NIGHTMARE!!!  Thanks for the lab insight too!
Wait, so theyve not been wearing mask, and they haven't gotten sick? Huh. Maybe this has been over hyped to death.
Lmfao! 🤣 This sounds like it comes from a benevolent alien based on the username.
Sounds about right for the state... unfortunately.
Yeah but, ya know, gotta raise that awareness.
Haha ikr? Don’t get me wrong, I’m as concerned as anyone (I’m T1 diabetic), but aren’t most states seeing record numbers of cases and hospitalizations since things started reopening? The exceptions seem to be states like NY, IL, WA, and MI, where they had massive outbreaks early-on and already set their records, and states where the population is extremely spread out, like Wyoming, Montana, and the Dakotas. It’s not really surprising, considered most places have reopened non-essential businesses, is it? It seems inevitable rather then especially newsworthy.
Sounds accurate.
Yes - i apologize if it sounded like I was saying that was your fault.
Mods, tell us!!!
The website is The Hill.
School is free daycare. Beyond that, kids will be harmed by missing a semester/year of in-person school. Many kids don't have computers or access to reliable internet. Even if they do, remote learning just isn't as effective as in-person instruction, especially for younger kids.  That doesn't mean we should charge full speed ahead with opening schools, but there's a serious trade-off here.
The Federal government is also trying to strong arm the states into opening the schools back up.
People have to work and cant if their kids are stuck at home indefinitely.
Wrong choice of words. Instead of forever the word should be indefinitely.
There is a segment of the population that never will. From a local post today about Walmart's face requirement:  "I'm frigging tired of other people trying to keep me safe by adding restrictions to my life....They can KMA."  "Sheep following the others to the Kool aide Vat to be fed a big spoon ful of bull. Keep believing everything they tell you."  "NO WALMART, NO AMAZON IF BLM .ORG IS THERE CAUSE THEN I CAN'T DO BUSINESS WITH COMMUNIST."  I can't facepalm hard enough. I'm also not entirely sure what that last person was trying to say.
Where is the data showing that if everyone wears a mask the virus will disappear in two months?
To add to this; Up to 20% of wake county school students now applied at virtual academy (numbers from Jul15th).  Still climbing.
Admission decisions are made by front-line clinicians. Administrators may get involved if there are capacity issues, but nobody is trying to get revenue back by admitting people who don't need to be admitted. That wouldn't make any sense because the ED and admissions from ED are typically money-losers, not money-makers. Abuse around admissions generally comes in the form of hospitals trying to push people away, not bring them in.  Elective procedures and outpatient visits are the real money-makers. That's what hospitals are focused on getting back to get revenues back up.
Cool - thanks for sending the message!
The things they really need are easy, individually wrapped snacks, drinks and waters, smaller portion the better.  Think something you can eat in the time it takes to pee since that would be the only reason to fully doff PPE, otherwise they are gowned up the rest of the shift, except for a 30 min lunch.  If you have a donation you can call the hospital and ask for volunteer services or something similar and they will likely come out to collect them from the car for you.
I think this is why infected person tracing is important. If you've been exposed, and currently asymptomatic, you need a test and isolation.   This would be a case where asymptomatic folks are getting a test. And they should def. get a test.
Why does that matter?  its still a person with covid.
I was in the ER over the weekend and they didn’t test me. The ER Dr wasn’t wearing a mask either.
That's where you're wrong buddy, we've had attrition already and are skeptical about more.  Edit: 130k dead also doesn't seem overblown to me, but hey what do I know
> The exceptions seem to be states like NY, IL, WA, and MI, where they had massive outbreaks early, and states where the population is extremely spread out, like Wyoming, Montana, and the Dakotas.  Michigan is actually very similar when it comes to population and density compared to NC. They just opened slower with more restrictions, which is the case for most states that are not seeing the big spikes southern states are seeing.   Georgia, SC and FL opened quicker and before NC and they have even more issues than NC.   Unfortunately there is a huge risk listening to leadership that cares more about the economy than safety.
I messaged the mods and they fixed it, accidental flairing. Thanks mods!
Looks like they changed it to news....
This is an incredibly complex issue. Where before you could argue with the ReOpen nc people over wanting to eat in a restaurant, it’s hard to fault people who want or need schools to open. But also, understand the people saying we can’t possibly open schools. But, I don’t see how a single mom of 3 can function as a teacher and work from home. Much less, having paying her unemployment for the whole school year and expect her to make enough money to survive. I don’t have the answers.
The Federal government is/was attempting political extortion against state and local school districts by withholding funding if they didn’t open. The thing is, the president and his band of fools didn’t know they don’t have the direct power to do that.
Then extend unemployment...  Or cancel mortgage/rebt payments
Oh...I was just repeating your verbiage.
Does it fucking matter? Wear a goddamn mask. It's not hard. Not everything has to be fucking questioned like it a grand goddamn conspiracy. This shit is so tired.   Wear a mask. If you don't your not just an asshole you're literally endangering your life and others. I'm fucking sorry that I actually give a shit about not only my life but YOUR life. Hence I'm saying to wear a mask. This isn't fucking hard.

thank you very much for this information.  i hate that my mind goes there sometimes (business decisions rather than what's best for someone's health), but you just never know.  thanks again.
Yup, after kid number 2, the hospital suggested we stay 2 days after birth (born early AM saturday, stay next 2 days sun/mon as well).  Wife was like, nah, i got this fam, it's my second kid, show me the 'don't shake the baby' video on sunday, and we're out(no complications for wife or kid).  Saved us a bunch of $ and the hospital was cool with it too.
I'm just interested in the numbers, that's all. I'm also interested in the number of asymptomatic people as well as data on antibody testing.
That doesn't sound right. Every local hospital has a universal mask policy for anyone in their buildings. You should let them know.
If you weren't tested then your experience was the exception, not the rule. I personally know several hospital workers and they all are saying incoming patients are supposed to be tested for SARS-CoV-2.
I'm not suggesting people aren't dying. I'm well aware this is a real virus with real consequences for vulnerable people, and that it can spontaneously be devastating to people who aren't high risk. But the Herculean effort that has been made by individuals (not the government,  on either side really) is beginning to grow tiring. I wear my mask, I keep my distance, but I'm tired of my job being as busy as it is, and I'm tired of not being able to go and relax when I'm not at work because everything I want to do is closed or limited access.
Michigan had their spike early on.  1.6k cases per day and multiple 200+ death days.  We have been steadily increasing since then but were no where near that level in April.
What I meant about Michigan was that Detroit was one of the worst affected places in the country during the initial outbreak, so their numbers spiked early and I don’t think they’ve technically been breaking records like the southern states have for that reason. Similarly with Chicago, NYC, Seattle, etc.. Id bet NOLA is a similar case in the south, although I haven’t looked at their numbers in Louisiana recently.
You laid that out perfectly.
Literal acts of congress
Some parents don't qualify for unemployment because they're able to work from home.  Juggling work and childcare is a challenge (to put it mildly).  Parents are tired, and I'm seeing more and more where employers are getting tired of remote work.  I know some friends have taken a calculated risk to bring a childcare person into their home so they can have uninterrupted work time.  It's a rock and a hard place.  None of which justifies opening schools... just commenting on all the layers of shittiness for teleworking parents in particular.
How? What happens to the taxes that landlords have to pay? What about the banks or independent agents that give home loans etc? What do we do when places aren’t willing to give out loans because the government can just forgive them whenever? Where are these unemployment checks coming from if you cancel the taxes for landlords/rentals/homeowners? Higher sales tax? More tax on people actually willing to work? It’s not as easy as snapping your fingers and canceling debt. Other things happen because you canceled that debt
I meant that I made the wrong choice in wording.
You're my spirit animal.
Calm down, I do wear a mask and have been since May.
I miss going out too buddy. Fishing holes have been great to me lately.
Right, it seems NC and a handful of other states actually were successful in keeping the curve low enough to not overwhelm medical services. The key is can we continue to do that over the next month with all the anti-maskers running around and schools opening?
Thanks! I have a kid about to start kindergarten, so I’m very mixed. Fortunately, I’m in an ok position with a flexible job, and plenty of family support to make it work. But not everyone can make it work. I honestly have no idea how this isn’t going to be a disaster for a ton of people.
I'm aware, I worked remotely for 3 weeks before being let go.   I also have a 5 yr old at home, it's not easy but its doable.    Employers need to understand that it is a rough situation for everyone and to expect more breaks/less productivity while being at home with no childcare alternatives at the moment.
> What happens to the taxes that landlords have to pay?  Idk bro maybe those landlords should have learnt how to code   vOv
Oh gotcha. My bad, friend.
I spend all day out in the heat, it's not where I want to be in my time off.
Where I live schools kids are only going to school 2 days a week at half capacity each day. So at least for my area I'm not worried about spikes from schools opening. That coupled with the low mortality rate of people under 20 and the transmission rate being so low as to be called "rare" between children and adults makes me feel OK with the school situation.
We also have a rising K and 3rd grader. Unfortunately both my wife and I work full time (she’s looking for work currently) so it’s almost impossible to find a job with so many unknowns. Meanwhile unemployment has taken 7 weeks so far and we’ve seen nothing. It’s a mess.   Hope it goes well for y’all! We’re trying to remain positive 😀
I'm not sure that your 3 week experience with your specific job speaks to the experience of all parents in that situation who have been, and perhaps will be doing this indefinitely. Add to that multiple children rather than just one. My job pays enough that I can afford a nanny, but if I couldn't I'd be dead in the water.
I wasn't implying otherwise-- only that extending unemployment and canceling rent/mortgage payments doesn't solve the problem for many parents, so opening schools will continue to look attractive for a myriad of reasons.  For many, it's not doable to WFH and parent, but you're right: employers *should* be more understanding.  Unfortunately, not all are.  I'm sorry you were let go.  Have you been able to find other work?
he's your bad friend?  or it's your bad, friend?  https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61Isqmvwc3L._AC_SY879_.jpg
I get it. Everyone has their own definition of Eden.
They way I see it:  School started to burn, all kids got out.   Fire gets worse (way worse): Okay send them all back in.      Why? because it costs too much to keep them home?  &#x200B;  I'm fine, my mortgage is only 600/monthly so even if I have to work minimum wage id be okay, luckily unemployment is enough.
Good point. Edited
That works for you but not for many of us. I have 3 school age kids in grades 2, 6, and 8. I have been lucky in regards to my wife being at home and helping them stay on track with their schooling. But I know for a fact that my son has slipped some in his math no matter how hard I have been working with him. So I would love them to go back to school with the hybrid option.        Edit. I was talking with a coworker about this because he has three kids in school as well. He also knows for a fact that one of his kids will do worse in school if it is all online. But there is no other option unless we pay out of pocket for a private school (which isn't an option for my coworker and I).

Coronavirus live updates: Here’s what to know in North Carolina on July 15

I'm not sure why staying in Phase 2 is the right plan since it's seen the worst growth of the virus so far. I do believe, though that it's time for people to stop looking to the gov to add restrictions and start to hold each other accountable. Everyday if you can't answer these questions, there's a problem: what am I doing to reduce the spread? What is my family doing to reduce the spread? How am I holding others in my community/friends accountable for reducing the spread?  In the Northeast they had a lot more restrictions, a more detailed phase-plan, enforcement by law enforcement, and community members holding each other responsible...I don't think we have any of these things so far and clearly, we're not getting better.
> I'm not sure why staying in Phase 2 is the right plan since it's seen the worst growth of the virus so far.  I imagine it's because NC isn't the 'worst' unfortunately when compared to other states.   There likely is very little political willpower left to be able to shut down the state a second time without basically people being piled up in the streets.   If kids are going back to school and people don't think wearing a mask is going to help, then getting them to start staying at home again isn't going to happen.
Totally agree. Def not saying we should add that level of restriction, but we have to be a bit more surgical...perhaps limiting alcohol after 10p will help, but breweries allowed to have huge crowds of unmasked people in a group probably also should be examined...esp after at least 2 closed for infections (Sycamore was closed also for a bit, but seems to be open again already...may not have been related).

Task force report says NC, 17 other states in coronavirus 'red zone' should roll back reopening

What comes after red zone...brush fire? Because I think we’ll be looking at that a few weeks after schools are reopened.
Sorry we're gonna take the Mad Max Thunderdome route instead.
In a statement released today the White House stated that it's happy to hear so many states are in the Red Zone and the President hopes they can score touchdowns or at least salvage a field goal.
No, let's just go ahead and reopen the schools. That'll fix it. /s
It will be the Frozone morgues that will be needed as we will see our morgues overrun and we will require refrigerated trucks for the overflow.
touchdown, though Cooper might just settle for a field goal.
*shotgun pump* This. Is. The. TarHOOOOLE!  *crowd cheers*
It's a home run! The best goal EVER!
They call it the red zone because of the red flags.
GOP wants you to send your kids to school before the "all clear" but they will not attend their own convention in J-ville, Fla.   Crystal clear hipocracy.
That's going to make great ads.
Yep.
Ah, yes... we should all stay home and feed off governmental unemployment. We should make families struggle and rely on the government for a 0.00015% chance of dying. Watch out crossing the road or swimming in the ocean.
> for a 0.00015% chance of dying. Watch out crossing the road or swimming in the ocean.  That is, of course, not a proper or accurate way of doing a risk assessment, as you have to look at your risk of contracting the disease and then the subsequent risk once infected of dying and dying isn’t the only risk.   Further, due to lack of testing, as well as likely under reported deaths, we really don’t know the true mortality or infection rate, nor have we even reached the peak, which makes this cavalier attitude towards the disease even more nonsensical.  One thing that is kind of interesting about this cavalier attitude is that those who don’t take the disease seriously are likely at a higher risk of contracting and subsequently dying or suffering long term health issues from corona, specifically because they are less likely to take proper precautions...like pushing to send kids back to school as numbers are rising. This makes the shoddy soggy napkin statistical analysis even more absurd.
You probably already feed off the government anyway.
Your child's school has 1,000 students and a pack of wild wolves have inhabited it over the summer.  No one cares enough to wait to remove the wolves before sending the children in.  Only One or Two of the children will die a terrible death but another 100 or more will be severely injured.  Let's send *Your children* in the very first group.  I'm sure they'll be fine.
Complains about "government unemployment".  Also needs the government's schools to babysit his kids.
Thanks, glad we agree and you think so too! Keep on keeping America great, brother!

Nearly half of all Wake County's coronavirus cases are from Latinx community

I’ve gotta feel that a pretty big reason is that many Latinos work jobs considered to be essential.. construction/food service etc... so a significant portion of the population isn’t able to stay at home
>essential.. construction/food service etc...   This is happening nationwide; mostly younger workers in essential jobs getting the (vastly) disproportionately amount of Covid cases. But most people (it seems) think that young people are getting Covid from beaches, bars, and parties, when it's really from these essential jobs.   Just look at this latest post in the Raleigh sub:  https://old.reddit.com/r/raleigh/comments/hu0ydc/the_rockford_last_night/  -People are not paying attention to where and how these Covid cases are really happening, from the essential jobs. The people who work these jobs (and their families) are being treated as "invisible" during most of this, and that's a shame.
This is likely true to some extent, but one thing I found interesting about Durham County's stats is that about [25% of our new cases (around 125 of 475) last week](https://durhampublichealth-durhamnc.hub.arcgis.com/datasets/ea94109a53734aa38025bd3bf7ff2f7d) have been among unemployed people, a trend that's been happening the past month or so. Construction and hospitals being the next two most frequent occupations is less surprising.
i have worked everyday in my essential position, but i wear a mask and wash my hands and watch the news to stay informed.....they have the same opportunities/resources as i do. saw a bus of fieldworkers at the local store...20-25 grown men, no masks at all

Pres. Trump calls off RNC in Florida, citing ‘flare-up’ of coronavirus; North Carolina events still on

I look forward to his apology to Roy Cooper.
What? Is he referring to:  The Chinese virus made by China which is the democrats fault but which is a hoax and it's fake, that isn't killing people and and just gives them a sniffle, and which we need to test for less because the numbers are too high and,,,which doesn't exist because, and no RNC in Florida because...  That Coronavirus? Is that the one he's mentioning? It's gone like a miracle he said, but no RNC in Florida because of the non-existent virus, and he and the whole white house staff gets tested multiple times a week for a virus that's a hoax and shut down the white house cafeteria, because the democrats or something.
But, back to school kids!
didn't want people making fun of shots of a quarter-full stadium
Screw that orange douchebag
Flare up? Idiot he knows that no one is going to come and it will be him standing in an empty room.  Jackass
This is what happens when a game show how host is elected president. the nightmare continues.
HA HA HA HAHAHA!   What a maroon.
I bet Roy laughed his ass off at this
I look forward to seeing how his supporters spin this.
I think the irony is so many complaining about Cooper saying 'no' to Trump, and now Trump is cancelling in Florida for the very same concerns Cooper had. Even better is Charlotte still makes money due to the contractual agreements put in place.
The kids need to get back to school so they can be doctors and scientists. Then we can just ignore them too.
The Republicans just want to use this to shift funding from public schools to private schools. Trump said exactly this just yesterday.
Ultra-maroon
*"To have a big convention is not the right time,” President Trump said of Jacksonville.*  Are you saying Trump is lying?
Stop lying. The article has the words straight from Trump's mouth.
So is it that the President of the United States has so little influence that he can't convince his own party and a governor of his own party to preserve the event that he fought tooth and nail for?    Or is he just so incompetent that he didn't realize that inevitably the event he fought so hard for and raged so strongly for would have to be terminated because of the short-sightedness and cruelty of his party's handling of the coronavirus?
Since when did Trump not do exactly what Trump wanted to do even if a state wanted otherwise?
Trump said on live TV yesterday during his briefing "I've instructed my team to pull the plug on the convention in Jacksonville"
According to someone in this very thread:  "Correction: Florida called it off due to logistics."
It’ll probably be ignored
Heh. Looks like it was — shocker — deleted.
Is that what we're calling the virus now? Logistics-19?

NC ranks at #31: Death rates from coronavirus (COVID-19) in the United States as of July 24, 2020, by state


A North Carolina private school reopened amid national concerns over in-person classes. Days later a staff member tested positive for coronavirus.

What did they think would happen? People+respiration+enclosed environment+hang time of virus+slow decay rate of virus in air=high likelihood of additional infections.  That math seem right? Or was I supposed to be using the same math Betsy DeVos uses when coming to conclusions that kids are the Kryptonite to the virus?
Idiots, and they're still going to continue after disinfecting the teacher's room. Somehow this happening within the first week of their opening wasn't a strong enough wakeup call that this is a terrible and irresponsible decision.
So what?
Why wouldn't they name the school?
Yes, and it is expected from them. This school and philosophy is blatantly right-wing, and it is why these parents choose the school.
Are you aware that the whole "flatten the curve" strategy was never designed to reduce infections to zero.
Or. That teacher would have got covid anyway and was out at a bar the week before. Can we confirm this teacher got covid from school?  Are we never having school again?
They did, Thales Academy Raleigh.
>Thales Academy, a private school   They did, in the article below the bullet points and ad.
I am aware of that. I think bringing a group of people together who are prone to unsanitary behavior and unable to understand the consequences (the school children) are able to create a spike in the curve by spreading it amongst themselves, teachers, staff, parents, grandparents, and the rest of the population.   Forcing teachers and staff to risk their health and the health of their loved ones is unnecessary and unfair. Even if they are healthy and/or low risk, their are known effects from Covid that include longterm or permanent negative impacts. If they or their loved ones are at a higher risk, they are susceptible to those negatives effects at a higher rate and worse impact.   It's not only the teachers and staff, it's also the parents, relatives, and anyone else in contact with any of them who may be severely impacted (including the students even if most of them are asymptomatic).  I think these conditions have a high likelihood of causing superspreading events which could lead to dramatic spikes in hospital visits and negative impacts to a large percentage of the population.   Edit: Rephrased a couple sentences.
Where did OP say the intent was to get zero infections?   Hell if people just wore face masks and stayed 6ft apart, you'd get the R value far below one and COVID would likely burn out with only small pockets popping up. You know, the whole idea of the shutdown in the first place. Turns out too many people are ignorant and don't care how many die, as long as they have the 'freedom' to do whatever they want.
Do you feel like we have achieved success?
Perhaps we can't confirm that the teacher got it from the students, but we CAN confirm that those kids have now come into contact with someone who had it. And each of those kids goes home to parents and siblings. And while we don't know exactly the effect COVID has on kids, we do know the effect it can have on their parents and those their parents come into contact with.
Where the teacher was infected isn't what matters. The potential of causing a superspreading event is what matters. The likelyhood of this occurring with students is very high since they are more likely to be asymptomatic, more likely to be unsanitary, and less likely to understand the consequences. They are capable of spreading it amongst themselves and to teachers, staff, parents, and relatives who are capable of spreading it even further.   This is on top of the fact that the teachers and staff are being asked to put their health and the health of their loved ones at risk which is unnecessary and unfair.  Edit: Added a word.
Thank you. - Not the 2nd glass of whiskey speaking.
Yes? Our hospital system wasn’t overwhelmed, that was the goal
What about every other job where people are forced to go to work? Is that fair? If you don’t like the risk of your job then find another job where you don’t have to take that risk. There is also no reason a teacher has to come within six feet of the students and should also be wearing a mask.   Are we just never going to have school again? I think all healthcare workers shouldn’t have to work because it isn’t fair
The goal was the keep deaths down and hospitals from being overrun, and both are breaking in many areas of the US. Unfortunately we haven't even made it through the first wave yet.   It's paramount that we all get on the rid ourselves of COVID very quickly, before kids go back to school and before the next flu season.   If not, the cycle of open close open close will begin again.
Wasn't? What you mean to say hasn't so far. This isn't over by any means.
>Are we just never going to have school again?   So hyperbolic.
I strongly disagree.  As I said in my previous comment: "The potential of causing a superspreading event is what matters. The likelyhood of this occurring with students is very high since they are more likely to be asymptomatic, more likely to be unsanitary, and less likely to understand the consequences. They are capable of spreading it amongst themselves and to teachers, staff, parents, and relatives who are capable of spreading it even further."  Students will spread it amongst themselves  then to parents, relatives, friends, and so on to coworkers and many others.   Also, it is not possible to keep students 6 feet away from teachers. Kids will try to hug and touch their teachers. They will want to show teachers their work. Students will run up to their teachers to show them something or to tell on another kid. Students will touch their teachers and get within 6 feet of them just to get the their attention. This will happen multiple times every single day. Kids cannot adequately control their excitement or understand the risk enough to prevent the spread of this.   They will cough, sneeze, and pick their nose then touch everyone and anything. These behaviors cannot be controlled by a teacher nor can a teacher prevent exposure to themselves or anyone one else with any preventive measure readily accessible to them or their school.  I am very grateful for the healthcare workers helping to fight this as well as the risks they are taking. They also have equipment and measures to minimize exposure and spread. Schools do not. Returning to school will increase hospital and other visits which will exasperate resources and increase risks to healthcare workers as well as other essential employees. Most essential employees are primarily working with adults in environments that can take active measures to prevent spreading Covid (although some refuse to unfortunately). Schools cannot reliably do this with children. Kids will not be able to control themselves enough to prevent spreading this, and there are not realistic ways to prevent them from doing so.  Edit: Fixed typos and formatting after messing them up on my cell phone.
Being as this is /r/northcarolina I think “we” can be interpreted to mean North Carolina. To that end i would say that yes the first shutdown accomplished the stated goal of flattening the curve and preventing our hospital systems from being overwhelmed as was feared back in March if exponential growth took place and I don’t think its even a particularly controversial statement to make despite the DV
How is that exaggerated. This disease is never going away. We go to school during flu season every year and there are plenty of older teachers at risk during that time.   I was unaware that school has become so pointless we can just cancel it
> first shutdown accomplished the stated goal of flattening the curve  Many don't agree with that, as the curve isn't down.   Per [John Hopkins the 'curve'](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/new-cases) is defined as follows:  *"Flattening the curve involves reducing the number of new COVID-19 cases from one day to the next. This helps prevent healthcare systems from becoming overwhelmed. When a country has fewer new COVID-19 cases emerging today than it did on a previous day, that’s a sign that the country is flattening the curve."*  When the curve was supposed to go down, it was supposed to stay down. Has that happened in NC? Not at all.   A measured, cautious, reopening with support of small business and individuals would have kept the curve down, and yet now it is climbing, just in time for kids to go back to school and flu season to start again.   That's why it's important (and why the state is) taking multiple factors into consideration, not just hospitalization metrics (which are still unfortunately climbing).   Now NC has gotten to the point that our [average deaths are at](https://www.newsobserver.com/news/local/article241168731.html) a similar level they were at the 'peak' of the virus, which is even more concerning, since death is the most lagging factor when it comes to COVID.   Hopefully the % positive cases keep coming down, but it hasn't been under 5% for a single day since NC started mass testing.   So no, we haven't been successful in NC in any measure of success, we have only tamped the 'fire' down slightly.
Teacher here.  That's an extreme oversimplification of the situation.
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0j1ZXEeQAI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0j1ZXEeQAI)
That’s the point. It’s very simple. Wear a mask and a faceshield and whatever other ppe you want and go to work
That is not a realistic solution for everyone.

Set in response to coronavirus, DMV deadline extensions are scheduled to end Friday


Coronavirus: North Carolina late-night alcohol sales restrictions

This gives me the impression we won’t be moving on from phase 1.5 on the 7th
Is this actually going to be enforced? I'm already hearing rumblings of places ignoring it. Some bars have been open for weeks now, claiming "restaurant" status
This doesn't do anything for rural counties in NC, which are among the highest (per 10,000 residents) for Covid cases. This is just for show, as people going to bars gets a lot of attention on the news lately.  https://covid19.ncdhhs.gov/dashboard (see County Map by Cases)  https://indyweek.com/news/northcarolina/covid-19-meatpacking-plants/  >The data show new or ongoing surges of infections in 14 rural counties with significant meatpacking operations, including Sampson, Wayne, Bladen, and Duplin Counties—the state leaders for pork production, which together employ 19,000 workers. **Twelve counties with surges are also ranked among the highest in the nation for Covid-19 cases**. In addition to the four above, they include Burke, Chatham, Randolph, Johnston, Robeson, Rowan, Sampson, and Union Counties. Two others with smaller caseloads but new spikes are Surry and Wilson Counties.  >As of June 26, at least 2,772 meatpacking workers had tested positive for the virus in outbreaks at 28 plants, according to a spokesperson for the N.C. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS). But health officials will not report the locations of such clusters.  Focusing attention on bars/restaurants, means people won't ask questions about where cases are really happening, and continue to happen
Makes complete sense, I was hopeful the cutoff time (looks like its going to be 11pm statewide) would have been slightly earlier, and enacted a bit sooner.   Hopefully this won't need to be in place long, as the numbers for the state are still pretty darn high, they at least seem to be stabilizing, which means we might be getting over the worse of this and on a a declining trajectory very soon.
Fucking brilliant more business slashing at some restaurants just barely staying afloat
Cooper keeps taking things away and giving nothing in return. Such a sad sight to see.
I can think of quite a few private clubs that are more responsible than your local Wild Wings.
We’ve been in Phase 2 since May 22nd.
ALE loves to swoop into bars late at night for alcohol violations. I'm sure they've got the biggest boner over this right now.
This would probably get 'enforcement' through reporting to ALE, which just means those businesses would get their liquor licenses revoked. Not something those places want to mess with.
I saw that a bit when we first entered this Phase 1.5 back in May, but those were stamped out pretty quick, at least here in Charlotte. We actually had one bar bring a gas grill and put it out back to serve burgers and hotdogs, but they got shut down for that.  Just curious, do you know of any bars/restaurants in Wilmington doing this? Asking for a friend...
I'd be interested to know what you consider a bar vs a restaurant. Businesses don't just get to randomly choose there are criteria to meet. Like as long as food is thirty percent of your sales you count as a restaurant in NC
I almost actually agree with you.   What additional regulation could be placed against meatpacking plants to reduce COVID spread?   Every meatplant in NC has refused to allow DHHS to put testing stations near plants to get an accurate number of cases to enforce additional restrictions. DHHS also gets no regulation oversite for meatplants.   Even at the federal level there has been a strong push to keep these plants open due to meat being so important as a product in the United States.   If you remember, reddit threw an absolute fit when COVID relief for NC included $15 million for ['animal disposal' due to the small](https://www.newsobserver.com/news/business/article242944156.html) number of plants that needed to be shut down due to COVID.   Closed meat plants = animals being discarded. We aren't talking small numbers either. Chickens account for 40%+ of NC's total farm revenue, to the tune of over $38 billion per year. [There are easily 50 chickens in NC per person](https://www.feedstuffs.com/news/north-carolina-poultry-numbers-rise#:~:text=North%20Carolina%20is%20now%20home,as%20well%209.7%20million%20hogs.), and at least 1 pig per person in NC.   Meat is massive here, and the workers are being screwed and infected with COVID and due to massive businesses that own them like Smithfield and Tyson, there is little the state is going to be able to do, especially with such backlash when any sort of regulations are put into place.   So once again, we all suffer as big business gets to do whatever it wants.
It does a lot of prevention for the colleges that are about to fill their dorms up in the next two weeks, though.
As long as they still plan on letting schools re-open then we are nowhere close to the end. This order will help a little, but students going back to school soon will undo any gains made because of this.
If your business is that reliant on alcohol sales to stay afloat (such that stopping after 11pm is going to kill your business), it is likely less of a restaurant and more of a 'bar' which shouldn't be open under current safer at home orders in the first place.   I cant imagine any sheriff that wouldn't enforce this rule, as it may have the added effect of decreasing late night drivers with alcohol in their system.
I'm sorry, but if people can't be responsible then they'll have to be governed. It's that simple.   No job. None. Is worth people dying. Seriously. This isn't a hard fucking concept.
>Cooper keeps taking things away and giving nothing in return  Cooper can't pass legislation and while he does have authority to regulate some things via executive order, it is somewhat limited.  I think our legislators are more culpable here, as they have the opportunity to pass legislation that would help bar owners, such as some sort of financial aid or perhaps changing the law to allow take out drinks\*, but instead they just pass laws that strip the governor of his power and force things to reopen.  Then, when that inevitably gets vetoed, they go back to hiding in the corner, content with the fact that their supporters will think they are doing something, when the sad fact is the only thing they've brought to the table is #reopen.  \* I think at least one of their vetoed #reopen bills sort of did this, but they also included language that would prevent Cooper from shutting things back down if necessary, which as evidenced by the liberal governors in Texas and Florida, along with the slow ineffective leadership of our GA, is a great idea during a pandemic.
Would you really like to be Georgia or Tennessee or South Carolina or Alabama or Florida or Mississippi right now?     We’re doing better than all of them because he’s not giving in to pressure.
It’s a modified phase 2 that has more restrictions than originally planned for phase 2, hence the 1.5.
Time to defund the ALE!
Couldn't tell you anything about Wilmington, sorry
I live in Wilmington. No “bars” are open but if you serve food you can serve alcohol I know a lot of bartenders in the area that say not all places will follow this I guess we will see how ALE handles it.
I just went down the permitting rabbit hole yesterday. In addition to the 30% rule, you also have to have a kitchen and indoor dining area.
It doesn't do anything for young people not in college, that work essential jobs; who are the ones who are **vastly over represented** (per state and local public health data) in Covid cases.  https://www.newsobserver.com/news/coronavirus/article244545857.html  >In April, a worker at Pilgrim’s Pride poultry processing plant in Sanford called workplace safety regulators to complain that the plant wasn’t notifying employees when other staffers tested positive for the coronavirus.  >A few weeks later, a worker at a Smithfield Foods pork plant in Tar Heel called to report that the plant wouldn’t allow workers to wear masks.  >In early July, a worker at Tyson Farms in Monroe reported that the meatpacking company had “reinstituted the point system for absences” making “employees feel that they are being forced to work, even when they feel sick.”  >**The N.C. Department of Labor, the agency charged with investigating most workplace health and safety complaints, has found no safety violations at any of the plants and issued no citations or penalties. That’s despite repeated complaints raising the same issues – lack of social distancing, insufficient personal protective equipment and workers being forced to work even when they’re sick**.  -So Cooper goes after these restaurants, (who are an easy target) while failing to protect people who work at the meat plants
And all those kids are totally not going to throw normal Ass parties and gatherings.
I mean bars and restaurants just can't pick a classification either you serve food or you don't. If people aren't following capacity or social distancing rules then they are the ones that need to be shut down. Not everyone
> Simple facts  I thought people were primarily getting Covid cases through their essential jobs, like at [meatpacking plants](https://old.reddit.com/r/NorthCarolina/comments/hzm9o4/coronavirus_north_carolina_latenight_alcohol/fzk5m6k/), prisons, nursing homes, hospitals, construction sites, etc.   How does alcohol restrictions help with people who are getting sick from their jobs? Just seems like window dressing to me
This is not 100% correct. The “restaurant” down the street is packed from 4p - 2a with people drinking, and few eating. Don’t blame the bars who only account for 15% of the alcohol permits in the state. A LOT of restaurants are behaving like bars and taking advantage of the situation.  I can think of quite a few private clubs that are more responsible than your local Wild Wings.
> If folks would just be more responsible, we could get back to normal a lot quicker.  Stop with this nonsense. We will be locked down as long as the governor feels like and not a second more.   Things getting worse? Need more lockdowns? Things stabilizing? Need more lockdowns. Things getting better? See, the lockdowns work! Let's keep doing them! When exactly does 'back to normal' happen? When there a literally zero COVID cases? Would we even open back up then?
You clearly don't understand what is required to be counted as a restaurant in this state. It has to do with sales percentages not your opinion of what is a bar or not.
Well glad to know you clearly have a secure job. Some of us rely on work you to pay for fucking rent and bills and groceries. If Tom Dick and Harry want to go get smashed at applebees and they end up catching and dying from covid because of it, I really don't give a shit anymore. Like maybe it's time we distance ourselves from the fuckheads who keep breaking common sense rules and not wearing masks and keep spreading this shit? I don't want to end up homeless because Karen refused to wear a god damn mask so we shut everything down again
No the rest of the fucking world is handling this like responsible adults/countries. Meanwhile we are babying motherfuckers who wont wear masks in public or follow social distancing rules. Fucking punish them. Not people relying on restaurant wages to not lose their jobs and thus their homes. Like if you are the type that doesn't follow the safety regulations and you get covid and die then fuck you I'll dance on your grave because it's on less fucking moron to keep this shit going.
No he isn't. He is just playing politics. He wants to look like he is doing something. His poll numbers aren't falling so why not shut more shit down? It has never been about flatting the curve, it is about control. Dragging this out as long as possible has been the goal since day one.
Contrary to popular belief, money does not grow on trees. Tax revenue is going to tank so there isn't any money to prop up businesses unless you want to cut school funding by a whole lot.   To go drink is a neat band aid which I would support but sadly won't fix much of anything other than allowing people to have a slight stronger roadie for the way home.
Cooper altered the deal. Pray he doesn’t alter it further.
Yep so it makes me wonder what people mean when they say bars pretending to be restaurants... Like any bar in my city that tried to pretend got shut down within days as soon as people found out
It does something for them, by helping to slow spread so when that essential worker gets into a car accident on the way to work, they have a chance to see a doctor.    **Helping one helps us all.**    What’s so hard to understand about that?  No, *one* action by the Governor is not enough.  But don’t pretend that taking one action means abandoning everyone else.  Or that only one action has been taken so far.   The actions work in concert.
>Ass parties
The big difference is that other countries actually took precautions and got it under control first. We are just now starting to see it level out. I really hope that it doesn't make things worse, but I don't really see how it couldn't at this point.
So you think bars and nightclubs should be allowed to open as long as they enforce capacity and social distancing rules?
There is no more normal, you fool!
> Stop with this nonsense. We will be locked down as long as the governor feels like and not a second more.  DING DING DING!
And you clearly don't understand why the EO is being put into place, so I am not sure what your point is.   The rule was already in place in Raleigh and Orange county and I don't see those businesses suddenly shutting down because they aren't able to make enough money to stay afloat.   Ideally its how Phase II should have been done in the first place. No on site alcohol consumption. Problem solved.
> I really don't give a shit anymore  I hope you realize that in your Applebee’s scenario, the bartenders and waitstaff you claim to advocate for would be just as likely to catch COVID and die. You’re making a huge fuss about these people needing to work at restaurants/bars, but at the same time you say you don’t give a shit if they live or die.
Who said anything about me having a job or not having a job. That's not relevant. No. Job. Is. Worth. Dying. Over. Period. End. Of. Story.   Yes. Wear a fucking mask. No shit. Yes social distance. No shit. But seriously if you think any job is worth dying over you're a fucking moron and missing the goddamn point.
Fucking thank you. I am sick of everyone getting punished because these dumbfucks can’t just wear a mask or social distance. The one or two times I’ve been out in public the mask “mandate” wasn’t even being enforced. As someone who’s been staying inside and wearing a mask and social distancing for the past 5 fucking months, it’s so frustrating seeing shutdowns get extended and cases rising despite me doing what I’m supposed to to help flatten the curve. We could’ve had this under control MONTHS ago like the rest of the fucking world if people here weren’t such fucking idiots.
>it is about control. Dragging this out as long as possible has been the goal since day one  This is one of the dumber takes on the pandemic, other than perhaps the Bill Gates/5G nuts.   It couldn't possibly be because we are in uncharted territory, with a horribly mismanaged federal response, around 650,000 dead worldwide, 150,000 of them being Americans, and numbers trending ever upwards.   Nope, it is just a conspiracy by the democrats to make trump look bad and drag things out until Novermber. /s  Whats interesting about this, in a sad 150,000 Americans died kind of way, is that had trump taken this seriously from the get go, we could have beat it or at least been far more open than we are now, he could have used it to push his racist border policies, stolen the spot light from the democrats, and easily cruised to a second term.
> To go drink is a neat band aid which I would support but sadly won't fix much of anything other than allowing people to have a slight stronger roadie for the way home.   WTF...  You can't you know, drink at home? I mean, it must be so hard to order curbside from a restaurant and have a drink at home.
We have billions in the rainy day fund, along with money left over from last years budget, because the NC GOP refused to do their job and negotiate with Cooper.   This is the time to spend it, while it is pouring outside and hundreds of thousands of American's are dying.  Just forcing things to reopen isn't a solution, but lets them virtue signal to their base.
I don’t know what they mean by that either. A better description would be restaurants that turn into bars which is fairly common here in Raleigh. After 11 they turn into full on bars with a bunch of desperate middle aged white people grinding to the greatest dance hits of the 70’s played by the same cover bands that have been around since the 70’s. It’s very odd that we’ve never evolved from that 😂  We did have a big issue with bars that added basic stuff for sale, like toilet paper, so they could claim they were operating a store front or selling bags of chips to qualify as “food”  Then we had the bottle shops who kept on serving drinks instead of doing carry out only.   I’m not saying all did any of these things but we definitely had a few that pushed the limits to the extreme.   And now, here we are months later, still in a modified phase 2, with more restrictions coming weekly because people don’t know how to behave.
Kids these days
I can think of late night places like Tobacco Road or Carolina Ale House or Tyler’s.  Definitely restaurants, but after 10, full of folks having drinks after getting off their own restaurant shifts.    But most of those places are corporate enough I’m not worried about them.
I think bars with capacity x or lower should be allowed to open. Nightclubs you're just cramming too many people into one small space then encouraging them.to grind on everyone. But there are a ton of neighborhood bars in my city that require memberships that could be allowed open on a restricted capacity with social distancing rules and it would be no different than restaurants. Hell the few I go to in my city were well ahead of at least the whole sanitizing and wiping shit down than most restaurants. And I'm talking like cheers style places. Not your bar Charlotte's or clubs on Franklin St.
Suspending basic civil liberties like freedom to peacefully assemble or freedom of association is a lockdown. Feel free to suggest another word that describes this and, if it is more accurate than lockdown, I will use it.  EDIT: There are other words to describe it, but it seems that "lockdown" has been the commonly used term and has had a relatively neutral connotation, as opposed to me using words like "tyranny" and "authoritarianism", which have negative connotations.
Yes the alcohol consumption is the problem our state is in such shit shape from covid. Not the beaches or people not giving two shits about masks and social distancing but the booze.
Actually probably not. They might get sick and while illnesses are spreading in pretty much all age groups deaths are still mostly in older people or those with pre existing conditions. Conveniently the group I see bitching about their freedoms and masks are also older people. So some Applebee's employees or any restaurant employee might get sick. But we are already taking that risk being open in general. So yeah we are risking our lives trying to make ends meet financially. Stopping alcohol at eleven isn't going to change that.
But muh haircuts and freedumbs
Lol buddy keep believing that!
Just saying what is going to happen.   You think people that buy tall boys at gas stations at Midnight wait until they get home?
The ones I'm familiar with in Greensboro like downtown yeah they served less food and people showed up just to drink but they never had bands or really anything other than background music. Mostly a lot of people getting off and sitting around having a few shots or beers nothing super crazy.
There have been plenty of protests going on in NC and no one has been stopping them.   Civil liberties are alive and well.   You just want to get drunk inside and get other people sick. That’s not your right.
You realize college starts next week, right?  That’s why.  Because drunk college students living in dorms will spread this shit like a forest fire on a California hillside.
I’m neither heavily right nor left, but idk how conservatives are still denying there are some huge issues here.  I keep hearing at work that there must be some sort of conspiracy because no other country is this bad any more, blah blah blah... OR it could just be because the response to this has been utter shite at the federal level. Far worse than any other first world country. And the numbers show it.
Sounds like a good study to conduct next year.   Feel free to track alcohol related incidents after 11pm for the duration of the EO and compare to recent years data and report back.   As for a more interesting comparison, see if COVID cases go down in the same amount of time.   Doing nothing in NC seems to indicate our COVID cases and deaths will keep increasing, so there is likely a lot of pressure to you know, do something, and with the data available, it seems places acting like bars may be a contributor to the increased cases and deaths NC is seeing.   If you were governor, what would you enact that you legally could and would lower the number of COVID cases and not piss of more than half the state?  Seems like you complain a lot about how the state is ran, but rarely offer solutions.
Yes, I am aware that protests had been allowed, at least as long as Cooper approved. Of course, reopen protests were stopped in Raleigh. So the fact that it is being arbitrarily enforced based on politics is supposed to make it....better?   Either way, the right to peacefully assemble and associate does not only cover political protests, just as the right to free speech does not only cover political speech, but any and all speech that is not a direct call to action.   > You just want to get drunk inside and get other people sick. That’s not your right.  Oh. Cool. So we're just going to lie about and insult each other. Okay then.   I guess that means you are an anti-social loser who is secretly happy about the lockdowns because you wish that everyone else was just as miserable and pathetic as you. And now you are glad because you can spend your day watching porn and playing video games while still thinking of yourself as a good person. Am I in the ballpark there?  In all seriousness, this is such an absurd and dishonest take about someone's position. It's the same logic as "If you don't want to ban all cars, you must want people to die in car accidents." I do not want to get people sick. I am, however, aware that there are thousands and thousands of diseases in the world that I could, unknowingly, be carrying at any time. Every time that I go outside, I am risking that someone I meet might have one of these. That does not mean that they wanted to infect me; it is just a natural part of life and one of the risks that I willingly accept in order to engage in society.
You realize most college kids drink at house parties and not bars right? Shits going to spread regardless , but not for the reasons Cooper apparently believes.
I think you missed my point. I was just saying that if you give people to go drinks they are going to roadie them home. Not everyone but a percentage.   I was under the impression that you don’t think people roadie drinks.
I want us to continue to be vigilant because I’m a doctor and I see people die of this every day at work.   I honestly couldn’t give a shit about how much you want to go to a bar or restaurant or not wear a mask.   It’s not your right to endanger other people’s health.
My only experience with how college kids drink is having both been a college student and also having worked as a bartender on Franklin Street. So I’m pretty fucking familiar with the fact that students jam pack bars every night of the week.    Of course it’s going to spread. The idea is to slow it as much as possible because our hospitals are starting to be filled by our neighbors that aren’t putting the brakes on at all.
The same people who would do that would just drink more at the bar before driving home under normal circumstances. We can all agree drunk driving is bad, but allows to go drinks isn’t going increase that. If anything, they would likely be less drunk while driving, if you’re comparing having 1 drink while driving to having several at a bar just before driving.
This isn't just about me not wanting to go to a bar or restaurant. This is about me acknowledging that my neighbors and fellow citizens have the right to be free, and I don't have the right to take that away from them just because it would make me marginally safer.  It isn't selfish that I want my fellow man (or woman) to have the freedom owed to them. It is a selfless understanding that they do not exist for my pleasure and are free to make choices that I might not approve of. If I want to avoid any risks that come with being near others, it is my obligation to stay home.  But if the standard that you want to use is that you cannot endanger anyone's health, don't you have to isolate yourself forever? Your mere existence is a danger to other's health, since you could be carrying any number of horrible diseases and not even know it! Do you drive to work, because you are endangering every other person on the road if you do? I know that you know that the standard you put forth is unworkable in any other facet of life, so what is so different now?
It’s obvious you don’t understand the basics of public health, and it gives me deep satisfaction that people like you are not in charge of setting public health policy.
If it were definitively true that my failure to wear a mask meant you would die of covid, would you support a legal requirement for me to wear a mask?
> basics of public health  I'm gonna assume you look at the local county public health stats for where you live.   Here's for Durham, where I live:  https://durhampublichealth-durhamnc.hub.arcgis.com/  https://durhampublichealth-durhamnc.hub.arcgis.com/datasets/77b3ecc6fad94b0d821cd6259afe1d11  >In July so far, the greatest number of cases (with known employment information) occurred among people who are unemployed, people working in construction, and people working in hospitals.  -When I look at the previous reports, I see that people who work in construction are vastly over-represented in Covid Cases for Durham County.  If restaurants (and bars attached to them) were really responsible for the rising Covid cases in Durham County, then how come people who work construction, are the ones mostly affected?   It seems like y'all are very selective on what to focus on in regards to policy, when it comes to the people who are actually getting sick.   It's pretty obvious (when you dig into the data) that people are *primarily* getting sick from their essential jobs, and not from restaurants which serve booze
Funny how I haven't mentioned masks in this entire thread. Wonder why you would bring those up?  However, to answer your question. Yes, as you would be a clear and present danger to people around you. I'll actually go several steps further on and say that, if you have COVID, even at the current death rates of between .26 and .6 percent, you could justify a government-mandated quarantine of those people until they get healthy. But the important part of that sentence is that it applies to **people who have COVID**, not every single person you might, possibly, have a small chance of having it.   If the government wants to take away someone's rights because they are a clear and present danger to others, they should be able to. However, the burden of proof should be on the government, not the individual being quarantined. The idea that we would impose restrictions on an entire population because a small percentage of them are *potentially* dangerous comes from the same line of thinking that gets us something like Stop-and-Frisk. Even if Stop-and-Frisk reduces murder rates, it is still wrong, no?
Wait, you mean essential workers going to work just as they always have are getting sick and....people who have been laid off or furloughed from a massively scaled back restaurant industry *aren't*?!  Man, that's a reeeeeeeeal head scratcher that one..............
To whom the should the government bear its burden of proof?
Whoever it does for other situations where you temporarily have to take someone's rights, so a court, I guess? I believe that is how Red Flag laws work as well, where you get a quick hearing to have your guns temporarily removed. In this case, all it would take is a positive test to confirm your 'guilt'
Where do ‘rights’ come from?
Nature, God, or Nature’s God, whichever you prefer. However you prefer to say it, they are natural and exist outside of government. This is the basis of the founding of the US and also the foundation of liberal democracy.

Coronavirus cases among children rise in North Carolina

I don’t know why NCDHHS hasn’t revised their mask order for kids under 11! Everyone over 2-3 should wear one. Cooper has it right about requiring kids K-12 needing masks if they go back, so why not apply it everywhere?
Fall and winter will be a nightmare in the USA.
And not just here in NC, of course.  In Florida, Child hospitalizations have increased by 23% during their recent uptick in cases over the past few weeks:  >On July 16, the state [of Florida] had a total of 23,170 children ages 17 and under who had tested positive since the beginning of the pandemic. [...] By July 24, that number jumped to 31,150.  >During that same time period, the death toll among children in Florida went from 4 to 5. [Among them, a 9-year-old girl with no known pre-existing conditions]  >it's not just the numbers of new cases and hospitalizations that are rising in Florida. The test positivity rate among children has gone up, too -- from 13.4% to 14.4% between July 16 and 24, according to the state health department. [source](https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/27/health/florida-covid-children-hospitalizations/index.html)  It is so amazingly reckless that some are pushing to reopen schools quickly, as well as asserting with such confidence things about corona, like children aren't carriers, when we don't fully understand the disease, it's long term effects, or how it spreads among children.
As someone who's a new parent this is fucking scary
I really feel for the mother in this story. Once with someone who they hadn't seen and who was probably asymptomatic was all it took. So many parents have become more lenient with social visits. Some have to go back to work so their children are in day camps and daycare. So many more will have to go back to school soon. AAP is keeping track of the data on children throughout the US: https://services.aap.org/en/pages/2019-novel-coronavirus-covid-19-infections/children-and-covid-19-state-level-data-report/
I saw this story come across the feeds today that contains some new data about kids and COVID  https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/30/health/coronavirus-children.html  Apologies if you've seen it already, but for those who haven't.
Cases are rising for the whole population, so of course they're going to rise in kids. This isn't surprising at all.
Not for mask fighting Patriots 😑
Yeah, I am worried that unless the percentage positive cases are way down by 8/17 and COVID starts spreading in the school systems that have not started virtually, its going to be yet another mess of closures and pissed off people.   We've had all summer to work on this and yet so many people just want to ignore, deny and blame 'the other side' for what is going on.
Day 8 over here. Terrifying.
> The study is not without caveats: It was small, and did not specify the participants’ race or sex, or whether they had underlying conditions. The tests looked for viral RNA, genetic pieces of the coronavirus, rather than the live virus itself. (Its genetic material is RNA, not DNA.)  Some information, but not really much there to make a difference. More about this virus is being learned all the time. We do have studies and observations from all over the world that have continued to see low symptoms and an _extremely_ low death rate in children, as well as schools operating in-person classes in Europe and other places without incident. No study has ever suggested that children don't get the virus or that their risk of death from it is 0%, but so far what we are seeing is that children by and large don't get sick nearly as often and don't seem to be transmitting it to adults easily.
CMS just changed to go all remote for orientation, my guess is that it won't be in-person until the Spring and even that's a little bit in question, depends on vaccine.   It does look like the overall percent positive trend is going down since we're at 7% now.
Everything was terrifying at that age. Both you and your kid will grow thicker skin with time. There’s no magic solution to it that anyone can tell you. That feeling of being a new parent is just something you have to live through.  This is gonna be tough but you will be ok. I remember how scared I was with my kid and I wasn’t also dealing with a pandemic. You’re gonna be tough as nails.
Day 18 here.  Doesn’t get better.
It, along with the other indicators, are enough to make it clear that this isn’t something we should rush into, nor should our children be guinea pigs for a disease that new things are being learned all the time.  One difference between some of the places that have opened up schools and the US is that, for the most part, they have a much better handle on the disease and a much smaller population, while we are still surging here.  If you look at Israel, who compared to the US, has a similar 7 day Per capita rolling average, although about half the overall infection rate and a much lower fatality rate, with a population similar to the state of Georgia, they’ve had a lot of problems with their schools:  > In Israel, where the virus has been surging again, schools at every level have been affected. By early June, more than 100 schools had been shut and more than 13,000 students and teachers had been sent home to quarantine. The most notable outbreak was tied to a middle and high school: The Gymnasia Rehavia in Jerusalem saw 153 students and 25 staff test positive. [source](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/schools-reopening-coronavirus/2020/07/10/865fb3e6-c122-11ea-8908-68a2b9eae9e0_story.html)  Pushing to open schools, with limited data and surging cases, is reckless and shows a callous disregard for the health and safety of, children, teachers, school staff, and parents.
Thanks... So far, things are going great. My instincts have been surprisingly good, and my wife is an all-star per usual.   But the long(er) tail of wondering about daycare and our jobs and things like that is scary. Then there's the whole idea of her getting sick and having life-long impacts (assuming she lives)...   We already had to have a group of guys in our house to fix our AC and I know their boss just recovered from covid plus who knows what other households they've been in.  It's a bit ironic because I have always been hesitant about new things so one thing I wanted to instill in my daughter was to just try stuff. But we certainly can't start her life like that right now!
We had to spend 6 days (pre/post birth) in the hospital. And that time was awful. I basically slept in my mask as the ac dumped air directly on me.   Then our AC at home broke and literally every AC company I reached out to had experienced some level of covid exposure but I had no choice but to hire one of them to have several guys in our house for a full day. They wore masks. I wore a mask, and my wife and daughter were sealed in a room alone.  But you just don't know. I'm far from a fear-monger or germophobe. But I want my daughter to be healthy. And I'd like for my wife and I to be healthy as well!
My personal stance on the matter is that more care should be taken to craft plans that get those kids that need it the most as much in-person instruction as is _safely_ possible. I also believe that the governor should have let each district handle it as best as they see fit, whether it's plan A, plan B plan C, or some mixture of the three.
This sounds so incredibly familiar. Good for you. Well the Covid thing is a nightmare but be careful and you will be ok. There will be enough things to fret over in your immediate life too so don’t get overwhelmed.  I wish I could take the advise I want to give. Lol. Be well. You’re gonna do great.
Actually the mother/baby unit at the hospital has been the worst of our experience so far.  We were only there 3 days.  Individually The nurses were awesome but as first time scared shitless parents with a kid we didn’t know how to feed we didn’t see them enough.  Plus when we did see them they were having to take out the trash or restock supplies for the room because the hospital removed CNA’s when it was sold to a private company a few months back.  Also, the lactation consultants were less than helpful.    It’s been much better since we’ve gotten home.  Awesome would be a good word to describe it. Figured out breastfeeding, with the help Of family, the first night at home.
Here are two other examples for you, just in case you really think opening schools during a pandemic is a good idea, which based on your original un-edited comment seems to be the case:  [Hundreds of Georgia campers infected with coronavirus at YMCA camp in just days, CDC report finds](https://www.wsbtv.com/news/local/hundreds-georgia-campers-infected-with-coronavirus-ymca-summer-camp-cdc-report-finds/EL5FFTVSDVETRGROPEXK6CIZNM/)  [Mississippi school district reports first case of COVID-19 during first week of school](https://www.fox13memphis.com/news/local/mississippi-school-district-reports-first-case-covid-19-during-first-week-school/ROMNVESIB5HCVEQYQA3JCWLLCY/)  If we push forward with opening schools, then this will almost certainly continue, until we have to shut them down anyway.   >I also believe that the governor should have let each district handle it as best as they see fit, whether it's plan A, plan B plan C, or some mixture of the three.  I believe that is more or less what he did. Schools were given the option to open under Plan B or Plan C. He just said they couldn't open under Plan A, because opening without any real changes during a pandemic is a dumb idea.  Edit:  Why did you edit your comment to remove your assertion that what happened to schools in Israel has no relevance to opening schools in the US?  Is it because it is a laughable argument to suggest that their problems in schools has no relevance to opening schools in the US?
Yeah, we had great experiences with the nurses, but being at the hospital was awful in terms of resting. Being home has been great (especially now that our ac is fixed).
> why did you edit out your comment to remove your assertion that what happened to schools in Israel has no relevance to opening schools in the US?  That's not at all what I edited out. I edited out an assumption I made that sounded like I was saying cases rising in Israel have no direct correlation to their schools reopening, which is of course not what I meant at all. I also removed reference to an article that shed some detail on the outbreak at the Gymnasia Rehavam high school in Jerusalem, which you cited. I felt it was irrelevant after re-reading my comment.  The comment that was not edited out was my main point, and I simply felt that the earlier comments were irrelevant to that point. But since you're comparing Israel to the U.S., Israel also reopened schools fully, with around 30 kids in each classroom, while going through a heatwave which caused them to run their AC constantly recirculate the air in many of their schools. They also go to school between 38-40 hours a week, Sunday through Friday. Those factors alone would make any virus spread quickly in those facilities.  > ...a spokesperson for Corinth High School said one person tested positive for COVID-19. Corinth Superintendent Lee Childress believed, unfortunately, this is the new normal. > [Childress] believed it didn’t matter when school started because COVID-19 wasn’t disappearing anytime soon. > “This isn’t going to be the only one and we won’t be the only school district that will have to deal with it,” Childress said. > Parents had the option of sending their children back to school or doing virtual classes online.  The Corinth school district got a case, did the contact tracing, had those affected quarantine, go to remote learning, and moved on. Sounds like they were able to deal with it OK.   > With back-to-school fast approaching, it’s important to point out that this was an overnight camp. > “Relatively large cohorts sleeping in the same cabin and engaging in regular singing and cheering likely contributed to transmission,” officials said.  It's also pretty obvious how the virus spread in the camp.  What we are seeing with all these circumstances is that there are going to be spikes here and there, reopening anything is going to result in more cases overall, and mass gatherings in close quarters for extended periods of time will also cause a higher risk, but that's true of most viruses. I worry more about the death rate and demographics around that than the number of cases. If, for example, 75% of a school of 1,000 people tests positive but 100% recover with mild to moderate symptoms, then I consider that a win, with of course the proper precautions taken by those infected to prevent spreading it further.  I have never said that we should just reopen schools "during a pandemic" will-nilly, and if any of my comments during this conversation have implied as such I apologize. But I also understand that it's probably not going away, and the best way to move forward with any opening of schools is with caution and taking the local community circumstances into consideration. And yes, I believe the governor should have included plan A in his choices for school districts, and I suppose we'll just have to disagree on that point.
> Israel also reopened schools fully, with around 30 kids in each classroom, while going through a heatwave which caused them to run their AC constantly recirculate the air in many of their schools.  Which is in no way similar to what would happen if we went with Plan A, right?  Plan A being the plan you think schools should be free to choose and incidentally, the only one Cooper put off the table, when he let school districts make their own call as to how to reopen.  It is interesting seeing you jump through hoops to explain how real life examples are somehow not comparable to what is happening in the US.  And yes, your comments in this thread give the appearance that you are trying to minimize the risk, gloss over the data that shows this is problematic, and push to re-open.  Edited to Add:  What I think is interesting about this, 'kids are not vectors' narrative that many are using to push to re-open is that in most cases, schools, parks, and other public areas have been closed, many parents have kept their children home, and generally kids have been less exposed than adults. So, it isn't terribly surprising that they don't make up a huge number of cases. Yet, many would use this as evidence of kids being low risk and potentially put them in harms way.
> And yes, your comments in this thread give the appearance that you are trying to minimize the risk, gloss over the data that shows this is problematic, and push to re-open.  Actually I look at all data that I can, not just what is pushed out by the popular media outlets. And the data does in fact show that, so far, children don't get sick as bad and don't spread it as easily as adults. I never said they don't get it at all, and I never said that it won't spread in schools. Rising cases is not bad when the death rate is falling, but I also understand that yes, there will be people of all ages that succumb to this disease. When media outlets post stories about a child dying with COVID-19 and spin it like our schools will be incubators of death, I have a problem with that fear-mongering. Let's be cautious, let's be serious, but don't let the hype overcome the actual facts, _all_ the facts, which show that schools opening with precautions will work. Even Israel knows this and will be opening with caution on time Sept. 1.

WRAL INVESTIGATES SC shows cutting off alcohol sales early could help in fight against coronavirus

Heck, I’ve been drinking and double or triple pouring at home this whole time. I have a hard time thinking why I’d want to go to a bar again, ever, when the ABC makes it cheaper and easier!
Should be before 11pm but no one asked me.
I’ve been almost exclusively bartending day and evening shifts since being allowed to reopen. Mask compliance and social distancing has been pretty good. I worked last night until cutoff at 11. Things went downhill pretty quickly after 7pm or so. The amount of people walking up to the bar to order with masks on and then pulling them down to talk was insane. No social distancing, just business as usual. We’re screwed.
Glad someone else is on this road to hell. I'm trying to set up automatic draft with the ABC store.
Lol I’m with you. Awesome username!
You know, for me as a woman, it’s a relief. No one groping my breasts, no one hitting on me, no one saying, “You’re ugly, bitch!” when you turn them down...
Ty!
Home distilling is illegal in NC iirc.  I won't tell anyone tho
As a man, I am sincerely sorry that you or any other woman or person is subjected to this kind of nonsense. The fact is, that some folks are aholes when they drink, to everyone. I've never understood it.
Having a still is legal...as well as using it for distilling water and making essential oils, etc. Alcohol? Not so much, though I'm sure most wouldn't even contemplate using it for such :-)
I said distilling not brewing, which is [def illegal in NC](http://www.distillate.org/laws/North%20Carolina#:~:text=State%20Overview%20state%20laws,and%20not%20for%20personal%20use.) (thanks prohibition!).  Like, directly in response to the dude saying he was looking into home distilling.  e: lol /u/LallybrochSassenach when you make a stupid comment you should admit it instead of deleting it, especially when it was sassy as fuck

Corona virus testing and unemployment
Hello. I work for a retail chain like Dollar General...but not DG. I have 3 children. We are under staffed. The bank we use for deposits and all other money has had a confirmed case of Covid19. My boss ignores the procedures in place (not asking the mandatory "have you traveled? Do you have a fever?" Questionnaire corporate has sent and requires her to email the answers to them daily...she answers no for me and sends it before i even get there.All because shes afraid she wont get a day off if i cant come in. Im working 7 days a week. Im so tired and burned out. Im upset that im losing time with my kids and risking my health and life to make ends meet. Im scared to come home to my kids at night for fear i will give it to them. I have traveled out of state 2 times since this has all started. Once to visit my dad. 1000 miles away after a heart attack. when i pointed out that the questionaire said im not allowed to work if iv traveled my boss said "your fine im sure. They didnt have it did they?" To which i replied "i guess we will have to wait and see wont we?"My question is...if i go get tested will unemployment pay me for the days i miss waiting for my results? Iv contacted OSHA, iv told my boss' boss...she also didnt care. Im afraid if i push much more i will be fired. I dont know what to do and im genuinely depressed over the whole thing.
Do you have childcare? Maybe you can get unemployment if you don’t. You may need to post at r/legaladvice.   I do not think they will pay you if you’re not symptomatic, I think your company is supposed to pay you, but having. To quit because of childcare may be a legit reason to stop working. You can also tell your manager that you need to have a day off, like, a full 24 hour period.
My manager doesnt care. She figures if she doesnt get a day off (due to her being a bad manager) that i shouldnt either.  Shes upset thar out company gave a $2 per hr pay increase to hourly workers like me and not to salary management like her. So im getting paid more than her right now and shes pissed about it. I cant help she signed a contract with them agreeing to work min 55hrs a week for a set amount of money...knowing she couldnt do the job in the allotted 55hrs...so shes usually there 80 hrs a week and i have to hear her mouth the whole time
I have my kids father that keeps them for me when im not at work he works first shift and i usually work 12-9 but since he doesnt get off until 3 i couldnt go in until closer to 4 everyday.
Sorry you are going through this, sounds like you want to work. Find another retail store that needs you for the hours that you are available. Do not quit. Make them fire you. But you should absolutely contact the unemployment office or social services for further advice. I wish you luck. Stay strong and be safe, you can do it!
Maybe you can quit and collect unemployment. My husband was forced to, and he actually makes more now than he did working. He had to quit because we didn’t have anyone to watch out kids
Thank you
I had no idea i could quit. I thought my hours had to be reduced due to the store having to close or something.
Call the unemployment office and ask, I think you can just honestly say you do not have childcare, but you have to say you’re available to work
Im going to do that. Thank you.
I think there are weekly certifications that you have to fill out, maybe you can make a post to r/unemployment and they can help you more. I don’t want you to get in a worse position than you’re in
Thank you. I ended up doing the online chat. They were very helpful.
I am so glad!! I hope you got a helpful answer. If you want to PM me any questions, I don’t know everything, but I know enough to be dangerous
I like that lol i sure will. Thanks again
