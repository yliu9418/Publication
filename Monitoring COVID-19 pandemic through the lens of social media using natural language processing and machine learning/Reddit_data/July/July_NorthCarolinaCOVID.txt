WTF: Florida: 190,000 COVID-19 Cases
Florida has an uncontrolled local epidemic. Personnel responsibility is out-the-window.https://fdoh.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/8d0de33f260d444c852a615dc7837c86The locals have "little will power" to change. The government lack "regulatory control" and enforcement needs to include a penalty (restriction).
Sounds familiar.   —NC resident

Coping with COVID-19 study: we want to hear the NC experience

Its had a negative impact on my relationship with my girlfriend of 4 years she broke up with me for a week and moved back in with her parents and claims I no longer make her happy and she feels trapped with me.
Affiliation: Rowan University Health and Behavioral Integrated Treatments (HABIT) Unit  Study Title: Coping with Mental Health Concerns Related to COVID-19  Study Description: We have recently launched a study investigating the mental health consequences during COVID-19 and how individuals have been coping thus far. You will be asked to answer several questions about your experience related to COVID-19, mental health symptoms, and substance use. In addition, you will be asked about the ways in which you have been coping that may help inform treatments for others who are struggling with the psychological impact of the global pandemic. You will be asked to make several hypothetical decisions on survey tasks and we ask you to be as honest as possible in your responses. Anyone who is at least 18 years old, English speaking, and a resident of the United States is welcome to take part. This comprehensive survey is anticipated to take between 20 and 40 minutes to complete. One out of every 25 participants will be selected to win a $100 Visa card. Participants will also have the option to be considered to participate in follow-up research that will result in further compensation.  Study link: [https://rowan.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\_bqgpBPGqUuRz8KF](https://rowan.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_bqgpBPGqUuRz8KF)  Disclaimer: This study is approved by the Rowan University Institutional Review Board , Pro2020001076. Participation is voluntary and can be stopped at any moment. Participation is VOLUNTARY and responses are ANONYMOUS. At the conclusion of the study, you will be redirected to an external website to enter your email address if you are interested in follow-up opportunities. No personal information can be connected to survey responses and all data is stored according to the data storage protocols of Rowan University. Any questions regarding participation in the study can be directed to the principal investigator Dr. Bethany Raiff at [habit4@rowan.edu](mailto:habit4@rowan.edu).

We are so sorry to hear how the pandemic has impacted your relationship. Part of why we are doing this study is to get a better understanding of the psychological consequences of the virus and on the response to it.

NC college (Elon University) requires COVID-19 tests for $129. Students could get stuck with the bill

I hope NC offers options. Our state fails because you have to "show symptoms" or "say you've been exposed" to pre-qualify for free testing in most cases.   The turnaround time for test results is 9-14 days so the idea is to try and target testing to those that are most likely to be positive (not just anybody who takes a test, and is likely to be negative).  A College has great intentions but there's a problem with implementing the plan. I think the cost goes on the students.  This is a "big guess" as to the rationale I see coming down the road for the coming school season. If I'm on a student budget: LIE! Do everything to qualify and get the free test.

Lowe’s Hardware won’t enforce its new COVID-19 customer mask mandate "citing worker safety" (according to News&Observer Newspaper).

great....more gaslighting hypocrisy and ethical slight of hand
Belmont Lomes is enforcing
I think this brings up one point: Are they just being honest with the public? It's a big PR blow to say we have a "relaxed" infection control policy when you're within our four walls.  I'm a hypocrit as this summer moves a long. My gym is as big as Lowes and I REALLY want it to open .... IF PEOPLE stop getting infected! I'm in a happy, little town so the gym is not packed with wall-to-wall hot, gay, sweaty men on treadmills..... so don't go there.  I'll wait for balanced policy. As Whitney Houston said: It's not right, but it's okay, I'm going to make it anyway
It’s been my experience that Lowes in particular doesn’t care at all about COVID or public safety. As much as I would like for tings to go back to normal, too, I know it can’t unless everyone starts doing their parts, and continue until we can be safe.

Please stop this school from putting kids in danger. They are not planning to follow the governor's rules regarding COVID-19.

This is a private boarding school?  Why not sign up for a public school-from-home option like k12 Academy?  Or homeschool for a year? Those options are free.

Hey, I’d recommend using a different crowdfunding option than Change.Org since they don’t use donations they receive to put towards the cause at hand. Instead they keep the money and likely use it for their own profit/upkeep. You can see this on their Wikipedia page as well as in several other articles, particularly in regards to the funds for the George Floyd petition (Change.Org’s largest campaign ever), which many people donating mistakenly thought would benefit the victims of his death.
Exactly. No one is being forced to send their kids there.
Right. Many are doing so. Unfortunately there are some that have been there in the community for a while and refuse to leave. They are also holding a graduation this weekend which is only putting more people in danger. They have not attempted to educate the non-educated about COVID-19 and seem to only be focused on getting students.   This is more about protecting the students who are forced by their parents to go there (and yes, that is something that a few students experience) as well as preventing any events from taking place that would put more people in danger.   EDIT: I thought I should also include the fact that many of the families involved with the school do not take COVID seriously, despite the fact their kids may think otherwise.
I think it might improve your petition to make it clear who it is you’re aiming to protect.  Like aiming to protect students forced into an unsafe situation by their parents, aiming to protect the community from a likely infection hotspot.  Those are perspectives that didn’t occur to me from reading your petition as it stands.

Covid-19 in USA - Top 15 States By Active Cases - 20 April to 28 July

A breakdown of current cases and hospitalizations by % of each state’s population would be insightful, e.g., per 100K people. Has anyone seen such a breakdown?

I follow /r/coviddatadaily and while I don't think I've seen that exact breakdown, you might be able to ask the creator of that sub for a chart that shows that data. The graphics over there are some of the best I've seen IMO
