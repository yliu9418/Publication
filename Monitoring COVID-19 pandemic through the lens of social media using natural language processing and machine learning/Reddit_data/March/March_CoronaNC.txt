Washington State: COVID-19 Testing (Clinics and Hospitals Overwhelmed)

The rule was recently changed to say that anyone can come to get tested. People are not happy that patients are "triaged" to the most serious or likely cases based on medical judgment.

WCPSS is cancelling all field trips in response to the COVID-19 cases in Wake County. This district is also lunching a page dedicated to updates about how the virus is affecting the school system.

The link doesn't currently say anything about cancelling field trips? All it says currently AFAICT is  > We are updating this information based on the State of Emergency declared by the Governor today. Please check back for additional information. 
Does it say how long the ban will go. My daughters field trip isn’t until May?
Models suggest virus to peak mid to early May.
I just read that it is unknown if refunds will be given. My daughters’ field trip in May cost $85 plus we paid another $85 because my husband volunteered to chaperone. Hopefully they will do refunds.
Good bot ❤️
OP is a teacher. She probably heard something.
Yeah WCPSS employees were emailed earlier, but they said that the website would be updated this afternoon.
I’m not sure. I think parents have been sent an email.
Jeez, I really hope they do!!!
Ah, good to know! Hopefully the page is updated soon. My son's trip to Richmond on Thursday is likely to be cancelled, just hoping to hear the confirmation!
Thank you! Good to know they're cancelling the field trips, it's certainly the right thing to do.
Models project virus to peak early to mid May. I would think remainder of year to be impacted.
Not doubting you, but can you share a source for this? It would be really helpful to have this resource handy. Thanks got sharing!

Elementary school teacher in Raleigh tests positive for COVID-19

Wait, so two separate schools had parents test positive? Thales and Trinity? The article doesn't say anything about a teacher testing positive. Does this bring the official count to 9?
I didn’t see anything in the article about a teacher testing positive. Do you have some kind of inside information on this or something?
I am only seeing reports of parents in that article, no teachers mentioned at all.    Did you have other information about it?

NC received new shipment of COVID 19 Test Kits. Problem: Extraction Agent is MISSING

"NC only has 250 test kits for the Coronavirus at the state lab. Additional kits are missing the extraction agent..."  I'm glad I've been working from home since last week despite my manager poking fun at people for being "too dramatic" ... 250 tests!?!?! That's it?!? There's over 10 million people in North Carolina. Until we can get our  testing under control and in the right quantity so supply meets the demand I am staying put
It's pretty obvious at this point that our government wants this to spread.  There have been missteps at every turn with the CDC.  If other labs across the country can have drive-thru testing, you'd think all states would have fast, easy testing.  But no, consistency in government is an oxymoron.

Ohh that's where the +15 came in Durham county came from all at once.
Thanks for sharing - it's not surprising that Duke University decided to shutdown campus operations before everyone came back.
F
What country did the 15 Duke people come back from?
I live in Durham and was rushed to Urgent Care on Saturday with shortness of breath and extreme chest pain. They listened to my lungs, didn't test me, and said I probably had a "non-specific viral upper respiratory infection" and told me to go home and take Ibuprofen. Then the doctor shook my hand. Today I woke up with a cough.  We're all fucked.
Parker and Otis, arguably the most popular coffee shop in the city was a ghost town this weekend...it's not even this empty during spring break. It's surreal.
I was wrong- per WRAL today not only did the say where the students went, they also identified which division of Duke they attend, and that they mostly live in the same apartment complex (unnamed). Duke was also quick to mention that these students were on vacation, not in a university program.   So much for confidentiality.
They aren’t going to say because it would make the people identifiable. This is, of course, against HIPAA.
Goddamn. I wish they had tested you for influenza. Btw the WHO is recommending that acetaminophen (tylenol) is better for COVID-19 than Ibuprofen.
What the hell?  Saturday?  And they didn't test for flu?  Or ask you to self-quarantine?  I'm sorry you're experiencing this.
What has me worried is I have bronchopulmonary dysplasia due to being born 4 months premature--50% of my lungs don't work and are complete scar tissue. If I get Coronavirus there's a very real chance I will die....
Nope... :-/
Oh no. I'm so sorry. Did you tell this to your doctor?
Wow, I'm very sorry. :(
He knows my medical history...

>A secret recording taken of Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr shows him warning a private audience three weeks ago about how the Coronavirus would have dire effects on the U.S.
Glad “private audiences” get the real story and not all of his constituents.
I knew all of this too from youtube including hydroxychloroquine data 2 months ago.
He even compared it to 1918. I dont remember any public figure (in America, at least) making that comparison. He basically gave business owners the warning that the rest of us needed. Three weeks is a long time to prepare.
Secret recording? Many of us in healthcare have been warning everyone of this since the end of January...
(not defending Burr as I've voted against him for years... but this is a lame reason to attack him)  His constituents were hearing from the CDC that SARS-CoV-2 was "low risk" every day... if he had come out publicly and said these things he would have been mocked as an "anti science" conspiracy theorist.  I was warning anyone who would listen since the end of January... but the media and CDC were saying "just the flu" and "low risk" so often people just blew me off.  Hell, **this morning** my Facebook feed has multiple people posting shit about the virus being a hoax.
Did you go around telling other people not to worry, that it was going to be alright?  Also, he’s in the Gang of Eight, so he has access to the absolute top level information that our intelligence services offered. He knew a lot more than you and I did.   He parroted that it was “just the flu” to his **constituents**, but told his **rich donors** to divest and prepare for an 18 month shut down, and sold $1 million worth of his personal stock before the market tanked, based on insider intelligence he received in briefings alongside the president.
Two faced. He’s two faced.
It wasn’t a secret, obviously. But it also wasn’t the message he was sharing with all of his constituents.   But the recording a secret, as Burr didn’t know he was being recorded.
Fair enough I have no power and warned family at first they did not listen and also HCPs. I warned highly educated HCP colleagues and a highly comped ranked person acknowledged but downplayed the issue. Then a close circle listened and prepared.  I left my million in the market because my husband did not agree. Not insider trading many warned publicly to get out. This was my mistake and I have learned my lesson. I did move my kid’s college money out of the market. A drop in the bucket compared to 23 years of saving and living below my means and saving 30% of my income. For this I blame myself. I have food, a dozen masks, paper supplies and prepared slowly over 2 months, I have not been to a store in weeks.  My sister asked me if I am secretly working for the government because I knew exactly what would happen. A colleague thanked me yesterday because she prepared her elderly parents. All of this prepping did not prepare me for my daughter telling me a friend she went to the Bahamas with is positive or the fear I have for my husband working in a pharmacy unprotected.
He's always for the GOP, until he leads an investigation into the GOP nominee. He's done so much, and 99% are worse than his policies, which are worse.

NC Covid-19 testing
What in the world is going on with our state's shift in focus with regard to Covid-19 testing????I was shocked to hear Mandy Cohen and Jennifer Mullendore suggest that we may not be testing as much as we moved into a "new phase," mitigation because community transmission had begun.  We have already begun the work of physical distancing which is part of mitigation but that does NOT mean we should stop testing!!!!  We should continue to test aggressively!After just getting some drive thru testing sites started in our part of the state this week (Western North Carolina), I was shocked to read that they ran out of testing supplies, closed down, and suggested that they may not even open them again.  What????ASHEVILLE - Buncombe's [drive-thru COVID-19 testing sites](https://www.citizen-times.com/story/news/local/2020/03/17/coronavirus-nc-buncombe-opens-covid-19-drive-thru-testing-sites/5066530002/) did not open March 20, and county officials said it's possible the sites are closed for good.  Interim health director Dr. Jennifer Mullendore said in a briefing that afternoon that the role of testing would change as the area begins to see community-spread of COVID-19. [https://www.citizen-times.com/story/news/local/2020/03/20/buncombe-test-sites-closed-march-20/2884594001/](https://www.citizen-times.com/story/news/local/2020/03/20/buncombe-test-sites-closed-march-20/2884594001/) Surely they are aware that testing is A CRITICAL COMPONENT OF CONTROLLING THIS VIRUS?  Social distancing is a temporary measure we are using out of desperation because of community spread, but it doesn't mean that we should stop testing aggressively!The World Health Organization continually emphasizes: test, test, test!  Mike Ryan today at the WHO press conference:"Large scale physical distancing, movement restriction, are in a sense a temporary measure. What they do, is they slow down, to some extent, the spread of infection in communities and thereby take pressure off the healthcare system. **They don’t fundamentally deal with the problem of disease transmission.** And if you want to get back to what countries like Korea are doing, Japan, or China, Singapore, and Hong Kong, and others.  **If you want to get back to that, you really have to get back to the hard core public health measures of case finding, contact tracing, quarantine, isolation.** So in some senses we need to slow down the virus, then we need to suppress the virus, and then we need to go after the virus. And that takes different combinations of different measures. But physical distancing measures and movement restriction measures are very hard socially and they are very hard economically. **And we need to use whatever time those measures are in place to put in place the public health architecture that can then go after the virus.**  Because lifting those measures may result in the disease returning if you don’t have in place the public health measures to deal with the virus."

We aren’t going to test. That time is gone. We are going to get a giant mission accomplished banner and a giant unexplained increase in Pneumonia deaths.
I live outside of Asheville- according to BPR, our local NPR affiliate, they closed drive thru test sites because they weren’t getting much volume or positive tests and wanted to conserve PPE equipment and other materials. You can still get tests locally.
Our leaders are idiots. This morning I tried to calculate when we'd see a slowdown in this. Mathematically what you'd look for is the inflection point when the exponential curve starts to change to a logistic curve. I realized that without testing, you can't accurately figure out the slope of the line because you need to know the change in new infections from one day to the next. In other words, we'll have no idea if anything we're doing is working, or when it starts to make a real difference, without enough testing. All "new" infections will just be "newly discovered infections" which isn't the same thing.  I've been tweeting and emailing our senators almost daily but maybe we should be emailing and tweeting the people you mentioned in this post.
It struck me that she said they would move to surveillance strategy using the influenza surveillance already in place in the state. When you look on the ncdhhs website you can see a map and providers that it looks are in this surveillance. In that case, does this mean that those providers will continue to do as much testing as possible? I’m no mathematician or epidemiologist but in my mind I’m imagining they use some kind of statistical modeling to assume how many cases are actually out there based on what’s coming in from these providers...  Someone who understands it better explain it to me?    https://epi.dph.ncdhhs.gov/cd/flu/figures.html   https://flu.ncdhhs.gov/data.htm
There are two different strategies being attempted around the world. One is extreme testing and contact tracing. You end up with low infection rates...but then what? The strategy that is being adopted by places where you aren’t seeing literal can’t-leave lockdowns is flattening the curve and gradually trying to build exposure and hopefully immunity.
On this issue---interesting article in the Washington Post today regarding a shift in testing: [https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/03/21/coronavirus-testing-strategyshift/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/03/21/coronavirus-testing-strategyshift/)  &#x200B;  I understand if we need equipment and tests to be prioritized, but I feel like we are just giving up if we reduce testing--allowing that the disease will run unchecked through the population albeit at a slightly slower rate.  Maybe that's all we have left at this point?  It also suggests to me that the social distancing will be very long term because if we stop it, we have zero checks.
This is so creepy and such a huge possibility.  This administration is beyond horrible.
Yes. More money is needed for the banner. I suggest a 1¢ tax increase. #BannerFund #SilenceThePneumoniaDeaths
Thank you for that information.  It makes me feel a modicum better, although I am still concerned at the statements from the podium (Mandy Cohen) that we are switching gears and will not be pushing testing.  We are all just sitting ducks if they are not out there doing the basics of public health: case finding, contract tracing, quarantine, isolation.
Jennifer Mullendore doesn't have a Twitter account but maybe you can reach out to her on LinkedIn https://www.linkedin.com/in/jennifer-mullendore-02600775
100%
Yes, I agree about the data then being meaningless.  Yes, I think we should be twittering them---anything to penetrate their haze.  I don't understand why there is such a disconnect between the World Health Organization's guidance and the success stories of countries that have been able to control the virus and what we are doing as a country.  It's as if they are all temporarily insane or something.
That's a good point and thanks for the links. I'm no epidemiologist either, but I'm doing the best I can to follow directives, protect my family, and educate myself about what should be done.  I would love to go back to my normal life and leave it to the "specialists." Ha!  I imagine they are using flu surveillance structures already in place (if I'm remembering correctly, that was a piece of the US gov't original "plan." I wish our state gov't would be more transparent about their methodology and logic.  You can't bring a population along without reasoning and information.  It doesn't help for them to switch gears and expect us all to "trust' the direction.
The red spike on the flu graph is interesting too---obviously they are picking up something...more flu perhaps or something else....
Nobody successful did one or the other. The successful countries did both.
Do you have a link? I haven’t read anywhere about building exposure and immunity to the virus.
This is not based in any reports.  The most successful flattening the curve method is through testing, testing, testing.
Yeah, I am not sure how I feel about their decision to not push widespread testing but just wanted to comment on what local radio was saying as of yesterday. As someone 35 weeks pregnant and freaking out I’m trying to get all the information I can! It doesn’t help that all the out-of-towners are coming to my small mountain town to ride it out because we have no known cases, but that’s a whole other topic. Ugh.
As a side note, it's sad how hard it is to get ahold of our representatives...I've looked at NCHHS site and there is very little opportunity to properly contact these folks.  I imagine at this point they are bombarded from all directions.
Great idea--thanks!
Agree completely.
Yea while I’m appreciating the daily updates I find that her answers sometimes lack depth. I believe a reporter actually asked her to expound on the statement about flu surveillance and she pretty much didn’t answer the question. I even heard him saying “I don’t understand....” and then the question got cut (I don’t think that was intentional tho).
Amen---again, the words of Mike Ryan:  "So in some senses we need to slow down the virus, then we need to suppress the virus, and then we need to go after the virus. **And that takes different combinations of different measures."**  Aggressive testing should continue!
We don’t have any successful countries to look to yet, it’s still way way too early. Some countries have been able to hold their infection rates down but global travel is a tiny fraction of what it was. We don’t know what will happen when things attempt to normalize.
Congratulations on your soon-to-be born baby!  I'm sorry that you have to go through this time with the added concern of pregnancy/birthing/baby.  Your baby will be such a joy to you when he/she is born. : )  Yes, it's hard not to have mixed feelings about our WNC cases being linked to New Yorkers traveling through the area.  We are such a global world these days!  Best wishes with your pregnancy and birth!
Believe it or not Senator Burr's staffer called me the other day in response to a ResistBot email and tweet I sent out. But yeah, they aren't easy to get ahold of.
I mean, that's fair. But we did learn what's been effective for South korea, china, and Taiwan. What they've said is social distancing and aggressive testing and contact tracing is what worked (so far).
No one is out of the woods, but we should at least be able to learn from those who are not currently in crisis as we are.
That's encouraging to know--thanks.  It will keep me at  it. ; )

Coronavirus tests are now available in North Carolina, health officials say

Tests are currently only available to CDC guidelines of Persons Under Investigation (PUI). Per the article: "People who meet criteria from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as a “person under investigation” for the virus will be able to be tested in North Carolina, the release says." As of 3/3/20 the CDC considers the following criteria for PUI:  history of travel to areas of sustained and widespread transmission, or in patients with severe respiratory illness even in the absence of travel history to affected areas.  [https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/hcp/clinical-criteria.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/hcp/clinical-criteria.html)    For the average person who gets a cold or bad flu-type illness in NC and wants to be tested, the current CDC guidelines don't cover you. This will be an issue if we see more local outbreaks, but we may not get enough testing until we have a Washington State situation where somebody passes away or has serious hospitalization and their contacts get traced and guidelines expanded.    It's still too little testing too late.

WATCH LIVE: First North Carolina novel coronavirus case confirmed in Wake County

Here we go. Sigh.
Do we know which town and or is Raleigh?
I’d love to know. Someone on Reddit must know the person.
CNN amended the article to read Wake County rather than Wake Forest. So either a simple typo or we weren't supposed to know that. The dot on the arcgis tracker shows off New Hope Rd in Raleigh. Not sure how accurate that is. FYI
According to CNN it's a wake forest resident
You are a true sleuth. Thank you
Ohhhhhhhh fuck.
That's near where wake med main campus is.
A man who is doing well per WRAL news. They are talking to his "close contacts". News also said he flew back----ruh, roh, those other passengers......
It is close to the campus but the dot is close to the Walmart on New Hope and 64. Not sure how JHU is populating these points.  https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/85320e2ea5424dfaaa75ae62e5c06e61
Passengers and the other airport his layover would have been. As far as I see there are very few direct flight from Seatac to RDU

First coronavirus case in North Carolina linked to Seattle-area nursing home


North Carolina Coronavirus Patient Arrived at RDU 10 days Before Testing Positive
 [https://www.newsobserver.com/news/local/article240862831.html](https://www.newsobserver.com/news/local/article240862831.html) " The Wake County resident who tested positive for the coronavirus arrived on a flight at Raleigh-Durham International Airport on Feb. 22, according to the airport, but was not found to have the virus until this week after becoming ill. "Better news for the plane passengers - less good news for Raleigh-area folks who may have been exposed. Looks like a fairly long incubation period (over a week).
Patient called his doctor and health department sent someone to his house to test. They discussed this at a press conference yesterday.
The article doesn't claim that. In fact it notes, "It’s not clear how the Wake County traveler came to be tested for coronavirus." Probably he wasn't tested at all for 10 days until symptomatic. NC health officials are still claiming (their position, not mine) that transfer is most likely only when symptomatic. So, yes, probably a lot of people were potentially in contact during those 10 days. Assuming he was infected in Washington State and not in NC.
Patient went to a doctor or hospital and was tested.
Thanks for the updated info!

Several tech companies are offering free video conferencing to help combat the spread of Coronavirus...
See article [here](https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2020/03/03/remote-work-cisco-webex-google-hangouts-zoom.html) \- I believe the cloud based voice services provider 8x8 is also offering free video conferencing as well.

Chatham County man confirmed to have coronavirus after visiting Italy

What in the absolute hell. This, it is these types of acts that will get people sick; other peoples' inability to take the general public into consideration when they make decisions to do something, despite the facts that prove that they should probably do something beneficial to themselves and others, like stay home.   Yes, the virus may not affect this person negatively; but without understanding how direct and indirect contact works this persons critical thinking skills as they pertain to critical thinking is flawed; that flaw puts everyone else in danger.   Just because they have the ability to pay for treatment or lolligag through their lives during a time like this absolutely does not mean, nor should it imply, in any sense of the statement or case of the word therein, that other people have that same luxury. It is not fair for them to decide that other people should suffer because of their inability to put people before themselves as they cough out a cloud of contagions in a public area and make everyone else around them sick. This is completely and deliberately negligent and absolutely inexcusable.   The more this happens, the more it will effect everyone, regardless of the measures they are taking. Unfortunately, it is beginning to appear that everyone has to take the negligence of the general public into consideration despite the fact that people who contract the disease and show symptoms are being told to take self-isolating measures, because of the fact that they choose not to adhere to the guidance being given. These are the kinds of people I do not want to be around, ever, especially when it comes to situations like this; however, I don't have much choice in the matter because those people will always be around, no matter where I go. "It's just a flesh wound/flu!" someone get this person a  bandaid please, they're going on the trapeze in 20 minutes, can't have no imperfections, the performance must go on, they said they're strong enough to pull through.   The people who deliberately choose to go out with symptoms of the virus should produce the data that they seem to have that nobody else does; I am failing to see any information on how we shouldn't take the illness seriously. Until then, I hope that they stop speaking for everyone else with their selfish decisions and actions, if no one else agrees, then, for myself in particular.  This "tough guy" and heroic nonsense of "I can tough it out, I'm tough," negates the people they come in contact with. Those decisions should not affect me, Jim, John Joey, or any other person, period, but they do. That crap doesn't work in this situation, keep it to yourself and tough it out at home.

Have you read about covid19? No obviously not. This dude was in Italy before it was known to be an outbreak zone. Also covid is asymptomatic for 14-27 days meaning he couldn't have known her got it.

1,895 Coronavirus Tests in the TOTAL USA!
OMG! That's all Government has done in Calendar Year 2020! That is a problem folks.
That is scary.
Where are these numbers from?
...  let's [just put this into perspective](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/covid-19-testing/).   1.4 tests *per million* (as of march 2nd)
r/NorthCarolinaCOVID
We are surrounded by it and don't even know yet.
An article The Atlantic put out yesterday. I will try to find the link.
what does this mean? i’m confused
Why are we splitting the NC covid community lmfao
Well I think we all know it, I continue to practice hand washing and basic sanitation as if it’s on every door handle.
Oh yea I saw that article(I’m reading so much stuff lately!).   The press conference yesterday about the 2nd NC case the gov said we have enough testing supplies for only 150 people. And they contacted the company directly that the CDC uses and are going to be getting enough supplies for 500.   They also mentioned being in touch with Duke, UNC and lab Corp and that soon those places will be able to test but “it will take some time”.   Ugh the CDC fucked this up
We have a community for the daily, public stuff. There is another community that takes a step back to talk policy, big picture stuff.
I guess. Seems unnecessary in my opinion, we have like 20 total posts on this sub as it is
This community will get a ton of posts. Go to the other one if you want fewer posts.   I appreciate the feedback.

North Carolina Coronavirus Helpline number announced

Last I heard NC only had 150 test kits so I'm assuming this hotline just tells people to wash their hands and not to to bother wearing a mask.  .. and if you get close to dying call 911 and then you'll be tested and we can start figuring out how many people you infected.
Meanwhile MUSC has free telemedicine for residents of SC. South Carolina just had a press conference. Do better NC.
Also note Mike Pence mentioned Covid-19 test kits at pharmacies, that would require training and non-existent PPE for pharmacists.
Pharmacies are definitely not equipped to perform PCR. At least none that I've seen.

"High Point Market full steam ahead amidst rapidly spreading coronavirus"


"High Point Market and Pre-Market 'full steam ahead' amid threat of spreading coronavirus"

Yeah. I live in the historic district literally two miles from there. Also, my husband works for a furniture factory.   No joke, though, his company isn’t playing about COVID-19. All the employees have to have temperature scans before they can go in. The company has several plants in China, and they have already dealt with it there, so they are using the same methods here.
Im about 9 miles from here. This just screams disaster!
There is a petition going around to try to get them to cancel the market: [https://www.change.org/p/governor-roy-cooper-cancel-spring-furniture-market-in-midst-of-coronavirus?source\_location=topic\_page&use\_react=false](https://www.change.org/p/governor-roy-cooper-cancel-spring-furniture-market-in-midst-of-coronavirus?source_location=topic_page&use_react=false)  I live in High Point and am due to have a baby on April 8th. I would really like to not have to worry as much about COVID-19...
The industry just canceled ISPA (International Spring Products Association) which is an every other year conference that was supposed to happen next week in New Orleans. I won’t be surprised if they cancel or delay High Point.  I posted before I read. Doug Basset does not speak for the entire industry. He speaks for his company. It would be a more valuable article if they actually spoke to someone from International Market Center.
Same. And... you know visitors stay all over the Triad - Greensboro, Winston-Salem, Kernersville...  :(
Good point. I did read this that has quotes from the [High Point Market Authority](https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/high-point-market-to-go-on-as-scheduled-despite-coronavirus-outbreak)
I’ve never been closer to strangers than in an elevator at High Point Market. Let’s see how this plays out.

Man with presumed coronavirus flew through Charlotte airport.

Him and 25,000+ people who flew from China and Italy since early January...
The Issue: No screening is occurring from Italy to USA.
No screening *can* occur, the testing supplies are incredibly scarce still.  Even if they had 2,000 suspected people come in to CLT they’d have testing supplies for maybe 50-200 of them at best.  Is it realistic to just mass quarantine thousands of people? Where can you even hold them? And how to enforce it?  It sucks but it is indeed the reality that no one is prepared to handle something like this.
They are taking their body temperatures. Watch the Italians going to soccer matches.   Everyone gets their temperature read prior to entering the building. Every player on each team and the stadium staff get their temperature checked.  The Italians are suppose to take everyone’s temperature prior to boarding the plane. You are quarantined in Italy.  The Israeli government has asked everyone regardless of origin of flight to self quarantine for 14 days upon arrival to their country.  A general question is: why are we not saying the same thing in the USA?
It’s already been established that body temperature readings like that are not reliable and there are many cases where people did not have a fever while infected.  Go ahead and ask Americans to self-quarantine for 14 days after a flight, do you think people are going to actually do that?  That businessman flying back and forth with an entire week planned ahead? He’s going to just upend work when he feels just fine?  People coming back from vacation and already uses their PTO time, are their employers going to be sympathetic to another 14 days of paid time off? If not paid during quarantine, then how about their bills?  That’s why this isn’t as simple as people want to make it seem.

NC Coronavirus Update - Latest on # of infected and outlook for more testing

Everyone is reassuring us that there is no community transmission in NC but they absolutely have not looked for it. Employees of Biogen may have been infected in Massachusetts. There is daily travel all over the country to hotspots and none of that meets the NCDHHS current testing guidelines. The current guidelines would have missed one of the 2 positive cases so far.   David Price did a FaceBook live this morning assuring us that there was no community spread. They cannot say this because the HAVE. NOT. LOOKED.  It undermines our faith in our leaders when they give such meaningless reassurances. It is reckless and we are losing time.  The guy from Duke said we are early in this epidemic. He is wrong. Things are moving very fast and we are wasting time we do not have to contain the crisis.
Thanks for the post. I created a "Discussion" post.  https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronaNC/comments/fg2kxm/senator_jeff_jackson_community_outreach_re_north/  I hope you would participate. Thanks for your consideration.
>	The guy from Duke said we are early in this epidemic. He is wrong. Things are moving very fast and we are wasting time we do not have to contain the crisis.  He’s not wrong but I believe you may have mistaken his meaning by that. This isn’t going away after one season — hence the word “early”.  Things have just started to begin. Look at US stock and bond markets, look at oil prices. Look at how companies are shifting towards contingency plans for employees.  It is undoubtedly moving fast, exponentially some might say, but it is still indeed early.
You are right that we have a very long road ahead of us.  He said it had only been too months without giving any context of the exponential growth we have seen in other places in just a few weeks.  I heard someone say that we should be making decisions today that would make sense 3 weeks from now because our information is at least 3 weeks old.

Indiana coronavirus patient was in Durham, Wake counties while symptomatic, officials say

😐😐😐
We are at the point where patient privacy is more important than community spread.
U gotta be kidding me
Why are people so f\*cking selfish? What's wrong with people?!
Apologies for my overreaction, it's hard to keep calm with all these cases popping up every day here in the US. :(
They may not have known at the time and thought it was a cold or whatever. More likely than intentionally running around spreading the virus, but who knows.
Alot of people are saying that the risk is low. That you shouldn't panic. I can see how someone with a cough might not want to come off as overreacting or might think that th chance of them having it is unlikely. Highly doubtful they knew they were at risk.
