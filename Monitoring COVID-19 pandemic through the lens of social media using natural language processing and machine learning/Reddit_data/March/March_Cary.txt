COVID-19: Town of Cary closes Senior Center; cancels senior programs and classes, town advisory boards and commissions through 3/22


COVID-19: Effective today (3/13) all Cary town gatherings with expected attendance of 100 or more are canceled/postponed

Late to the party. I live near high house and Davis. Doherty's Pub is still throwing down for their St. Patty's day shindig. I'm not advocating y'all go, just had a nice little chuckle on my way home.
Was at Target last night. Target had more than 100 people all touching items. Should we cancel Target?
drove past the festivity today. I was shocked. Meanwhile I'm getting mean looks as a "more than likely carrier" because I'm Asian. (People like me are getting punched for not wearing masks.) Like. What is this nonsense !!!
You stood there and counted 100 people touching items? My man, law school seems like it's a little too easy.
Funny 100 but Target isn't a TOC gathering
"Cary Fest 2020" is now "Cary Fest 2020 A" and "Cary Fest 2020 B"
Wait until one of their workers tests positive and the health department shuts them down for a week to ensure that all of the latent virus inside is dead.
IMHO, no, we shouldnâ€™t cancel Target now, because many of them have groceries and pharmacies.

COVID-19: All Town of Cary Parks, Recreation and Cultural Resources facilities are closed and programming, including classes, events and camps, and facility rentals are canceled until further notice

Does this include green ways?
This is a total disaster. Thank God Raleigh has decided to keep their community centers open.
according to the town of cary twitter greenways are still open! :)
piggy-backing this comment...what about PlayGrounds? (not on Twitter, so can't see the comments)
