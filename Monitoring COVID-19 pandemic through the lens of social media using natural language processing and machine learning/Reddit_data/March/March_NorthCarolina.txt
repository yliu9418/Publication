NC needs COVID-19 Drive-Thru Testing like South Korea (now adopted by Washington State)


Charlotte-area colleges planning now to possibly hold classes online due to COVID-19


Could schools be canceled statewide soon due to COVID-19?
What are your thoughts?
Seeing how the university systems are moving to all remote classes, I would say that there is a very high probability. Not if, but when.
Children generally are amplifiers of illness, I think it is wise.
Happening all across the country.
It should be a last resort, but it might be unavoidable. What we really need to do first is vastly increase our testing efforts so we can better identify clusters. Then I think we should be shutting down schools on a case by case bases.   Remember- we have over 1.5 million students in our public education system. Closing all schools means hundreds of thousands of people who will have to stay home with their kids and cannot work remotely will lose wages. Thousands may even lose their jobs. We may be able to prevent most of the latter for happening with expanded family leave, but we can't force businesses to pay for well people who aren't working.
Good idea. Push kids into Daycares (which is no safer) or force parents to stay home. Medical workers have kids too. But now they are staying home to take care of their children.
Chapel Hill-Carrboro has just closed their small district from 3/18-4/3 (unless they need to extend) and Durham Public Schools BOD meets tonight. I would bet they’ll release a similar adjusted calendar and closing schedule. It’s definitely happening near NC hotspots.
Ohio k-12 schools just got closed for 3 weeks, and they have fewer cases than we do.  I don't think we'll be far behind.
I would just like my kids' school system to communicate with us and let us know they are alive.  They haven't provided any updates, plans, are continuing to run events even though the NCDHHS has explicitly advised against it - at this point, I am not sure I trust this school system to make the right choice for my kids.   I'm pretty opposed to home schooling, but may do it for a few weeks if I cannot be confident that the schools are going make reasonable decisions.
There is a big difference between public primary education and university education.   The first (and largest factor) is that 99% of college students are adults. A university is not responsible for their students' care in the same manner that public schools have to care for children. College students can be left alone. A 6 year old can't. Universities aren't responsible for making sure their students eat. Public schools are. You get the picture.  This, in turn, means parents will have to stay home with their kids if schools are closed. Like I said below, this will absolutely lead to lost wages, and could potentially lead to lost jobs. We want to prevent as much of that as possible.   The second difference is that primary schools are not set up for remote education like universities are. Almost *every* university in our state has existing infrastructure in place for online courses and remote education. That is not the case for the *vast* majority of our public schools. Even the ones that are will be unable to reach all of their students due to things like lack of access to internet. Two weeks, a month, or even more of no school will mean that these kids are not receiving their education, and will absolutely mean summer school and other make-up schooling (weekends, etc) to meet requirements. Not sure if a lot of you highschool-aged people really want that.  I'm not saying that we won't close public schools, or that we shouldn't if that time comes. I'm just saying there is a very big difference in impact between closing in-person college courses and closing public schools.
Well, that would not be closing schools then.
> ~~Children~~ Outbreak monkeys generally are amplifiers of illness, I think it is wise.  FTFY
Mostly at a district level, case by case bases. Not familiar of any state officially closing schools.

COVID-19
I go to a high school in wake county and a fellow student’s dad has the virus and yet we are still expected to show up?Edit: I should mention the parent was at biogen
did the student show up at school?
How crazy is our public school system that they don’t allow hats because that’s too big of a distraction to learning, but letting a kid whose dad has a super contagious pandemic-level virus come to school for even a little bit isn’t cause for keeping anyone else away.
Amazing.   Do they know about the case?
Im worried because I can get it and give it to my immunocompromised dad.
If you do not feel safe, go home; but make sure your parents agree so they can challenge the school.
That would scare me. I definitely understand your concern!
Kids can apparently carry it asymptomatically for a long time.
What school?
I'm a CMS student and there's no way that's not already in a district as big as ours. Heck, I go to one of the smallest high schools and with the amount of sickness and respiratory illness I wouldn't be surprised if someone here has it.
Yes for around 20 minutes
Many students are getting picked up now
I’d expect so. His dad is quarantined at home right now...
Unbelievable 🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️
That’s fucked up!
Good to hear. Stay safe man. There’s no reason to stay if you feel uncomfortable or like your safety is at risk. That’s not an environment for learning anyway. Keep in contact with your parents and keep them updated. Back when I was in high school I would have just left, but I’m probably not the best role model on that front lol.
> I’d expect so  When it comes to information, I run under an "assume nothing" rule. Make sure you've told them that the dad was confirmed to have COVID-19 and the student still showed up at school.

COVID-19 Case in Cabarrus County Confirmed

It would be helpful if these reports told us how long the person had been back spreading the virus. You know so we can know how fucked we are.
Yeah, no doubt. Or at least tell us where they could've been around town. "Hey this guy went to Target yesterday so don't fucking go to Target".

The latest on COVID-19 in North Carolina
\*The state, like many others, is waiting for a chemical reagent that is used in the lab to test for the virus. Cohen said they have plenty of testing kits that are used to take the actual samples from patients.Health officials have also been waiting for the FDA to approve an alternative testing method – once that happens, the state will be able to test 1,500 people in the next week.\*[http://www.ncpolicywatch.com/2020/03/12/special-update-the-latest-on-covid-19-in-north-carolina/](http://www.ncpolicywatch.com/2020/03/12/special-update-the-latest-on-covid-19-in-north-carolina/)
Would not be suprised if there is over 1500 infected in wake county alone.
Yeah, this has been a massive cluster fuck by the Trump Administration. He's concerned about numbers so he's not going out of his way to remove bottlenecks from the test pipeline. Apparently, if he doesn't do anything, then no one can point to something specific he did as a problem.

NC task force on preventing the spread of Covid-19


Wayne County resident tests positive for COVID-19, is quarantined at home


Who looks out for North Carolina's state temporary workers (F/T and P/T) during this covid 19 crisis?
Who's looking out for the temporary, full-time and part-time, state workers? People who are trying to tow the line in order to get a better job, especially seeing as some others in the current positions may not deserve them (personal opinion). We aren't offered decent benefits (we're already at a disadvantage in pay because the state is taking their cut with their fake temp agency) because the amount taken out of the check for health care practically nullifies the dollar amount per hour you are offered.  We're expected to be at work, to hear from our "second" line bosses and their demands, but also won't receive sick pay or vacation time.  Also, we're not given respect by the actual state workers around us that we work with.  Given the seriousness of Covid-19 in our communities, it's especially dangerous to the temp workers who are working closely with the general public.
Yup; and this state of things is what we get when we run a libertarian/conservative government and society, and keep voting in people who don't want things like worker protections or paid sick leave for fear of moral hazards.  It's a state of profits over human life right now, and history will view this as a dim time for many in power. Yet, people keep voting those folks into office and not wanting any social safety nets.   The best we can do is try to take care of each other, but so many people aren't used to doing that any only look out for themselves and their profits and latte.
I believe voters will learn some tough lessons about how business has always been done here in NC. The state has never protected workers. Now, when the most vulnerable are going to get hit the hardest, there are no safeguards in place to protect them.  Every time we visit the store, we see workers being exposed. They are there for one of two reasons: either forced due to the strong possibility that they will be fired, or they can't spare a week's worth of pay.  Restaurant workers have it worse. If the restaurant closes, no paycheck. If it stays open and only serves takeout, servers won't make enough in tips to even make minimum wage.  Contract workers are also in a bad situation, since they are without any safeguards at all.  I would like to see some ideas for how to help these workers? Could we start a fund to support workers impacted by a pandemic, much like we would do when there is a natural weather disaster? How quickly could we get something like that mobilized at a state level?  In the long-term, I'm going to be making sure candidates I vote for address these issues in their campaigns and back up their promises with action if they are elected.
Agree

Person ill with COVID-19 attended Raleigh Lego convention, putting some at ‘risk of exposure,’ officials say

I’ve heard recently that a lot of people were tested for the flu, the test came back negative and they were sent home. They were not actively testing for corona on people that had not been in contact directly with someone known to have it until recently. One of which case I know of was from as far back as mid-February and the dr now believes it may have been corona from a winter cruise... This virus has been lurking, we’re just deciding to freak out about it now. So maybe give this person the benefit of the doubt for once Raleigh?
Almost went to this with my kid, and we decided not to at the last minute specifically because of germs and all of the crap going on. Glad we did.
That person should be held responsible for any infections that arise because of their negligence.
This whole thing just keeps getting better and better!
I agree...Some people show mild symptoms but may carry it, like young people who thought they just had a cough from allergies.  This virus has a crazy long incubation period.  They probably had no idea they were sick.
Good luck trying to prove those infections originated from this person.
Yup .. you are sick and decide to go to these events and put everyone else at risk.. that is absolute negligence! Stay home if you are sick!!!!!!
Agreed
That's me... I've had a cough and an 'upper respiratory infection' for a week now. I work in RTP, I have shaken hands with customers who have travelled all over the world, including China. The doctor just shrugged the idea off and said to call if I get a fever....
Happens all the time, thus the term "Con Crude" comes from. I wish people that were sick don't attend conventions regardless if its the cold, flu, COVID-19 or some other ailment.
The problem is that people are infectious before they have any symptoms.  Some people who are infected never feel sick, and they're capable of spreading the virus.  The people who run the convention should have cancelled it, and no one should have attended it.  But that was a week ago.  This thing is moving fast.  It was possible to think that the risk was low, a week ago.
You can be asymptomatic for weeks and still be contagious with Covid-19.
Lucky for you COVID19 is a *lower* respiratory infection.  Still you should have been tested, anyone with cold like symptoms should be.

Woman who traveled outside NC is 1st Wilson County COVID-19 case

I see you've expanded from your crappy construction updates in order to farm other hot subject.

Getting in touch with Roy Cooper about COVID-19 measures?
I’m no expert, but it honestly seems like one of the best steps we can take as a state to increase social distancing is closing bars and restaurants. It doesn’t seem like the federal government is going to take this step any time soon. What is the most effective way to pressure officials into doing this? Either citywide, county-wide or state wide? I’m just one random chick in Mecklenburg county, so I know I don’t have any real influence here. Is there a way to get a bunch of people to sign onto something in an attempt to pressure officials?
As someone in the restaurant industry, it needs to be done today.  Tomorrow is St. Patricks Day, a day where people like to go out and drink.  I delivered to a bar last night and it was packed, and that's with many college students not in town due to the extended spring break.  I heard one of my co-workers say some of his buddies are coming into town specifically to party tomorrow.
On a related note, my company is dragging its feet in regards to remote work., despite having the tools and resources to do so.  I can't imagine we're the only one like this, so I'd like to see Gov. Cooper make remote work mandatory for all applicable employers.
My wife’s bakery is about to close (Western N.C.). The mayor is basically holding the gun as we speak about closing all nonessential businesses. We are so incredibly fortunate, because such a massive hit to our income would have crippled us, but we’ve managed to save over the last two years for things like a home down payment and an emergency fund...   Two years we’ve pinched pennies and saved, and it’s gonna drain over he next few months...
Flood his inbox: https://governor.nc.gov/contact/contact-governor-cooper
Well, since Cooper is a Democrat (which means he's at least moderately reasonable), it's likely he'll make that move later this week, if not in the next day or two, following NY, CT and NJ doing the same.  As far as petitions and such, your best bet isn't getting a whole bunch of regular people to advocate or sign, find someone with some clout to advocate and you'll have a better shot at getting what you want done, done.
i went to the doc on wed and she told me flat out you could only get a test if you were in the hospital eastern NC
https://governor.nc.gov/contact/contact-governor-cooper
There might be no need. Other states seem to doing similar measures, and it's starting to feel inevitable that will happen here. Minutes ago Rhode Island banned gatherings of more than 25 people with All dine-in food and beverage services shutting down. (Drive-through and takeout delivery service can remain open).
Those restaurant and bar workers got rent to pay... You gonna foot the bill?
Stop overreacting
My fiancee’s sister (who we live with) has a schedule where she goes into the office for a few hours and comes back and then works from home.   They refuse to close the office and mandate working from home despite every other building in her organization (according to her) being closed AND CLEARLY EVERYONE HAVING THE ABILITY TO.   I’d say I’m mad about it but both me and him work customer facing jobs that won’t be closed until meaningless retail organizations (non food, supplies, etc) are forced to, so we’re horrendously exposed either way.
Agreed. I can do 100% of my job remotely but my company is refusing to allow it.
I feel for you. Buncombe county?  Thinking about you and your family. These next few months are going to be hell.
Thank you for this.
This doesn't seem like a time for party differences, Ohio has acted extremely aggressively to slow the spread of the CoronaVirus and has a Republican governor
The fed government needs to do its part to prop people up financially right now. It boils down to the fact that no one’s income matters if they’re dead. 🤷🏼‍♀️
Thats the type of attitude that gets at-risk people killed. Educate yourself.
Not buncomb, but close: Transylvania.
I would allow that occasionally Republicans can act reasonably when their existence is threatened, i.e. Trump finally coming to terms with the fact that Coronavirus isn't a Chinese or Democrat hoax.  Governors as a whole are normally very pragmatic when dealing with situations like this, as well.
You realize that money is our money right? So we should tax ourselves to give money to ourselves?
You do realize it was our money that bailed out farmers who lost income due to Trump’s tariffs.
no it isn't. The federal deficit doesn't matter. Our taxes don't pay for federal programs. Our taxes maintain demand for dollars and prevent runaway inflation
Yes. That is how society works. Those who have help those who have not.
And I'm not ok with that either.
Excellent.

A Guilford County resident has tested positive for COVID-19, the county's first

Patient has recently traveled to Orlando, FL, and works at Syngenta (Swing Road off W. Market).
There’s no way there’s not more. As many people pass through Guilford for there to be cases in Forsyth and counties further East.
It's impossible to get a test in Guilford. I've been sick for about a week with "pneumonia" but because I haven't traveled they won't give me a test.
And further north. Rockingham County and even Danville, VA and Martinsville, Va, Henry County, etc are commuter communities.
There were at least 10,000 out of towners here for the first two days of the ACC tournament.
Can't be counted if you're not tested.  Trump rejected test kits from the WHO, test kits that everyone else is using, preferring to dump money into building American only test kits from the ground up.  One of those companies, Oscar Health, was founded by a Kushner.
Get well soon & stay TF away from me!
I'm in Durham and at the beginning of this month my wife and I both had a fever and dry cough that lasted about a week and a half, they wouldn't give us a test either.
They definitely need to supply more tests and expand requirements to get it. If you have symptoms or think you’ve been exposed you should be tested.
Exactly because money > people.
I'm staying away from everyone but my dogs!

UNC-Chapel Hill community member tests presumptively positive for COVID-19
Dear students, faculty and staff:We are writing to let you know that a member of our campus community has tested presumptively positive for COVID-19. This individual is an UNC-Chapel Hill employee and they are currently self-isolating at home in accordance with the guidelines established by state health department and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control.If you are identified as a close contact of this individual, you will be notified directly with guidance and next steps.For additional information about the COVID-19 and steps that UNC-Chapel Hill is taking to protect the health and safety of our community, please visit the University’s dedicated coronavirus website.
If they get the tests really up and running,  won't be long before there won't be individual reports, just daily tallies.
Well shit. That’s my school. Lol
Uh oh
Got pinged that someone at one of my meetings last week tested positive.  It's already everywhere, and all the tests can do at this point is hope to catch up eventually.

covid-19 rumor, credible?
Just heard a rumour from a school principal that the 2 pm press conference from Gov. Cooper will include an announcement closing "all non-essential businesses." Anyone else heard the part about "non-essential businesses?"
What’s the distinction between working from home and closing?  If all my staff are working from home and I run a nonessential business do I need to close?!?
Rumors are rumors, but this is the next step that several states have already taken, and we seem to be following that path after first closing schools and then banning dine-in restaurants.   After that, "Shelter in place" may be implemented with a curfew, and is already being discussed for Meck Co.   After that, not much left we can do unless we're in full-on martial law.
So what is considered essential
No, but I hope so. I work at a non-essential business...my life is worth more than ten bucks an hour that they pay me. Going unpaid will suck ass (and not in the good way!), but dying would suck ass more.
Maybe later you can spread some more untrue rumors.  &#x200B;  Fucking idiot.
Why would a school principal know what the governor is going to announce?
No, that's more or less closed, as in none of your staff are front-facing dealing with the public on day-to-day matters in your business. As much as they can be, they are staying home, making contacts by phone or electronically, but the public does not have a place to gather/visit/interact with your business for the time being. Basically, if you are not having an open brick-and-mortar location, you are in the clear.
Nothing has been announced.  Wait patiently and calmly.
Healthcare, utilities, banks, gas stations, grocery stores, and anything else everyone needs for day-to-day life.
Plus you could potentially collect unemployment for your missed shifts if the governor shuts down your workplace
   >spread some more untrue rumors  Dude, I was asking if anyone could substantiate it. I was trying to *verify* if this was an untrue rumor. That is different from saying it. I think your words are a bit harsh. Of course, it *was* just a rumor.     .
Even though schools are closed, faculty/staff are still working behind the scenes working logistics for remote learning or making up classes. Even with the schools closed school officials still get and need updates from government about other government closings and announcements.
Because the public school systems are run by the state. They are state employees. Is this a real question?
My suspicions are also growing because it's 2:30, guy said something about 2, and nothing has been announced.
Doctors, pharmacies, medical supply stores, possibly laundromats.
So dollar stores like dollar general?
I'm part time seasonal temp so no, but I also have high blood pressure and am at increased risk.
Thank you my dude.
The schools are already closed. There would be no reason for them to be notified.  Donald Trump isn't emailing federal employees before he has a press conference.
I guess it depends on whats in your area.
We are getting notified, still. Mandatory and Essential staff are still operating.  Still planning.  IT is busy as hell, for example.   The Police at Universities will stay.  Schools need physical facilities work.  The Administrative staff is crushed right now.  HR Departments are being more agile than ever.  Yeah, we need to stay informed.
Schools are still working. Office administrators like principals are still going to school. Teachers are working from home.
Why is this so upsetting to you?   I didn't state that this was truth. You're being a dick because I asked for *verification* about something *I heard.*  I also didn't say he was notified officially or by email. I don't know how he received this information, but state employees know other state employees. You do the math.   Also, I assure you there are school system employees who are working from home. Fuck you if you don't recogbize that they're doing a thankless job for unfair wages, constantly hindered by top-down, out-of-touch bullshit administration from the board of education, which is populated by morons. It's not like school closes and the work evaporates. The amount of work outside of school hours that administrators (and teachers!) have to do is substantial, and an empty building doesn't keep them from doing it. These circumstances are chance for them to catch up on backlogs and work on new projects that they may not have had enough time to devote to while school was in session.  Either fuck off or learn not to be a dick for no reason.
Thank you. It's good to hear this from the source.
Yes. Schools are in a massive planning stage, which is why they would not need to be notified or be distracted by notice that the governor might close real estate offices and insurance stores. I'm sure they're being informed of what's pertinent to them.
>Teachers are working from home.  haha... I wish.
I’m a teacher and I’ve been working from home since yesterday. My students have been doing their math and reading lessons/work thanks to my online videos.
Wow... yes, clearly I'm not a teacher, because it's so easy tell over the Internet.  I am a school librarian (which is treated exactly like a certified teacher), and Cherokee County, Clay County, and Jackson County are still making teachers come into work every day. I went to the school Monday, I went to the school Tuesday, and I went to the school today to work a full shift from 7:30 am to 3:30 pm, because at least in my county, we were told we would not get paid if we did not come in for these required workdays.  Maybe consider that everyone isn't having the same experience as you.  Edit: Perhaps you misinterpreted my low-level snarkiness at still being required to go in when the rest of the state is allowed to be working virtually right now. Haha... I wish I was able to work remotely.
My kids are soooo bored—-the school system keeps calling and emailing to tell them to check for resources they are providing online but they aren’t posting anything.   I haven’t looked into it yet but isn’t there an online k-12 option for N.C.?   Is that something that is still functioning and maybe they could join?   Hahaha also my kids are wondering how this plays out.  How long before they go back to school.  Are the rumors school won’t restart for the test of the school year.  If that happens will they advance or have to repeat the same grade another year.  Lol help me out here—any insider info?

Our Senator was telling private groups how bad COVID-19 would get while saying nothing to the public and while Trump was saying it would disappear


Burr Recording Sparks Questions About Private Comments On COVID-19

A secret recording taken of Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr shows him warning a private audience three weeks ago about how the Coronavirus would have dire effects on the U.S.   This recording happened the SAME DAY the president was saying "one day the vurus will just disappear." Burr was telling this will be " Akin to the 1918 pandemic..."  Burr was giving this update at a luncheon to the "Tarheel Circle" a members only group which membership  costs between $500-$10,000  Senator Burr, you could have given this information to the people at a time when it could have been very impactful and SAVED LIVES. But, no it was witheld from the average person because....?  Well senator Burr, from the bottom of my heart, fuck you very much.
It's like Burr and Tillis are actively competing for the title of Worst Senator
How many attendees quietly sold off holdings and made personal arrangements while keeping  employees and public markets in the dark?
Why are both of our US senators garbage?
Burr is a traitor to the American people and our constitution.
It gets better:[Senator Dumped Up to $1.6 Million of Stock After Reassuring Public About Coronavirus Preparedness](https://www.propublica.org/article/senator-dumped-up-to-1-6-million-of-stock-after-reassuring-public-about-coronavirus-preparedness)
Are there going to be any consequences for him?   I mean, here's a man who could've sounded the alarm. Someone who clearly believed COVID-19 to be a serious threat enough for him to tell the gathered elite donors. If he was running a think tank where corporations paid for membership to hear his thoughts and analysis, I wouldn't begrudge him. And yet, here is our Senator, paid by us, and he only whispered it to a chosen few.   At BEST, it's cowardice. It's the lack of courage to say the thing you know to be true out loud because the administration and their slavish supporters would've been outraged he didn't toe the line.   At worst, it's dereliction of duty and an absolute betrayal of his constituents.   But I ask again, will he face any consequences since he's not running for reelection?   How do we make sure that he does?
Anyone and everyone that voted for Burr, or any other republican, is responsible for the lack of health care, lack of pandemic response, massive job losses, drained retirement investments, the countless coming COVID-19 death toll, and the crash of the economy. Good fucking job you assholes.
Dick Burr - as irritating, painful, and dangerous as it sounds
Why did this come out now? Should've dropped this right after the prick said it.
If Burr made those comments publicly instead of to donors,  there would be a statue of him built on the state capitol grounds. Instead he chose to live down to expectations and toe the party line bullshit that Trump was spouting the very same day.   Piece of shit will have to live with that the rest of his life.
Re-posting to comply with Rule 3
Thanks for sharing this! Fuck Burr. Impeachment.
Nice to see how he's taking care of his people. Telling the rich the truth, while leaving the rest of us to get sick.
Maybe he just wanted fist dibs on toilet paper
This news should be posted on every States sub.
I thought this was Bill Burr at first... But also, fuck him for putting lives at risk.
If you fuck up enough, you can say you were unprepared for such a tragedy.

Doesn't matter what they do. They got a big fat capital "R" beside their names, they can do no wrong.
Because of the **G**reedy  **O**ld **P**arty
And yet... people in NC keep voting him in. :(
The entire Republican party are active traitors.
The fucking clowns will never realize i'ts all their fault either.
You can't pick and choose the issues like that, it's a package deal. Democrats are just as much to blame for not dropping the other issues as Republicans are for not overlooking them.
Haha, are you really blaming Republicans for a global pandemic and it's economic toll? Hate to break it to you, my dude, but no one could have prevented an economic downturn from this. Europe is going through the same thing. You blaming Republicans for the death toll in Italy, too?  Personally, I've voted for plenty of Republicans in NC, and I'm glad I did. Thanks to them, we are significantly more prepared for economic downturn than we were when they took up the mantle from 100+ years of Democratic rule:  - $1.2 billion rainy day fund - $2 billion in unspent cash reserves - $4 billion in Unemployment Trust Fund - Strong security in state pension plan - Moody's ranks NCRS best funded in the country - Pew Charitable Trusts analysis states pension fund is well-positioned to maintain solvency during tough economic times. - State pension checks are continuing to go out on time  Responsible budgeting has put us in a great position to help North Carolinians in need in the coming months of almost certain economic hardships. This is what all the sacrifice during the good times has been in preparation for.   Remember this when you're getting help in the months ahead and calling the hand that feeds you "assholes" at the same time. I'll be remembering this in November. "Good fucking job", indeed!
We do. His answers are hollow and trite. He’s a tool, and has no spine to answer us honestly.
It all depends upon when NPR got ahold of the recording.
>Piece of shit will have to live with that the rest of his life.  He'll be quite comfortable atop his pile of money.  You have to have a conscience to feel any guilt, and it appears from this and other incidents, that Dick doesn't have one of those installed.
I just don’t get the point. Keep markets up? They must have known they’d fall eventually. Why be so deceptive when there’s no benefit?
You now this MF probably sold all his stocks with this information.
First dibs on shorting stocks.
 Tills, Burr and Meadows could teach a classes on political corruption
Sorry kid, "publicly available" is a lot different than selling your stocks while you say nothing to the public and your president saying the problem is a Democratic hoax.
Yes, we should definitely strictly lockdown Richard Burr.
They knew before that. Burr is the chair of the Intelligence committee, which should have been receiving briefings by the start of the year, and on the Education, Health, Education, Labor Committee, which should also have been getting briefings with accurate information by that point, too. So they basically just watched people drag their feet on this and lie about it, and kept quiet.
Oh, he "took action". The action was dumping all his stocks and warning all this friends and donors that the market was going to tank.
I dont think you know what the term ground zero means....
1,300 tested cases. That's a huge clarifier.
> Wow. They knew in February. They didn't take action till after March 15th.  False. Here is an editorial from Burr himself on **February 7th**: **[Coronavirus prevention steps the U.S. government is taking to protect you](https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/coronavirus-prevention-steps-the-u-s-government-is-taking-to-protect-you-sen-alexander-and-sen-burr)**
Im sure this would be one of those , " ive investigated myself and found i did nothing wrong " moments
I would *love* to see the attendees' investment moves after that luncheon.  I bet you a lot of stocks were sold, maybe even short options, etc.
of course....you gotta be able to short your position!Then invest the rise!!  bunch of crooks!!! Pathetic. Some humans really suck!!
Actually if you were following international news you knew back in January that this was coming. But everyone was all concerned about impeachment. I stocked up on essentials back then
With as blue as North Carolina is becoming, hopefully that will be a thing of the past. Really, the Democrats should focus on flipping NC over the next few years.
You have to remember that the racist got gerrymander is to the point that it didn’t really matter who we voted for.
He is not up for re-election; going straight into being a corporate whore lobbyist.
Either they're too stupid to realize they keep voting against their interests or they are aware and are fine voting for this kind of person so long as the people getting hurt are the "right kind of people."
It isn't a Democratic president that putzed around saying that this wasn't a serious problem. Nor was it a Democratic House and Senate that kept trying to shove Hyde Amendment language into relief bills.      The response to C-19 has been a disaster and has been amplified by the continued coverage the GOP and its constituency has provided for the party officials and the president. If you don't like it, tough. Maybe have an ideology that values science, expertise, and education.
I don't think this is what people are implying. It's more along the lines of as a society we should have safeguards in place to minimize the loss of life and support people through difficult times. Our preparedness for this event is horrifically inadequate on so many fronts and people are going to die for it.  The general trends of politics show the Republican party constantly picking away at these protections. I'm not even going to get into the economy because the whole topic assumes we should value it over lives.  Edit: grovertheclover did say the economy as well. Which seems out of place among the rest of the reasons.
> Hate to break it to you, my dude, but no one could have prevented an economic downturn from this.   The epidemic crisis prevention team that Donnie got rid of probably could have seriously lessened the blow.  >Personally, I've voted for plenty of Republicans in NC, and I'm glad I did.  That's because you're a shameless loser that can't see beyond his own nose.  >Thanks to them, we are significantly more prepared for economic downturn  How's that NC movie industry doing these days?  >Responsible budgeting  We talking the same people who cut emergency crisis budgets a month before one of the biggest hurricanes to ever hit the state?  >I'll be remembering this in November.  My only regret is that I only got to vote to make McCrory cry like a bitch once in my life.
Your entire comment is based on an idiotic and pathetic strawman.   >Haha, are you really blaming Republicans for a global pandemic and it's economic toll?   No, he isn't. No one is. The entirety of the rest of your comment is irrelevant because it is based on a false premise.   They are not responsible for the global situation. They are responsible for the situation in the United States.   What we ARE saying is that Burr and the rest of the Republican Party have been in public downplaying this issue for over a month while in private they have made it clear they understand the real threat.   People are going to die because instead of restricting international travel, setting up screening for international travel, getting tests created, improving the testing process, and enacting preventative policies they did the exact opposite of that. They refused to accept tests from outside organizations, they are refusing to adopt the testing method used in South Korea, and they kept saying to go out and be social and don't stay home.
State pension plan doesn't do shit for the tens of thousands of workers and small business owners that lost everything this week. The republican-controlled government knew this was coming for months and actively worked against preparing for this pandemic. Instead of putting the necessary effort into preparing, they were publicly calling the disease a democratic hoax. What the fuck?? You and everyone else that votes for these enemies of our nation are responsible for this tragedy.   My spouse is a healthcare provider at Duke hospital, which happens to be the largest hospital in the state. They are having to ration PPE because they don't have enough for today and will not have enough in the coming weeks. Just like what is happening in Italy right now, the health care providers at Duke hospital and the rest of the hospitals in the nation will be having to make the terrible decision of which patients get to live and which ones have to die. Richard Burr and the rest of the republicans knew this would happen and did absolutely nothing.  Good fucking job republicans.
Actually, President Obama did. Multiple times. Do some reading my dude.
> They must have known they’d fall eventually.  Conservatives, like most executives, are largely incapable of giving due consideration to "eventually". As long as things look great today, or this quarter, nothing else matters.
Additional profits and advance information for wealthy and influential donors is a benefit.
*I* sold my stocks three weeks ago, bud. All my crypto. Which then dropped 50%. Anyone who didn't see this coming THREE WEEKS ago is an absolute cretin. Insider trading, what a LOL you guys are.
If for no other reason than open sewers are unhealthy in general
In a tiny cell would be great.
This is what happens when they put party over country all with the shared goal of saving face with the king idiot. Make sure to thank every GOP senator and their traitorous club for this.
Since when is an audio recording "false"???
I'm not even sure what argument you're trying to make. The article you linked basically lists a few things that were public knowledge at the time that the administration did. Or, in the case of administering tests quickly and efficiently, what the CLAIMED they would do. I guess a crappy half-hearted response with tons of misinformation is technically action, but I usually expect more from leaders.    Burr's address to the state's wealthy was highly detailed and provided them with information that regular people don't have access to. If you think that's not a problem, then I guess we have fundamental philosophical differences.
if your statement wasnt so long i would put it on a bumper sticker and give you 51 percent of the proceeds (net not gross of course)
That and rollovers into other accounts less susceptible to market volatility.
Hey man, good for you. I’m proud of you.
I mean, yes, but some people clearly keep voting R. We could fix this all by... not.
So a lateral move?
❄️❄️❄️❄️
This is your rule 1 warning.
>hole topic assumes we should value it over lives.  The economy has a *huge* effect on lives. To pretend like to prioritize the economy we're ignoring lives is asinine, and completely ignores how the world works. Ever heard of the great depression? 25% unemployment? People starving to death? Families literally selling their kids into slavery for food? This was less than a century ago. In America. It can happen again. We are doing these things to make sure that it won't.
>Anyone and everyone that voted for Burr, or any other republican, is responsible for..... the countless coming COVID-19 death toll, and the crash of the economy.  My reply wasn't a strawman. Learn to read.  People will also die due to job loss and economic downturn. I saw a newscast with Gov Cuomo who actually put it very well. We're fighting 2 battles: 1 is the virus, 2 is the economic impact. We can't ignore one for the other.
> Richard Burr and the rest of the republicans knew this would happen and did absolutely nothing. Good fucking job republicans.  Liar.  https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/coronavirus-prevention-steps-the-u-s-government-is-taking-to-protect-you-sen-alexander-and-sen-burr
Aye. You too.
Not sure I believe people are just plain evil. People always act in their self interest. And sometimes they do it when they’re sure there will be a detriment to others, which is evil. I think in general, when we look at someone and think they’re evil, they are their own hero
Ah, didn’t think about that. And that’s exactly what he was doing. Good point.
Yeah, except nobody gives a fuck about you and you're not a senator.
What is the phrase? Good for me not for thee
Claiming they didn't do anything until after March 15th is false. They were actively working on this in February and made it public.
Politicians purchased cheaply. (Bookended with pics of Burr and Tillis)
I don’t
It doesn’t matter who votes blue. The entire point of gerrymandering is to ensure the red win.
Just admitting all he was all along. What a fucking tool.
I'm not ignorant to the impact of the economy on peoples' lives. For now we haven't seen the full extent of what this virus is going to do to us. Our administrations have failed us from the top down in our response to the virus. I wasn't trying to imply the economy did not matter but that it's the least of our worries at the moment unless it collapses our food supply lines.  We don't live in the 1930's anymore. We posses the power to feed everyone. People only start selling their kids for food when you don't feed them which shouldn't be a problem unless you think the jobless should starve.
> We are doing these things to make sure that it won't.  Democrats are. Republicans are not.
I can read just fine, ad hominem.   Your response was a strawman. This is about the response in the United States, not globally. No one is blaming Republicans for the global events, solely the events in the United States.   By trying to distract with other causes of deaths you are tacitly admitting that you agree Burr and the Republican party hold responsibility for not being more proactive in addressing this crisis.   No one ever said to ignore one for the other, false dichotomy.
The virus and the economic impact could have both been mitigated by taking action earlier. It is apparent that Burr was aware of the risks, and did not chose mitigation.   People will die in the downtown, in part, because of the lack of social safety nets. I hope the sound fiscal position NC is currently in allows for swift and generous action to protect those who are struggling with the economic fallout.
By ignoring the Virus, we have made certain that the economic impact will be tremendous. Businesses are shuttering precisely because the Republicans didn't take it seriously and *every* Republican mouthpiece used their position and time to downplay the impending disaster.      Sure, NC is in a better position than most to address an economic downturn. The unfortunate part is that this downturn *didn't need to happen* because they were too busy covering for each other, giving their wealthy donors real information, and supporting moronic proclamations over the seriousness of this pandemic.
Fox news opinion piece? Just no.
Not asking for your concern, sport. Proving that your "tempest in a teapot" rage is just that—impotent rage. But, keep it up! You're doing more for Trump2020 than I can. We see you losers.
Ive heard Rules for thee, not for me but close enough.
It's literally an OpEd written by Burr himself on what he was working on regarding COVID *over a month ago*. If you don't want to read it, I don't care: You're still wrong. Your ignorance isn't my problem.
The only one losing their cool here is you MAGA dude. I work in finance and no one was talking about unloading their portfolios, shorting but not wholesale selling.   The sometimes there’s a wizard;) amirite? But the very best wizards of all have insider information. Every. Time.  Sport  Edit: Sailor
Just for fun: Do you think Senator Burr acted appropriately here?
Ah that’s it thank you
I can write a bunch of bullshit too, but that doesn't mean fuck all if I spend my time advising my wealthy donors on the impending situation and supporting the president through his ridiculous bullshit about things not being so bad. Any good he might have done by writing an op-ed was wasted by privileging the interest of the wealthy and the president over the interests of North Carolina and the US at large.
How retail. You work in finance and yet no one got deleveraged and rekt? No one else cleared their holdings?? OK, tell *Edward Jones* hello for me
When is selling stock on publicly-available information *inappropriate*? People buy and sell stocks. The market literally FUNCTIONS on information. Myself, I'm buying discounted blue chip stocks and heavily discounted crypto like crazy. What, you expect him to sit there any get hit by a truck anyone with two functioning brain cells could see coming a mile away? I'm being serious. Anyone that wasn't selling at that exact time period either wasn't in the market or shouldn't be. They are absolute fuckwits if they weren't selling. Inappropriate, LOL, you guys
Doing shorts as I said in my post sailor boi. But I’m in ipos so don’t throw your bs in my direction sport. EJ ( yawn) had to Google, sounds like your speed tho.
You didn't answer my question.
You write *paper* and want to talk to me about the ethics of trading? That's RICH. Later.
If you believe that, then I doubt you know what day of the week it is, sailor
I don’t want to talk to you about anything and later doesn’t work for me, it’s never.
Can't answer a question with a question. Bitching and moaning is not yes or no. Did Burr, with some of the best intelligence briefings in the world, do the right thing here?
LOL, [Feinstein sold](https://mobile.twitter.com/RealFacelessMan/status/1240808566761676801) $1M-$5M stock in the same period  Be more of a TDS loser
Best briefings in the world? He acted on publicly available information—which your sources deny was public. Who's lying, again?
Yes or no?

North Carolina man allegedly tests positive for COVID-19, was told to self quarantine for 2-3 weeks, instead livestreams on Facebook inside of a Walmart putting many people at risk.

Coronavirus Preparation
Join r/CoronaNC and help other North Carolinians stay updated and aware of the imminent Coronavirus threat to our state
What’s its fatality rate though? Isn’t it really low?
I don't understand why this sub is necessary. There's dedicated subs to the virus already, making one for North Carolina just seems like karma farming...especially since you have post history in /r/FreeKarma4U. Really weird IMO.
EVERYONE PANIC!!!
Evil twin
Sort of.      To answer your question, the fatality rate is around 2%, which doesn't sound like a lot. However the Flu's fatality rate is 0.1%, so this is 20 times more deadly than the flu.      When you compare it to high fatality rate viruses like MERS or SARS (10%), then it is low. However, MERS and SARS impacted everyone fairly evenly so when you had it you knew it and you weren't out in public spreading it around. What makes COVID-19 more deadly is that 80% of those infected get very mild symptoms, so they think they just have a regular cold and still go out in public, work, etc.      Right now they estimate that 70% of the US population will contract COVID-19, and a vaccine is at least 18 months out. So 327 million times 70% time 2% = 4,578,000 fatalities... **THAT IS A LOT** That is like the entire state of Kentucky dying.      [edit - updated maths]
See r/CoronavirusWA, r/CoronavirusCA, r/CoronaFlorida. I was on Freekarma so nice catch. I wanted to make a post on the awareness of the Chinese Muslim re-education camps and what's going on there during the virus outbreak but I needed 100 karma. I appreciate your opinion!
Or, just be informed and prepared.  I'm not sure who it helps when you mock people who want information.
If you want to lead, you can have the reins. I was following what Washington State was doing.  I also talk directly to the CDC leadership so it was a data collection effort.   Perhaps, you would be open to comoderator for your community. It's up to you
God just needed more Angel's.  Sending thoughts and prayers.
>Right now they estimate that 70% of the US population will contract COVID-19, and a vaccine is at least 18 months out. So 327 million times 2% = 6,544,000 fatalities...    >   >THAT IS A LOT   >   > That is like the entire state of Indiana dying.  Woah. Check your math.  There's 327 million Americans, 70% will contract, and 2% *of those* will die: That's only 4.5 million deaths. Your 2% was based on the entire US population.  Let's also remember the ones dying are typically those who are older and those already susceptible due to other diseases or medical issues. If this virus were to spread, you'll find the fatality rate begin to drop.  No need to freak out. Just wash your hands and keep them away from your face, which is exactly the same way to help prevent any illnesses.
Good catch, not enough coffee yet this morning! Still... 4.5M people is a lot.      I agree about the percentage going down as it spreads simply because we will hopefully have better ideas on how to manage symptoms.      John Oliver has a great summary on it:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c09m5f7Gnic      How worried should we be? Somewhere in between licking subway poles and gargling bleach.

Wake County resident tests positive for coronavirus, governor says

Here it comes. Gonna be a wild ride as this thing spreads through the US
Dang, they probably rode that Alaska Air SEA --> RDU flight.
Honest question: do you think we are at the point where we should be preparing for long stints of staying in-home? I feel like we are still a ways away from that, but then again by the time we are for sure there, it wont be fun to get in and out of the grocery store...
I, for one, welcome our new infected overlords.
WCPSS: I won't have any more off days. We'll be fine. Coronavirus: Hi
Well there goes my plan to stop by Costco on the way home..
EVERYONE CALM THE FUCK DOWN
Stay healthy and safe everyone.
Just remember that like half the people who got the virus have already recovered from it. It's not like you get the virus and you're doomed to quarantine until a vaccine comes out
Look, my grandma got Swine Flu when she was 79, she's still kickin'
While you should be mindful of exposure, keep in mind that the virus has a mortality rate of 1.4%. Most of that percentage is the elderly and the immunocompromised. Don’t panic, but take the necessary precautions to protect those that are most at risk.
This infected person visited a hospital in Washington State then came back to NC.
What is it with these people travelling to infected places and then traveling somewhere else to spread it perfectly even across the states, this is actually scary af
Trump couldn't have bungled this harder
What city
I've been stocking up on canned goods and buying hand sanitizers, soaps, and lysols by the armload for the last two weeks and the cashiers and customers are always looking at me like I'm some kind of kook. Who's crazy now, Deloris? Who's crazy now?
Fuck fuck fuck fuck FUCK
Not sure if anyone has posted this, but... did they not know before they left Washington State, that there were cases at that care center, and that first responders and others have been quarantined ?  So, did they encapsulate themselves for the public good, on their way back, not touch anything, sneeze, cough? Did THIS person KNOW, before traveling???!!!
Stock up on foods and any meds asap. Welfare gets paid out at start of the month so expect Walmarts and grocery stores to be a.mess this week.
Release the name of the infected. People have a right to know!
Everyone is massively overestimating how bad this is. It's not going to be a "wild ride". It's going to be a minor inconvenience, at best. The 24-hour news cycle is spinning this thing out of proportion for the ratings.
They visited the retirement home in Seattle where 2 people recently died from COVID-19.
There’s two direct flights from both Alaska and Delta a day. And from my experience they’re usually packed.
Based on what I’ve read: Preparing, yes. Expecting, not yet. If you can afford to prepare, go ahead and do so. If it would put a strain on things, you can probably wait a bit longer, but at least prepare to prepare.
I've just been stocking up on non-perishables that I'd use during the next year anyway: dried beans, pasta, canned veg and tuna, filling up the freezer with stuff I like. Probably wouldn't even last a month, though, and a very beany month at that.   Best case nothing happens and my grocery bill is slightly lower in the future.
Probably not. Just wash your hands like crazy and don't go out if you have any symptoms. We're not a community that relies on mass public transit and living on top of one another; I severely doubt Raleigh/Wake County turns into a ghost town
Oregon transplant from NC here. Prepare like it's a hurricane on the way. Also, toilet paper, hand sanitizer, and bleach are in high demand. Also tortillas for some reason, but I'm not sure why.  At least y'all know where your cases came from. Our three (afaik) are a mystery. Which means there are really probably hundreds of cases just out there walking around.
China had 17,000 confirmed cases before they quarantined.
We're fucked.  Testing costs so much that they only test obvious cases, so carriers have been out infecting people long before they get tested.  Also muah rights, cant have the gubberment locking me in my house on a whim
You should've stocked up last week
Definitely be ready just in case, but it sounds like the Government doesn't have the stomach to do a full fledged quarantine.
hope so lol i don’t wanna go to school
Shiiiit this explains why Costco looked like the supermart in fallout. Didn't realize average Tuesday was also dooms day
Yes! But also, for the love of god, please wash your hands and be clean.
I AM CALM DAMNIT!
Somewhere in between gargling bleach and licking subway poles.
PACK OF 4 HAND SANITIZERS ONLY COSTS $324 ON AMAZON
Or as Pence's press secretary tweeted today, "take a deep breath."  Really.
What?!?
What the fuck is the logic to that? I can't believe that we are being worse than *China!*
Swine flu almost killed me and I was like 21.
Mortality rate is 3.4 as stated by the WHO today
Above 80 is somewhere around 15%. Hide your grandparents.
i am immunocompromised, yay!
I read that children are actually surprisingly not being affected that badly. Where are you seeing differently?
Children are fine. Please add your sources or correct your numbers if you don't mind.
I thought it had a low mortality rate among children
If you're going to quote numbers, back it up. That's just wrong when you say the CFR includes a higher percentage of children. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus\_disease\_2019#/media/File:Illustration\_of\_SARS-COV-2\_Case\_Fatality\_Rate\_200228\_01-1.png](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019#/media/File:Illustration_of_SARS-COV-2_Case_Fatality_Rate_200228_01-1.png)  This particular virus and disease does affect elderly and patients with underlying health conditions (heart disease, diabetes, respiratory disease, etc) though. Misinformation is just as bad as panicking.
We are being lied to by China and our own Gov't. Just be careful.
Yeah, because there’s no way this person could have visited before the news came out and had no symptoms before getting on the plane
>**According to the news they travelled back from WA feb 22. The news of the outbreak at the nursing home didn’t come out till last weekend. So this person wouldn’t have known.**  I'm beginning to see how the Salem witch trials happened.
They don't know they have it or have been exposed to it.
This part? No. This early spreading would have been hard ton stop. The part that comes next will be the real opportunity for him to bungle as per usual.
What is he suppose to do lockdown everything???
You’re right he should have waited until 20,000 infected and 1,000 deaths before doing anything like the Obama administration did with H1N1. I don’t why the fuck he banned travel from China or Iran or Italy too. What a fucktard.
Raleigh  Edit: sorry, the first story I read had raleigh but looks like with time they have edited the news story. News and Observer has now reported that he flew into RDU but says that they don’t know where he or she resides.
Same. And seeing all the store shelf photos circulating, I’m so glad I did!
It's not the end of the world. Wash your hands, buy an extra box of pasta from the store. 99.9% of us will be fine.
COVID-19 has an incubation  period of up to 14 days. I'm guessing they planned the trip, went, and came back before the outbreak was ever discovered. I'm also willing to bet they didn't expose themselves and presumably the aircraft they traveled on *on purpose*.
According to the news they travelled back from WA feb 22. The news of the outbreak at the nursing home didn’t come out till last weekend. So this person wouldn’t have known.
r/CoronaNC
Get your stuff before the filthy poors get their hands on it. /s
That is actually happening in Asia, posting names and where they work, if I'm correct. I can't remember which country is doing that though... It is not to "incriminate", it is to make connections with others who may have come into contact.
Ridic.
I’d rather we treat it like a big deal than not and regret it.
Doctor here. It is more contagious than the flu and has 20x the mortality. That’s bad. If you know something I don’t know, then it is appropriate to be concerned.
Do you remember when the news media was all "Hurricane Florence might be a big deal!" and people were like "THAT'S WHAT U SAID ABOUT HURRICANE MARIA LOL NEWSMEDIA" and Wilmington was all "hey nobody come back for a while."
I see you have no one in your life that you care about that's 65+ or immunocompromised.
Agreed, this is Fake News manufactured by the deep state liberal media to disrupt this years election.  Keep America Great myRed blooded komrades
What the fuck kind of response is that
You’re still bitter about the fucking Whalers.
(X) Doubt
Wait...... visited?!?!? So they were there for a couple hours and left? For me, that seems insanely contagious
Oh wow, didn't realize there was a Delta one also. Yeah, every time I take that Alaska flight it's pretty damn full.
The best advice is to pick up a few extra things each grocery trip, rather than go on a massive purchasing rampage.
Good advice. Also, worst case, you have a hurricane prep kit.  I do expect things to get shutdown for a while. I can't imagine non-essential personnel at school and jobs unless they're...... well..... essential
Bulk Dried beans are wiped out of the two walmarts I go to. I imagine tortillas are a great complement to pinto / black beans. Add some rice and meat and baby you've got a fajita / burrito going.
I bought tortillas bc they are a good bread alternative and generally Last quite a while
Which defeats the point entirely.
Because we don't need a full fledged quarantine...
Me either but at least fourth period for me is fun
Cover your coughs and sneezes, don't spread it around!
How often should we be washing our hands? After the bathroom, of course. After touching something?
Thoughts and prayers
the guy who tried to pray away aids....
That’s fucking hilarious I can’t even be mad at the irony of that.
See the footnote marks here.... and the map https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-in-us.html
Easy, Trump wants to be reelected bby saying the economy is great. He sees this as a threat to the economy. If we pretend no one is sick, the economy is okay... right?
Well Swine Flu was H1N1, which is also the same type of strain as Spanish Flu. It's a strain that kills far more young people than elderly so I'm not entirely surprised you would have a tougher time. This thing, however, is the complete opposite.
Just to back this up [here's a website that tracks confirmed cases](https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6). It's run by Johns Hopkins and uses global health organizations for information. I've been using it for weeks now and it's been quite accurate. Had Wake County added within a few minutes of the governor's announcement.
I was going off of what the article said, but if that’s what the WHO says then it’s probably a little more accurate.
Correct me if I’m wrong because I haven’t seen this, but wouldn’t that 3.4 percentage include the entire world where access healthcare isn’t as good?
This is not including mild cases that aren't reporting
That is correct.
Children are often exposed to other coronaviruses in daycare and school, you know how kindergarteners are always sick/getting others sick? That exposure is enough to keep their immunity riled up but that effect wanes as we age and this is why it starts to become problematic age 30 and above.
I edited it yesterday.
As said above: According to the news they travelled back from WA feb 22. The news of the outbreak at the nursing home didn’t come out till last weekend. So this person wouldn’t have known.
I know it's not on purpose
Quarantining people coming from infected areas would be a start lol, instead of literally just letting them and people treating them mix with everyone else
Not put the guy who exacerbated a HIV outbreak in his home state in charge?
The H1N1 with a .02% mortality rate? That H1N1?
I haven’t seen the city listed anywhere, Source? All coverage I’ve seen has just said wake County
Ok... I'll take that for what it's worth, and truly hope it is so. I sincerely do hope that this person had no knowledge of what was going on there.

The problem is that blowing it out of proportion can actually make it worse.  Example: everyone buying up all the masks they can find so that medical providers don't have enough.  When they don't have enough, they either can't provide care to those who need it or they are put at increased risk of contracting the virus and then can't provide care to anyone.
We could name literally thousands of other things that are a bigger deal than this that you currently are not treating like a big deal and could regret it.  To name a few, your drive into work today was more dangerous than the coronavirus, your dinner is probably not as healthy as it could be, your chances of dying from heart disease are thousands of times higher, other sicknesses that you weren’t worried about had/have a higher chance of getting you.  But we aren’t up in arms about getting people out of cars, eating healthier, or putting on the news every hour someone died of the normal flu, so this shouldn’t be any different other than it has caught everyone’s attention, whether it’s relevant or not.
Its massively underdiagnosed. Most people display mild to moderate cold symptoms. Surely as a doctor you'd understand why someone wouldn't bother seeing you for a mild cold.  I expect that there are thousands, if not hundreds of thousands more people infected than the current confirmed cases suggest. This means the mortality rate is well below what you are saying, and it really is only high risk to those over the age of 60.
Mortality rate for people under 50 is at 0.2% via WHO and CDC. It's the >50 that is worrying
Given that for many cases this seems to feel like a cold, isn't there a good chance that this is massively underdiagnosed and therefore the mortality rate overstated? Who even goes to a doc for a cold? I wouldn't be surprised if this virus had been circulating in the US for  while already.
Yuck
A trolling one, judging by a 5 second look at their profile
It only takes one sick person to cough on you to get the common cold.
went on massive purchasing rampage, going to stay away from public places like grocery stores for awhile. Do what ever you feel is best for you and your family. Im a cautious person and i'll do my part, to limit exposure and spreading if i do get symptoms.
like bread you can freeze them to last longer, but they take up a lot less space in the freezer than a loaf of bread
Or rather, a full quarantine wouldn't help at this point.
China quarantined 700 million people for this virus and it worked. We’ve quarantined no one outside of the people who visited China so far and now we have 9 people dead and an unknown amount of cases in the wild.
mine isn’t but i get a free period next year so it’s all good i guess
Yes, after touching objects in public. If you're shopping, try not to touch your face until you can sanitize your hands.
Every couple of hours would probably be good. I have no idea, it just sounds right to me.
When you go anywhere public, wear any face covering (balaclava, bandana, etc) to remind yourself not to touch your face / mouth / nose. I also advise some glasses or goggles. When you get back in your car, use clorox wipes on your hands before removing your coverings and / or scratching your face.
LOOT THE COSTCOS!
HeALiNg ViBes!
So, they're updated daily at noon, for cases up to 4pm the day before. That's not "not reporting", that's batching. Thanks. I'm much less indignant now.
Which is great for me and my kids, terrible for my parents and grandparents.
What about our healthcare accessibility is good?
It cant be 3.4  So many unconfirmed cases in places that don't test.  80% of people have little to no symptoms while also being contagious themselves.  Especially in kids.  Let it get into a school and its going to spread like wild fire with little notice until a staff member gets sick many days after it has been spread.  Each kid goes home to a family and spreads it like crazy.  The family members go to work or church, gas stations, grocery stores, public event, voting booth or whatever.  This is going to get out of control rapidly.  It is much more contagious than the flu.  And I believe hard times are coming.  :(  edit: its most likely closer to between .5% and 1.5%.  But still millions can die...
Look you aren’t wrong but do you understand the backlash if they quarantined everyone from those areas?  Regardless of how poor his character maybe when the media over dramatizes everything and has attacked him more negative than and president in history largely due to party affiliation; then it’s impossible to make an aggressive conservative decision like mandated quarantine.  It’s out now,  all they can do at this point is prepare medical facilities, incentivize the pharmaceutical companies to work towards a cure, and carefully educate the population.  Media presentation of this virus is causing panic when we just do not know much about it.
Sorry i didn’t realize a low mortality rate was the only reason to try and stop a pandemic of new illness. I’m sure those high cost of health care appreciated it not killing many people.
See edit above
Medical providers are not buying their masks from the local hardware or grocery store
I agree, but I think we can both treat it like a big deal and hopefully be smart about things like you point out. I would say we just need to listen to our health officials, but it seems this administration has made that an issue too.
You not eating a healthy dinner isn't going to potentially cripple the world economy for the better part of a year. I've heard estimates based on growth rates of new cases that within a year 40-70% of the world's population could have contracted the disease. With as little as we know about re-infection and the disease, I'd say that's a pretty decent thing to worry about.  Is it teotwawki? No, it's not about to turn into the walking dead out there. Should people, and by people I mean *everyone*, be readying themselves for potential *severe* disruptions to supply chains and workforce demands worldwide? Abso-fucking-lutely.
Yeah your probably smarter then everyone working on this and they didnt take that into account.
https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cnbc.com/amp/2020/03/03/who-says-coronavirus-death-rate-is-3point4percent-globally-higher-than-previously-thought.html
meh...... kinda. Common Cold and Flu are all around us. The R0 must really be between a 3 and 8
You're part of the problem. People like you are worse than the virus itself.
It worked so well that it is now a global pandemic?
Cool
Those of us that work in shops will just get sick, of course.
THIS GUY LOOTS
That's what scares me most honestly, me and my husband are 31 and 30 respectively. My parents though are in their mid 60's. I know me and my mate are probably gonna be fine, but really I'm scared of how badly this is gonna hit my folks if it comes to that. Dad has had a bad history with pnuemonia and his lungs arent that great. Add to it heart problems run on his side of the family so...yeah, not quite a panic here, but still. I'm very much aware of the situation.
I mean compared to rural china it has to be better lol
I mean our access to it is definately higher, it's just the bill afterwards that is a problem
>maybe when the media over dramatizes everything and has attacked him more negative than and president in history largely due to party affiliation;  Yikes
Extremely low. Coronavirus is 170 times deadlier
But those hardware stores and grocery stores order them from the same places that hospitals and urgent cares order them.  That means that the supply is decreased until the distributors are forced to withhold them for medical providers only.  Don't forget that online orders likely come from the same places as well.  The fact of the matter is that there is a finite supply and excessive panic purchasing can lead to supply issues for the people that really need them.

That's not including mild cases and that's also including Iran treating their patients with steroids.
The last estimate I saw was 2.6
I'm inclined to believe the r0 is much higher than is being reported.
part of the problem? i bought enough food for me to not go out for a few weeks. I have no desire to mingle around while i could get infected or infect those around me if i become sick.
China's main mistake was doing the quarentine about 3 weeks too late, if not more. Oh, and also accidentally releasing a biohazard from a lab in the middle of a gigantic city. That was another mistake I guess.
All healthcare has one fatal flaw: capacity. 20% of cases require hospitalization. If too many people get infected too quickly, it's going to fill up hospitals.
Honestly questionable
which is why many of us just won't go to the doctor or hospital unless it's life or death to us.
>Iran treaing their patients with steroids.  Dafuq.
may I suggest you read up on the prisoner's dilemma  your actions create false scarcity that drives more fear and scarcity that leads to far from ideal distribution of resources, wasting of resources, and people having to go without needed resources.  but, people don't care. they operate on the 'fuck you, got mine' principle.
If 10% of the population hoards food, all of a sudden the rest of us can't just go out and get the things we need to live normally. Then comes the panic and the rioting.
> releasing a biohazard from a lab in the middle of a gigantic city  What do you mean by this?
US healthcare has a couple of added flaws, namely insurance coverage and sick leave or, rather, the lack of both. People will stay at work longer because they don't have leave (or have enough leave) to stay home if they feel sick. And when they get sick, the cost of healthcare can be prohibitively expensive, meaning some will also forego treatment (and testing). So we've got that going for us, which is nice... </s>
Yeah most people cant afford to get sick from this thing and wind up in quarantine in the hospital being charged for each day.
if 10% of the population took this serious maybe it could save the elderly or sick. just saying. not pushing panic but being prepared is not necessarily hording.
 I mean a level-4 microbiology lab research facility, only 4 blocks from the Wuhan market  where the outbreak appears to have began, has been doing research on sars and bats for years. There's speculation and some evidence that this virus accidentally escaped that facility.
I've had a fever for the past couple days but have no insurance so there's no way I'm going to the doctor. For all I know I could have the corona virus right now but I'll probably never find out for sure. Honestly it's probably just the regular flu but I've just decided to quarantine myself at home anyways because I don't want to get anyone else sick regardless.
Y u p.  Also, love the username.
You said just above that you went on a "massive purchasing rampage". That is hoarding, and it is bad.

[bnonews] NEW: North Carolina reports first case of coronavirus


First North Carolina novel coronavirus case confirmed in Wake County

I think people are greatly underestimating the number of infections. In the US, the CDC will only allow you to be tested after they screened you and determined your symptoms strongly signify the virus. I came back from Japan with a cough and a headache and called a triage nurse who talked with an infectious disease expert that said I don't qualify for testing, but told me to go isolate myself for 2 weeks. And that is after traversing 3 international airports, stores, restaurants, public transpo, etc and I am one of many similar people. It is out there, the spreading is underway. Just stay away from elderly and ill. DO NOT just show up at a hospital if you suspect you have it.  I think the only realistic solution is to do everything we can to limit the chances of elderly or ill people from getting it. It is much less difficult than trying to contain billions of active individuals
RALEIGH, N.C. (WTVD) -- One person has tested positive for the novel coronavirus in Wake County, health officials said Tuesday.  In a news release, Cooper said the patient is currently at home in isolation.  "I know that people are worried about this virus, and I want to assure North Carolinians our state is prepared," Cooper said in a written statement. "Our task force and state agencies are working closely with local health departments, health care providers and others to quickly identify and respond to cases that might occur."  Officials said the patient contracted the virus after visiting a nursing home in Seattle, Wash., that is linked to seven deaths related to the novel coronavirus.
How old are they?
This is super close to the school, and it worries me.
Some experts forecast that 40-70% of the world population will be infected with COVID-19 in the next year. And presumably most of us within a couple more years.   https://amp.theatlantic.com/amp/article/607000/  “Lipsitch predicts that within the coming year, some 40 to 70 percent of people around the world will be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19. But, he clarifies emphatically, this does not mean that all will have severe illnesses. “It’s likely that many will have mild disease, or may be asymptomatic,” he said. As with influenza, which is often life-threatening to people with chronic health conditions and of older age, most cases pass without medical care. (Overall, about 14 percent of people with influenza have no symptoms.)  Lipsitch is far from alone in his belief that this virus will continue to spread widely. The emerging consensus among epidemiologists is that the most likely outcome of this outbreak is a new seasonal disease—a fifth “endemic” coronavirus. **With the other four, people are not known to develop long-lasting immunity.** If this one follows suit, and if the disease continues to be as severe as it is now, “cold and flu season” could become “cold and flu and COVID-19 season.””
Yeah, Oregon found this out over the weekend, with 3 cases showing up. Two are from people who haven't traveled, and the third got it from one of them at home.

NEW: North Carolina reports first case of coronavirus


Coronavirus confirmed in Wake County


First North Carolina novel coronavirus case confirmed in Wake County

Oh joy.
Fucks sake

With news of the Coronavirus case in NC, I feel now there is even more reason that if you haven’t voted yet, please make it to the polls today! You have until 7:30pm!
Look. It may seem in bad taste to “politicize a crisis”, but the reality is that crisis’s SHOULD be handled with assistance of public policy! In times like this (virus outbreaks) it makes it more obvious that health care is not just about personal insurance. We don’t live in a vacuum –healthcare is tied to the public in many ways and should be a public good available to everyone. Make your vote matter and vote for the candidate who is supporting Medicare For All, Bernie Sanders.No, voting for Bernie today won’t affect this current outbreak, but in the future if M4A is available it could curb the spread of future epidemics and will help people get the care they need when they need it instead of fear of missing work (and thus losing their families healthcare tied to it) or fear of astronomical bills from preventative testing, care, etc.America’s profits from insurance and lack of affordable/comprehensive healthcare is embarrassing. It took me less than 10 mins to vote this morning. It may be a little longer with after work folks. Please make an effort to go vote. AND THEN WASH YOUR HANDS! ❤ stay safe, ya’ll
Voting for Bernie doesn’t make corona virus go away.
Thanks, no.
I respect the message you’re putting out, but healthcare is one of the major reasons I’m not voting for Bernie.  America’s healthcare is not perfect, by any means. It’s bloated and costly, but it also is statistically the best in the world in terms of quality of care. Compared to the UK, Canada, Cuba, just about any country you care to name, we have better ER wait times, less chance of dying in hospital, less chance of dying from a preventable disease. Nationalized healthcare does spread the offerings, but it severely impacts the quality of care being offered. Which would be fine if it was a system you could opt into, but Bernie’s plan makes it mandatory you abandon a plan you may have bought or negotiated for. Couple that all with an eye watering 30 TRILLION price tag over ten years, and no, I’ll keep what we have.
Here is the thing about Medicare for all. What incentive does a person have to become a doctor when Medicare pay many doctors less per hour than an electrician, plumber or car mechanic makes?  How can a hospital stay open and bring in new technology?  They can’t. Initially with Medicare for all, there may not be a noticeable difference in the standard of care but where there is no profit or competition, there is no innovation and no quality of care.
Honestly, I'd rather vote for someone who wants to do *something* to overhaul healthcare than someone who doesn't have it anywhere on their priority list. Nobody recently other than Obama has actually made a serious attempt at overhauling healthcare. We wouldn't need national healthcare if shit wasn't so damn expensive and the insurance industry wasn't so terrible. Most of the country is one medical emergency from bankruptcy, including people who are currently middle class.  *That's* the complaint. If it wasn't a choice between good health and bankruptcy, people wouldn't be pushing for national coverage. The US health industry is one place where the "free market" and capitalism has fallen flat on its face.
> What incentive does a person have to become a doctor when Medicare pay many doctors less per hour than an electrician, plumber or car mechanic makes?  Doesn't seem to be an issue in other countries that have national medicine. People still become doctors and things still get done just fine.  >where there is no profit or competition  Under a for-profit model, what incentive does the company/hospital have to cure someone? After all, the more the person has to come in, the more money the hospital/company makes.  I can agree with you on the competition point, however we're also running into a lack of competition in many places. In smaller towns and cities, there may only be one hospital and a couple urgent care places. It's also likely those are owned by the same company or religious organization. Hospitals are like ISPs: You might have a few choices in a major city, but you only have one out in the sticks.
I would argue it’s fallen flat because it’s just barely a free market, healthcare and insurance is one of the most heavily regulated markets in our country. There’s some merit to why it should be that way, but anywhere you heap that kind of regulation and fees and overhead, you risk bloating the industry to the point where it has to run exorbitant costs to make sure they can stay viable.  The big healthcare push on the right is to dismantle Obamacare, which was thwarted and now they don’t really know what to do next. It’s a catch 22, where by making the kind of deregulations that would be necessary to see long term improvement, you’d have to go through the short term transition period which will be difficult for everyone, particularly middle and lower class. You can’t run on that platform, it’s political suicide. But by continually kicking this can down the road, we get to this frustrating more we see today. It’s not unique by any means- a similar situation is the longstanding promise of pulling our troops out of Afghanistan.  I can understand the mentality of “we have to do *something*”, I just think that kind of thinking can be irresponsible if not tempered with some caution and critical thinking. There’s a whole lot of “somethings” we could do for a lot of problems our country has, but we don’t because they create bigger problems down the line.
I agree with you about the lack of competition, look at Mission in Asheville after being bought out and how fast their quality of care went down after. Hospitals have incentives to cure people, that allows them to see more people. They want to buy the latest technology and people will travel to a hospital that has better technology. Do you want to have an MRI done in a 20 year old machine that is loud and tiny or do you want to have one in a newer machine that is much quieter, roomier and does a higher quality image in less time for the same price?  I work with doctors. One thing I noticed when the ACA was passed is that the ones that could retired or went to other industries. These were the more experienced doctors that cared more about their patients and entire business. Now you have much younger, less experienced doctors that are there for a paycheck. This isn’t always the case but I have noticed it.   One thing most people don’t know and look over is that even though the ACA aka Obamacare was placed into law by politicians, the group that helped write it and benefitted the most is the insurance companies. Premiums and deductibles have increase while coverage has decreased. Reimbursement rates by insurance companies to physicians have decreased. They blame the physicians and that may be true for some but for most it isn’t.  If a doctor wants to make $50 for a procedure, they have to inflate the charge to around $150. Insurance companies have to have the illusion that they are getting patients a discount, then you have government payers that pay very little then they have to collect copay and deductibles from patient. Then you have patient that don’t have anything and others that don’t pay to the doctor and default. So if a doctor does 10 procedures and need to make $50/procedure and you have 5 government payers (Medicare or Medicaid) and 5 insurance payers, they will get about $15 for the government later and about $90 from the insurance payers which averages about to $50.50.

I completely agree. /u/Fungus_Schmungus, I don't think locking conversation on an official update from Sen Jackson ([link](https://www.reddit.com/r/NorthCarolina/comments/ffyc62/nc_coronavirus_update_latest_on_of_infected_and/)) was a good idea.  There was enough information in that update worthy of its own thread.  Hell, half the conversation in this megathread is complaining about not being able to discuss each of submissions individually and I tend to agree.  Discussion of the merits of closing schools, for example, shouldn't be lumped in here where it will become difficult to find among the other comments unrelated to closing schools.
Exactly, it’s not like you have to separate because it is so huge that things are being overrun. This is a small subreddit an important to the people of North Carolina. Every single post should have it’s own comments and information
A lot of subreddits are doing the same, it's just too much to allow everyone post every possible article and opinion about COVID-19... information overload.
Can you be more specific as to what you're asking for?  Is the locking of threads a problem, or is the composition of the front page and visibility of links a problem?  As of this comment, three of the top six front page submissions are related to the coronavirus.
Morrisville, not Mooresville
Did they find out in Boston they had the virus or did they come home and potentially spread it?
Just swamp the sub till they get the idea.
Very peculiar. The article is clear that these 5 folks are in isolation in their wake county homes. Anyone have any idea why these five have not been picked up by JHU’s tracker yet?  Edit: all is well—tracker picked it up and is now being reflected!
Way ahead of ya. Pastor said it was a sin.
[https://www.reddit.com/r/CutYourOwnHair](https://www.reddit.com/r/CutYourOwnHair)
Ask them to wash their hands first maybe?
Check the news. They just found 5 more confirmed cases today, including a guy who passed right through Charlotte Douglas Airport from Italy. The disease us already all over the state but thanks to our incompetent leadership noone is being tested. Our students and faculty are not safe. This virus is extremely dangerous. We need to protect these kids and their family member who will get exposed as well as our teachers who deserve to be protected. I can promise you once they actually start testing there will be thousands who test positive all across the state.
School hasn't even been cancelled in wake
Shuttering has proven to be ineffective at controlling the spread of this virus.
Or Shelby?
/u/JeffJacksonNC's post is still visible, and allowing comments on that thread (among others) defeats the very purpose of this one.  edit: His submission is now unlocked, and this megathread is now effectively obsolete.
As long as the thread abides by forum rules, there's no reason it should be treated differently than any other thread.  I personally think there's an overload of low effort sunset/lighthouse/peoples back yard photos, but I'm not advocating those threads be killed.
Yes, locking the threads is the problem, it's discouraging discussion.   I'm fine with the idea of a megathread to consolidate information, but I don't think we should be locking every coronavirus thread.
They found out in nc
I'm sure they are attempting it. I mean anytime news happens, 3-15 articles of the same thing fight it out for karma.
Yeah, isolated after 11 days!
Flights are coming in from Italy every day and the travelers are not even spoken to, much less screened. It’s scary and the incompetence and inept response is truly amazing
Yes, testing kits are few and far between, but does not mean we need to close up like Italy at this time.
Did not say they were nor believe it is necessary.
I think it's more accurate to say that it's not being implemented effectively rather than it doesn't work.  We are letting people self-quarantine and then they are going out to big public events and spreading the virus.
You are making the wrong call on this. Try out megathreads on something that isn't a health emergency.
So are you of the opinion that a megathread is meant to provide quick access to all relevant links, but that it shouldn't actually be a place for discussion of those links and all original submissions should be visible and functional as if the megathread didn't exist?  edit: The downvotes are ridiculous, guys.
I mean I get it, but rather than locking the more popular post or update posts just leave them be and take down copies of the same stories, but more work and I do appreciate the mods, but, there's a better way than to lock everything and dump it in a mega thread that won't marry not get its attention back.
This is so scary. They’re all Wake county residents that were probably eating in the finest restaurants and drinking in the best bars. Crowded, intimate places.
It is already done. I guarantee if they started testing tomorrow en masse you would be horrified by the number of people already infected. I wont even go into a gas station or restaurant right now.   People here have been lied to. If you look at what is happening in Italy right now this is our very near future. 3 weeks ago they had almost no cases. Now the entire country is under quarantine.
It also doesn't mean we *shouldn't*.  The absence of data is not evidence of absence, we have little idea, and considering the lack of competent governmental response and low hundreds of tests supplied to NC, we can either err on the side of caution or recklessness in that climate of uncertainty and low information.   My question to you, is any part of the US response or infection rate indicative we won't have to close up like Italy sooner or later?
I was being sarcastic
Would you prefer we lock everyone up that we believe may have the virus? Where would we put them?
This subreddit sees topics that would justify a megathread *at best* once or twice per year.
Hello. Everything should be unlocked and information should flow freely. You're doing a great job as a mod but I think it this subreddit isn't a major one so megathreads don't work as well. Just my 2c
Megathreads sink to the bottom, and stifle sharing of information.
I think that's the best way to handle it.  Having a list of links in a megathread is nice (especially if older "Latest updates" are removed and replaced with newer "Latest updates" links or at least given dates) and it's nice to have general conversation here, but conversation should still be allowed on the individual posts.  For me, I didn't even know there was a megathread until I saw Sen Jackson's post pop up on my front page.  I clicked to go to the comment section and the only thing was a link to this megathread.  So I come to the megathread where I've had to expand all comment threads to see if there's any conversation about Sen Jackson's update.  It just introduces so many extra steps and hurdles when someone might just be interested in finding discussion on a certain aspect of this COVID-19 topic.  Also, most people don't specifically come to the subreddit directly, but just look at what gets populated on their front page so that also creates far less engagement with stickied megathreads like this.  I think restricting comments would work better for things like election results and such where lots of news is coming in at a very quick pace.  COVID-19 news doesn't exactly come all that quickly and there are so many things related to it that trying to condense all discussion in to a megathread just doesn't work well in my opinion.
I'm in favor of allowing discussion of the coronavirus both here and in other posts.  r/news, r/worldnews, r/raleigh (and I'm sure countless other subs) all have coronavirus megathreads, but still allow individual posts and discussion related to the topic.
A guy in my school's mother met up with one of the biogen people that had it yikessss
No, I do not see the entire United States to close shop, maybe a few states though if things get out of hand.  China did not completely shutdown, only the affected provences.
Were you, though?  /s
I'd prefer we implement an actual quarantine for people who are suspected to have it rather than trust people to quarantine themselves, which has not worked very well so far.  Ask the school in Missouri that has to close because some selfish father thought it was more important to take his daughter to a dance than to observe the quarantine instructions he was given.
Then it just seems arbitrary and unwise for you to try it out now on this particular topic.
Users in this subreddit have been begging for megathread capability for years.
Maybe we should have the opposite thing: a lighthouse megathread to clear more room for posts about the outbreak
So to be perfectly clear, what you want is a stickied mod post, not a megathread.  We don't have the time or energy to curate news updates like they do on default subs, so you'd likely get a very brief mod submission that gets stickied to the top of the front page with a handful of relevant *article* links (like they're currently doing on /r/raleigh).  It *might* get updated daily, but probably not, and it'd get a smattering of comments that would go without responses until the thread got un-stickied (we've done it before and it got zero traction).  You said yourself that folks don't visit the sub directly and only see rising submissions, so to the vast majority of our subscriber base the mod post would be invisible.  We wouldn't touch standalone submissions, so the front page would continue to be flooded with repetitive posts where the same discussion happens in parallel all over the sub, and any other kind of topic that gets posted would get buried.  No submission links would be aggregated (like they do at /r/politics), and the front page would continue to be populated and voted on as if the mod post didn't exist in any capacity.  If that's what people want, then fine.  It's not what folks asked us to do when we brought on an extra moderator to program a bot for this purpose because their concern was a flooded front page.  It is certainly a lot easier on us, though, if we can just hands-off the whole issue every time a single topic gets significant traction.  We'd love to just let voting sort itself out.  We just don't want to be criticized (again) for not trying to corral traffic when something major happens and we get a deluge of submissions that all essentially repeat themselves.  edit: Instant downvotes.  Great work, everybody.
/r/news (23 moderators) and /r/worldnews (100+ moderators) both have over 20 million subscribers, and /r/raleigh simply has a stickied mod thread that doesn't actually aggregate related submission links.  If folks just want a stickied mod thread then we'd love to provide one because it would mean considerably less work for us.  As it stands, however, users have consistently pushed us to create a megathread that unclutters the front page and directs discussion to a single location.  If what folks want instead is a free flow of information and discussion, I'm not sure it's worth doing a megathread at all.  We've been relentlessly criticized for not doing it, and now we're being criticized for doing it.
But China had a competent (if aggressive) containment and testing response. It *did* completely shut down impacted provinces, and it shut them down early, while we are still open for business nationwide.  Right now you can take a cruise, dock in washington, fly on your 3 stop flight, and be licking doorknobs in a public school in NC the next day, no tracking of exposure, no testing, no containment. How does China's lesson apply to the US' completely opposite response?
Back to my question, where to you quarantine all the possible people? Even in countries like China and Italy, quarantine is basically telling people to stay home and not take unnecessary trips.
Ha... Damned of you do and damned if you don't :/
I don't think anyone wants to see duplicate conversations.  If, for example, ABC and NBC articles are submitted about the exact same thing, sure, remove one of them as a duplicate since it's already been covered.  But discussion of official updates on testing capacity and discussion of the merits of closing schools aren't duplicates and are very different topics.  COVID-19 is a broad topic with a lot to discuss and it's going to happen slowly as new information and decisions from authorities are made over time.  I think megathreads are far better suited for big news events that happen quickly with a flood of news outlets all reporting the same thing - things like school shootings, election results, car chases, major fires, etc.
Thanks for understanding :) you do a great job but the megathread + all posts locked is not the right thing at this time. It’s stifling discussion on different topics
Early you say? The alarm was sounded in December, but took them February to respond.  We are not a totalitarian nation, so actions they have done would not be accepted here.
And here's a [great example](https://old.reddit.com/r/raleigh/comments/fd23zz/megathread_novel_coronovirus19/fk3jkk6/) of that, from the /r/Raleigh megathread on Corona.
The megathread has been turned off and we will continue to let people post whatever they want whenever they want.  We will only remove identical links and rehosted content, per rule 4.  The composition of the front page is up to you.  Best of luck.

North Carolina coronavirus patient arrived at RDU 10 days before testing positive


'We expect more cases:' First look at timeline of Wake County coronavirus arrival, show of symptoms and current status


Coronavirus Update
The person in Wake county with the coronavirus was a member of a Cary church and ate at a restaurant in Cameron Village.[https://www.cbs17.com/news/local-news/wake-county-news/wake-county-coronavirus-patient-is-member-of-cary-church-pastor-confirms/](https://www.cbs17.com/news/local-news/wake-county-news/wake-county-coronavirus-patient-is-member-of-cary-church-pastor-confirms/)
There's also a second NC case in Chatham county according to the wonderful tracker at plague.com.

New coronavirus case diagnosed in North Carolina, officials say


NC Coronavirus Update - Latest on # of infected and outlook for more testing
As the coronavirus outbreak continues, there is some confusion and misinformation about what is happening in North Carolina.Here are the facts as of March 9, 1:30 p.m.:**Current Status: Two Cases in North Carolina**Wake County - Individual traveled from State of Washington, where they were exposed at a long-term care facility. The person is doing well and is in isolation at home.Chatham County - Individual traveled to Italy and also had contact with someone who was confirmed positive in Georgia. The person is doing well and is in isolation at home.In addition, an individual in Spartanburg, SC, who has tested positive recently returned from Italy through Charlotte's airport. There are currently NO reported cases in Mecklenburg.**Current Testing Roadblocks**NC has begun testing cases at the NC State Laboratory of Public Health, which allows for faster results (24-hour turnaround time).However, NC has not received the number of kits we had hoped to receive from the CDC. Two factors are making this a more critical situation.  * First, the CDC changed their testing guidelines to increase the number of people who should be tested.  * Second, the case in Chatham County will likely result in a need for more tests.The laboratory supplies we have on-hand from the CDC are only adequate to test approximately 150 individuals. Additional supplies en route to NC, however those incoming shipments will only allow us to test an additional 500 people, far below what is needed under the new CDC guidance. In addition, a small portion of our supplies will be earmarked to perform confirmatory testing for our state’s clinical laboratory partners – per federal requirements – while they implement their own testing for COVID-19.Our NC DHHS sent a letter to Secretary Azar explaining the situation and critical need for more test kits. They have been in contact with our federal delegation and have had communication with the White House.**Testing Outlook**Our NC DHHS signed an agreement with UNC on Wednesday and Duke on Thursday so they can begin testing\*.\* UNC will be able to start testing early this week. We are still waiting on confirmation for the Duke timeline. However, the shortage of testing kits from the CDC will also hamper their ability to test the number of people we should be testing based on the new CDC guidance.In addition, LabCorps will begin testing in the next couple of weeks. They have a 3-4 day turnaround time at this point. They will be using their own test so they won't be limited by the CDC supply issues. LabCorps will eventually help some of the volume, but it will take time to ramp up. Also, that turnaround time is a challenge because the folks that LabCorps test will need to stay quarantined 3-4x longer than the ones we test (assuming they're negative - positives will have the same isolation period). **State Preparation & Constituent Resources**Last month, Governor Roy Cooper established the COVID-19 Task Force to support the state’s ongoing effort to monitor, prepare for and respond to COVID-19.He also ordered the creation of the COVID-19 Helpline toll free at 1-866-462-3821. To ask questions online NC citizens should visit [www.ncpoisoncontrol.org](http://www.ncpoisoncontrol.org/) and select “chat.”**Requests for the Public**If and when community transmission accelerates, then slowing the rate of infection will be key to making sure our hospitals are not overwhelmed. Follow these recommendations not just to protect yourself and your family, but to help slow the overall rate of infection to make sure that our hospitals don't get hit all at once:* Wash your hands several times a day with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer if soap and water are not available.* Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your sleeve (not your hands) when coughing or sneezing.* Avoid exposure to others who are sick.* Stay home when you are ill.I will keep you posted as we learn more.\- Sen.

NC governor declares state of emergency as state deals with coronavirus

This is a good thing, not something to panic about. This lets NC access extra funding to mitigate this.
I watched the press conference and it boils down to this:   1. People over 65 are advised to avoid large gatherings and travel. 2. Employers in the Triangle are advised to utilized work from home to the greatest extent possible.  Both are suggestions only at this point, but everything is subject to change.
this shits getting scary I’m just glad for once the state is at least trying to get out in front of this.
It gets real if public schools and daycares are forced to suspend operation.  That will be a big hit to the economy if it happens.  Roughly a fifth of the 10 million people in NC are under the age of 18.  Hundreds of thousands of people will not be able to go to work if the schools and daycares are closed.
So I wonder how this will effect the ACC tournament coming up in Greensboro? Is adequate preparations being made for that?  Or an even better question: The Furniture Market in a few weeks. There will be an estimated 75,000 additional people from all over (the world) coming into North Carolina.  Most will be specifically in the Piedmont area.  While I am sure it is a nice boost to the economy, what is more important, dollars or people’s health?
Thank you Governor Cooper for stepping in when the white house has failed us so hard.

Since the guy in the WH thinks it’s contained ,against all evidence to the contrary, it’s up to state governments to take care of people. Luckily we have a governor who is up to the task.  This was so predictable. A guy who slurs his words and tweets Coveffe is not someone you want in a crisis.
How many cases have we had? We are around 7 or so, right?
This is going to get a lot worse.
UNC System just updated its response.  https://www.newsobserver.com/news/coronavirus/article241244291.html  The UNC System announced Tuesday that all universities across the state will make changes to keep students off campus for the Spring 2020 semester, including forcing students out of their dorms.  Students living in university housing will be instructed to “remain at, or return to, their permanent residences unless granted an exception by the institution,” according to a statement from the system.  The guidance from interim UNC System President Bill Roper is “to protect the health and safety of our campus communities during this unprecedented public health emergency.” Roper is the former dean of the UNC School of Medicine, CEO of UNC Health Care and director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  The schools are working on arrangements for employees to work remotely, granting certain paid administrative leave and identifying “mandatory employees needed for continued operations during the COVD-19 pandemic,” according to the system.  There was no timeline announced for these changes, but that information is likely to differ from campus to campus.  The UNC System previously instructed the institutions to transition from in-person instruction to online or remote classes during the spring semester. The hundreds of thousands of students and faculty at campuses in Chapel Hill, Charlotte, Boone, Wilmington, Greenville and others had an extra week of spring break to prepare for the new reality, which begins on Monday, March 23.
If anyone wants a pallet of toilet paper or water, I can get you a good price on it ;)  Edit: Yall are salty as all get out. I literally sell these things in pallet quantities to manufacturers.
It also allows NC to get access to medical supplies and prevent price gouging. A very good thing.
People over 65 *and people with heart or lung conditions or who are immunosuppressed.* There are a lot of younger people in that last category.
Subject to change and possibly ignored. I seen CDC papers that suggest people should avoid work if they are feeling sick but they have that part covered up.
Prepare how?
It's down to the states again sadly as our governing bodies in Washington are being stupid and lying about it. The whole country should have been taking steps way before rather than waiting. I am happy to ewe our state not taking this lightly at all so far.
I run a fairly large summer camp and I’ve seen registrations come to a halt. Just today, I’ve gotten 5 requests from parents for refunds, citing they are “moving,” or “now traveling” the week the originally booked. Coincidental or not, public perception of the incident will govern folks behavior from now until the outbreak of the virus is contained. We are in for a ride.
I mean, that should've happened already.  instead my kid's been in daycare for a week with a biogen kid, and i'm expecting my house has it right now  fuck  on the bright side, nbd for the kids, it's a weak cold. She had worse from a head cold two weeks ago.  guess I can sell my toiletpaper now
My wife works in the furniture industry and it sounds like they’re pushing hard not to cancel the event. Their precaution? Adding extra medical staff to the site... ridiculous.
No major sports events have been cancelled yet, but I imagine we're about a week away from a bunch of things happening...including NCAA tournament games banning in-person spectators. ACC Tournament might sneak under the rope...
Private schools in NC are encouraged to send their out of state students back to New Jersey to prevent further outbreaks during the ACC tournament.
Also the Wells Fargo PGA championship next month. It’s smaller, but still about 40,000 people, and probably a substantial percentage of them age 50+.
Why dollars of course! Did you forget where you live?
Bunch of old people I figure
The last tweet says, "I’m a PhD biologist but *not* an epidemiologist."  She studies genetic microbiology, but she's not a health expert or medical professional.
A former top CDC official just stated that he thinks that hospitals will be at capacity within 10 days.
To be fair, local hospitals have been running at capacity+ for months now. We’re making plans of what to do if stuff really goes down, but being at or above max census is nothing new in this area.
Fuck, I have a baby daughter due that week.
Here's the press release:  https://governor.nc.gov/news/governor-cooper-declares-state-emergency-respond-coronavirus-covid-19
I didn't get it.
I noticed this last week too. Gotta make money one way or another, I guess?
Those are confirmed. Unfortunately there are probably untold numbers of sick people walking around that we dont know about. Hard to confirm new cases when youndont test anyone.
7 confirmed. There are 3 marines at camp lejeune quarantined due to just returning from Italy.
The issue in the US is the lack of testing. Once they start doing it more, expect the number to jump sharply. Or maybe it is liberal fake news, who’s to say?
I get that it’s a joke, but people are scared and price gouging is an awful practice that is all too common in situations like this.  It’s not people being “salty as all get out,” you made a shitty joke at a bad time.  Own it.
Maybe we should just have a state of emergency all the time if it's so good.  /s
>  prevent price gouging. A very good thing.  If you like shortages.
>I seen CDC papers that suggest people should avoid work if they are feeling sick  Every news channel I've watched has stated that staying home if you feel sick is a suggested course of action.

As always: Bread and milk.  Now just get it for like 2 months.  Ignore the fact that the bread will be moldy after a week and the milk a creamy consistency by the end of the month... BREAD AND MILK.  &#x200B;  Though on a serious note: Things that you eat that have a long shelf life.  Good examples would be anything canned (tomatoes, peas, corn, spam, chicken, soup.)  Also you can get non-refrigerated pasta as that will stay good for around 1-2 years.  Rice and beans are always a good staple too.  Make sure you have enough oil for frying (if you do that.)  Parm in a shaker is good to have if you use that.  If you have pets, stock up on food for them too!  If you're unable to leave the house you need to feed them too!  &#x200B;  On the non-food side you probably want to just have enough to run your house for a month or two so you can reduce the need to go out.  Just general cleaning supplies to keep your house however clean you normally do, fabric softener and detergent, toilet paper (but jesus fuck dont hoard it) etc.  &#x200B;  Essentially this is **not** a "holy fuck the world is ending PREPARE FOR THE END OF TIMES" preparation.  It's just a "Prepare to try to avoid other motherfuckers for as long as possible" type.  If you can survive in your house for a month?  You're good.
The main thing I have heard from the news is to have a plan for childcare if schools close but you need to work.
> our governing bodies in Washington are being stupid and lying about it  It's mostly just one particular governing body in Washington lying about it
I mean, you could have decided to pull them a week ago.  The day care doesn't have to choose to close for you to not send your kid.
Why didn't you keep the kid home on your own?
What a terrible idea! Exposing extra medical staff unnecessarily 🤨
You must mean that ‘ambulance’ they are going to have on site. I laughed when I heard they announced that in the news yesterday. I thought there was always one parked downtown for Market. That just sounded like a PR stunt for the news.
*golfclap
Gotta keep those shareholders happy and someone at the top needs a third mega mansion.
Ha ha, of course not. How could I forget.  [The High Point furniture market has immense economic value for the region and the whole state. ](https://hpenews.com/news/14402/governor-no-intent-to-cancel-high-point-market/)
I'd be extremely happy if she were wrong. Unfortunately Italy and the situation in Iran fall right in line.
This is what people arent grasping. It isnt that this virus will necessarily kill you right away. For around 20% of those infected they will be made horribly ill by chronic pneumonia.   The US health system has X number of ICU beds, even less oxygenation machines. When you have 5 times the number of sick that are in need of critical care....and a limited number of machines and beds....you get what Italy is experiencing. A health system absolutely overrun and overwhelmed.   Right now the Italians are having to Triage patients and make some hard decisions. If you are over 60, sorry. Oh you are a smoker? Sorry. Got diabetes? You get to die. They are forced to treat the healthiest and most likely candidate to survive.   Italy is already operating at 200% capacity. They dont have enough N95 masks so many health care workers are working round the clock and are they themselves infected with the virus. The ones who are  testing positive but still able to work are asked to do so.  And the first case of the virus in Italy was only found about 2 or 3 weeks ago. They are barely getting started. This is a glimpse of what the US is about to be facing.
Won't affect maternity beds
Thanks. I have been trying to keep up.  There are probably others that we don't know if she to testing.
Nowhere did I imply that I would price gouge. I sell these things for a living in large quantities.
Actually, I think we are in a state of emergency more often then not.
What's the difference? Either you have shortages of toilet paper with price gouging protection, or it's going for $100/roll. That means only the wealthy get TP, so it's the same as a shortage for everyone else.
If I have to self quarantine , my plan is to buy a PS4 and a bunch of games. I have a freezer full of meat that I can try recipes on my smoker, and pretty much a months worth of everything.   Except beer.
>If you can survive in your house for a month?  You're good.  This discounts a ton of people in the eastern part of the state that get stir crazy and just have to get out and about no matter what.
but your job has to be cool with missing work, or bringing in a kid.  you also have to be cool without pay.
This was 11 days ago. I wouldnt be surprised if it is cancelled.
I'm not saying she's right or wrong.  I'm saying *you* are wrong.  You said:  > This was written by a well renowned epidemiologist so not some speculation.  It quite literally was *not* written by an epidemiologist.
I agree. I agree with everything you’ve said. I don’t know how to get people to understand these concepts. Personally, I feel the reason that people are not understanding is some combination of normalcy bias, alert fatigue, and the fact that our administration is completely inept and bungling their response while offering empty platitudes of reassurance. After watching the North Carolina press conference today it’s difficult to fill much reassurance with respect to the state’s handling of it, either. It’s difficult to feel so helpless.
Viral pneumonia was what killed in  the Great Flu Epidemic of 1918-1919. The huge difference is that it killed very healthy people in the prime of their lives because their strong immune systems over reacted.
No we aren't.
There's a middle ground you're purposefully ignoring. Higher prices gives an incentive to only purchases what you need and not horde. $100/roll is excessive and would lead to only the wealthy having TP, but don't act like increasing prices in accord with the laws of supply/demand is inherently a bad thing.
sounds like you don't have a keg fridge.
It is survive, not enjoy...
Would you mind re-reading the exchange above and your comment and thinking about whether it really makes sense?  I'm not trying to be a dick, I'm just genuinely not sure why you're saying this in reply to my comment.  I understand what you're saying/getting at, but it's really not that relevant to what I said.  My statement was not made in isolation.  It has very specific context.  That context is that somebody said "*that* should have happened already" where "that" is day cares suspending operation.  So that person was saying "day cares should have suspended operations already".  And that person went on to complain about their kid being in the day care throughout the past week.  My statement has nothing to do with what you're getting at.  It has to do with a very specific person making a complaint about something that they were in complete control of themselves.  It's like complaining about a restaurant not being closed when all s/he has to do is just not go eat at the restaurant.  Know what I mean?   If they're making that complaint, I'm presuming they're okay with the idea of the kid not being in the day care during that week they're saying the day care should have been closed (complaining about the kid being in day care means you wouldn't be complaining about them NOT being in daycare, right?  I mean, it would be an absurdly illogical comment for them to make otherwise).  Either you wish the day care would have closed last week or you're not happy with the idea of it closing against your control and causing you to miss work/hire a sitter/whatever.  Can't have that both ways, so I presume they're not thinking of it as being an issue for THEM specifically on that front.  Again, I totally understand the stresses that closing schools/day cares will put on people in general, and the economy in turn.  But this has nothing to do with that.
Noted and changed
I hear ya. I never in my lifetime imagined something like this would happen. You hear about it and read about it and pandemics are played out in films. But sitting here actually facing something like this is surreal. The helpless feeling is indeed the worst part.  Hang in there.
There are lots of reports out of Wuhan China about people overcoming the virus, then around 2 weeks later dropping dead out of nowhere. This is what it is being attribited to -   A cytokine storm is an overproduction of immune cells and their activating compounds (cytokines), which, in a flu infection, is often associated with a surge of activated immune cells into the lungs.Feb   Basically their immune system gets a false reading that a doomsday virus is attacking the body...and in turn releases a scorch the Earth response....shutting down lungs and killing the person dead.  Fun stuff

Lol are you really defending price gouging? The fucking weird shit some people say dude.
True, but after seeing people leave home just to ride around in the middle of the worst part of a hurricane I have no doubt they'll do the same with this if it gets to that point.
That’s exactly what happened in the 1918/1919 flu epidemic. What’s interesting is that it sounds ( I don’t know if true) that the immune vulnerable and elderly people with underlying conditions are the ones most likely to far poorly. Thing is these people don’t have immune responses capable of going into hyperdrive.   I do remember reading about people that looked and acted fine in the morning and we’re dead by nightfall. Definitely the scorched earth.  When it returned in 1919 the cases were much milder. The book read ( highly recommend) was  The Great Influenza by John M. Berry.
There's a difference between price gouging and supply and demand. You're being dense. Prices going up under high demand is a natural and healthy part of economics. Life is going to be tough for you if you can't understand that simple fact. For real, dude.  Am I defending obvious price gouging like you're insane $100 a roll for TP situation you immediately jumped to? Obviously not. I was simply saying that you taking raising prices under extreme demand as an inherently bad thing is a gross over simplification.
I get what you’re saying, but maybe economic security and consistent profits for corporations really aren’t fucking important during a real state of emergency. Like, if my options are everybody getting the supplies they need AND a company has a poor quarter, I’m fine with that. A company having record profits for a quarter that were built off of corrupt price gouging leading to the deaths of people who can’t afford it, I’m not fine with.   There is a middle ground but if I *have* to pick an extreme (halting price increases vs. price gouging) I know exactly which one I’m picking.
Sure, we agree on the better of the two extremes. And so does everyone else. Price gouging is wrong, but raising prices, to a certain extent, isn't wrong but in fact a good thing for everyone.  My entire point is that raising prices during high demand actually helps people get the supplies they NEED by pricing out other people's WANT. Yes it absolutely sucks to have to pay $15 for a pack of toilet paper, but it sure beats an empty shelf if you need toilet paper. If you've got a half pack at home, you aren't paying $15. Which leaves it for the next person who does need it.   Can this be taken to far? Absolutely. That's why price gouging laws exist. But without raising prices, there is no way to limit demand to those who are the most needy for the item. It sucks they have to pay more sure, but it's the only way the market has to regulate demand to the most needy.  This also ignores the benefit it does have for the store. I'm sure I won't find a receptive audience here, but in a time of true shortage where resupply may not happen for extended periods of time, the extra money made on the last of the supplies will be used to insure that the store owner has enough to pay the rent to keep so he can reopen the store later. Not so much an issue with large corporations, but critical for smaller family owned stores.  It's telling though that this sub will downvote Economics 101 level concepts.
> But without raising prices, there is no way to limit demand to those who are the most needy for the item  A "Limit 1 [or whatever #] per customer" sign does the trick
Not exactly. That limits it to the first come first serve basis and it's highly unlikely the first are also the most needy. People can't be counted on in times of crises to only buy want the truly need. When you're scared, wants seem a lot like needs.  I'm not saying fuck poor people and the only thing that matters is corporate profits. But there are GOOD market reasons for increasing prices during shortages. Within reason, it actually benefits everyone. If you're actually interested there are lots of good resources on YouTube and Khan for supply/demand economics.

Duke moves on-campus classes online, to prevent coronavirus

Yea I’m thinking the other major colleges are next
Fingers crossed that WFH is right around the corner.
https://coronavirus.duke.edu/2020/03/10/community-update-changes-to-spring-break-and-classes-new-travel-restrictions/
Thanks for sharing. I’m in the Triangle and I somehow did not think about how much of a danger Spring Break was.
NC public schools needs to act now.
I've heard rumors about it happening in my school.
And people were stoked about getting cheap airline tickets for spring break so possibly even more students traveled this spring break. People were justifying it because they were traveling to places where there are no known cases, but that is a function of testing (eg as of yesterday NC had only 150 tests in a state with 11 million people) so as more tests are available in the coming weeks the # on confirmed cases across the US is going to skyrocket
Word on the street is they will be this week. UNC should be announcing it today.
Where do you go if you don’t mind me asking?
Ehh I go to Duke and while this might also be true, a lot of people I know were specifically not traveling because of the outbreak. Not everyone was being very cautious to be sure but I wouldn't necessarily say that more people traveled than usual
Unc charlotte said they are holding a meeting today to discuss this so we will see
I heard this as well. We should hear something from the public school system this week.
I'm not sure I can share, since I have a bit of a better understanding than most students thanks to a student-worker position I'm in. though there should be official guidance tomorrow, and I know most of the faculty want a decision before next week when spring break ends.
Ok no problem! Thanks for sharing. Interested in the new news for tomorrow.

2 cases of Coronavirus at Cape Fear Valley Hospital(Fayetteville, NC)
I know from a member of the hospital’s board that there are at least two people with confirmed cases. Stay safe everyone.
When we're they found? This seems like scuttlebutt, not to be offensive, but I don't think they would be able to test it and get those results without others knowing because the tests are so hard to come by.  Edit: However, this makes it seem like they are indeed waiting to reveal a diagosis Soon  https://www.fayobserver.com/news/20200310/cumberland-county-outlines-coronavirus-notification-procedure
RemindMe! 10 days
I work at cape fear and have heard only rumors that were proven wrong. Cape fear would not try to hide or cover up having a corona virus outbreak and the nurses would shout it everywhere really quick. Cape fear as a whole has denied any cases and I have yet to see any myself.
This was bullshit at the time of writing, btw.
It’s probably smart as people are freaking out over something that is not that big of a deal
I found out today through the board member, but I am not sure how long they have known. I totally understand that it seems unlikely that the hospital could keep something like this contained, but it can happen.

It’s definitely good to not panic, but it’s also good to inform the public so that everyone can be safe, especially those at a higher risk.
Not a big deal huh? Wow.
Tell that to the family members of the people that have died from this virus. It has a higher mortality rate than the flu. Your mentality is going to get more people killed, so shut your mouth and wash your hands.
If you knew what is about to happen you would dig a fucking hole and hide in it.
Well hopefully they had limited contact in the community . Do you happen to known if the patient caught it travelling or community
When or if the CDC validates state labs’ “presumptive positive” results nationally, confirmed + results are disclosed. For individuals being tested and their communities, neither false positives nor false negatives are beneficial.
Agreed.  But panic helps no one and the reality is, the mortality is somewhat low compared to the everyday things we do (drive, consume fatty foods, etc)
Ok so be quiet and wash my hands.  Notice no panic there.
How are you on reddit from the hold you’ve already dug?

Coronavirus - why you should take this seriously starting right now
Some people are asking what's the big deal over coronavirus in NC when there are "only" seven confirmed cases.Three reasons:1. There are almost certainly more than seven actual cases. The truth is we are under-testing due to a national shortage of test kits (more on this later).2. Nationally, the number of infected people appears to be doubling roughly every week. That means we have exponential growth, which is difficult to conceptualize but basically means it starts off slow but then rapidly grows. It means we could go from 100 cases to 1,600,000 in roughly 14 weeks - absent successful containment.3. We don't have a vaccine (it's at least a year away) and - since we've never been exposed to this virus before - no one has any immunity built up.We should know relatively soon whether this will be contained. If it isn't, then the focus is going to be on slowing the rate of infection so our hospitals don't become overwhelmed. We do not want a situation like they have in northern Italy where this got completely out of hand in a matter of weeks and clogged all the hospitals.So we're washing our hands very often and refraining from handshakes and being otherwise sensible not just to keep ourselves healthy, but also to help slow the overall rate of infection to make sure hospitals can treat everyone who needs it.Part of my job is making sure you have reliable information as this situation develops, so when I learn new things from DHHS I will update you.Talk soon,Sen. Jeff Jackson

The problem is my employer is still requiring me and my colleagues to go into the office despite the fact that we can - and have during storms etc - successfully work from home. We already have work-issued laptops. I can limit my exposure by not going out as much as possible in my personal life but if I am stuck in cramped office space with hundreds of others for 40+ hours a week, it is pointless.  What can we do about Triangle employers who refuse to follow the governor’s directive “to telework to the greatest extent possible”?
Even if you think you are a relatively healthy person who will get over it in a couple of weeks please think of those who are not so fortunate such as the elderly. You can go for up to 2 weeks without showing symptoms and the disease spreads quickly.
Hey u/JeffJacksonNC thanks for all the updates!  I was thinking today that if there are emergency bills getting passed it would be great if you can add an amendment to have absentee ballots for 2020 Elections automatically sent to all registered voters.   It would help prevent spread in the fall when illnesses pick back up again, and would prevent any shenanigans like trying to cancel elections due to outbreaks.   There’s no reason we shouldn’t make it easy for people to vote from home. Always, but especially given the current crisis.   Thanks!  edit: u/glASS_BALLS pointed out that everyone can request an absentee balot to be sent to their home for any or no reason right now: https://www.ncvoter.org/absentee-ballots/ Great idea!
Any thoughts on the CDC suppressing testing while we denied the WHO test kits to make more money for private companies?
Stay safe ya'll. Watch out for the people on this sub trying to downplay this. Stay informed and remain vigilant!
Thank you so much for this information, senator. It really calming to hear that at least a few of our representatives in nc are actually trying to help people.
I work in human medical trials in wake county. We are testing  EVERY patient that has a scheduled appointment. We are doing this because the cdc is pretty certain that way more people than we currently know of have been exposed. We will be screening hundreds of people a day. Our entire med staff has already undergone training. The cdc is serious. You have no idea if you have been exposed. Even if all you have done since January was go to the taco bell drive thru, you may have been exposed and could spread it to other people. You may be healthy enough to beat it but the elderly person you helped cross the street may not be. Dont touch people. Dont touch your face. Don't touch a damn thing that you can avoid touching. If you go to church, decline communion. Jesus won't be mad. If you go to the gym, wipe down your equipment. At work, do not shake hands with people. At the store, use a pen to input your pin at check out. After washing your hands, use the paper towel to open the door and throw it out later.  Thanks for coming to my ted rant.
This is not like the flu people, it's a strain(CoVid 19) of the Corona virus that is more lethal than the flu, even thought most of the cases are mild and will be mild, you still have a 2 to 3% of fatality rate, this is huge, would you go in a room with 99 other persons where 2 or 3 of you won't come out alive?  Don't panic (buying toilet paper is not the solution), face masks won't help you and are more needed at hospitals than your house.  Protect your elderly as they're the most vulnerable, if you have a respiratory condition, be more careful than ever  And finally, don't listen to the moron we have as President, this won't away magically, listen to REAL professionals and your doctors, they know what they're talking about, not like the other guy that thinks he's a genius because his uncle went to MIT.  Be safe everyone
Is this what coherent government sounds like?
Senator:  Are there any conditions that must be met before the Governor or Legislature request action be taken to close the schools? Or are you leaving this up to each county?   Schools are likely to be a huge transmission vector. While it's true that thus far children seem to get only mild symptoms, they will spread it to their teacher, who will spread it to other teachers and then other students. Each kid that comes home with the illness can spread it to their Dad with diabetes, their mom with high blood pressure, or their grandparents who may have other comorbidities.   Is there any discussion on this issue? If just 20% of my county's 20,000 school employees (ie 4,000 people) get the illness it could overrun the entire county's medical system.
Thank you, Senator.  Yes, there are more than 7 cases.  At leat 4 in Johnston County have gone untested, according to my sister-in-law, an ER doctor.
/u/JeffJacksonNC - I've got an upcoming business trip to Raleigh next week to kickoff a large project. It will be my first face to face meeting with the client. The customer is willing to do this session remotely. I'm reluctant because, while doable, it would be outside the norm.  Still, I'd rather not be the vector up here in the mountains (though likely the students on Spring Break or tourists will bring it here anyway).  As someone who is uniquely involved in monitoring and coordinating the effort for NC, what's your recommendation?
I'm very ill informed but I've read somewhere that a vaccine won't be ready for the public for like 12-15 months. Is there really a possibility everyone won't get it? It seems kind of impossible to me. Like I get the point of slowing it down but it all seems kind of worthless to me. Also, being from the USA with no insurance, for the people that are getting through the virus do they need medical intervention to get through it or is it something you can just stay home with and eventually you will get over it?
I asked HR if CV will be covered under Short Term disabilty, they said yes.     Just have to find a medical department that has a testing kit, pay $3,500 for the test, then hope my insurer doesn't fire me during the "eradication" phase
My mother works at the Smithfield foods plant in Tarheel. Should I be concerned?
Nine North Carolinians now.
I just came back from a trio to England on Monday. Should I be worried that I could spread the virus even though I’m not sure I have it and have no symptoms? I’m young and healthy so from what I understand it’s possible that I wouldn’t get any symptoms if I have it. Is there any way to get tested without a massive bill?
I was scared that I was going to get it, since the first cases in Duke and ECU came around the same time, and the students had been to Italy. I was at ECU all day for ACC when the students had tested positive, and we heard that some students came to our concert.
I am getting married 3/28 and set to head off to Barbados for honeymoon 3/29. Should I be concerned?
I've got a planned trip to Pinehurst for March 19-22. Is it safe to come?
Any plans on suspending visitations at Prison facilities?

Is it just me or does this feel like the highsnobiety disease here in the West? Think about who is getting it primarily outside of China.  * People that go to fancy conferences * People that go on cruise * Government officials * People Jet setting around the globe. I went to Italy too see my hair stylist. * Tom Hanks has it.    * NBA players got it    Stay away from these folks.
The swine flu (H1N1, 2009) killed 5x more people globally than what have already been by Covid-19. I’m still struggling to figure out why we are panicking so much today compared to how people were then; for the most part everything turned out okay
I’m confused and need some help understanding this flu version. And that’s what this is. A flu. Like many flus we don’t have a vaccine for them all. Each year the flu kills between 8000-25000 in the states alone. Like the flu it hurts the young and old.   So if it is a flu for which we do not have a vaccine for—why do these versions get so much more blown out of proportion? Or inversely why don’t we take all flus that kill so many each year more seriously?
I'm still not really scared of it
Nah.
This. So much this. And to do this we need to close public schools soon. Duke has already suspended classes. UNC to make a decision today. WCPSS needs to make a call.
Came here to link this.  Wish everyone knew it.
This is excellent, thank you!
Looks like it's been hugged.
Governor: "allow employees to work from home when possible"  Wake County government: "lol, nah"  I totally understand your frustration
Cough into the faces of all your management
Keep your foot on their necks  Send out large clear e.ails about concerns.  Ask what the plan of action is if someone show symptoms in a cubicle at work   Apply pressure
Employers are dumb
This is what amazes me that so few mention in the news.   They need to blatantly say, "look, we all know you're invincible, but the little old lady you walk by or the old man that opened the door after you will probably be dead in a week because of your fucking ignorance"
Not only that, for healthy people in their 20s, COVID-19 still has double the mortality rate as the seasonal flu. Its still pretty low, but just because you’re 25 doesn’t make you invincible
exactly!
OR give it to young people who are immunocompromised or with lung or heart disease who don’t stand a chance against this thing. The inconsiderate, uncaring and blasé attitude of these “I’m young and healthy, nothing will happen to me” people is breathtaking.
Disinfect BEFORE and AFTER. But do it before for the sake of those you come into contact with. Do it after for yourself.
I just requested one for myself and my wife.
This would be way easier said than done. We're not set up to be a mail-in only voting state like WA. The first major problem is a person's registration address might not match their mailing address (because there is currently no reason for it to need to). The second is a concern of forgery/fraud. We can't just mail out 7 million ballots to people who haven't requested them or confirmed their identity. Someone could fraudulently fill out your ballot, mail it in, and you wouldn't find out until you go to the poll on election day that someone has already voted for you.   Again, it's a nice thought, but there is no way something like that could be done by a simple emergency bill amendment. We'd need *substantial* changes to our voting system, and that ain't happening in 6 months.
You believe this will continue come November?
I'm 99% sure I had H1N1 during the height of that pandemic. Long story short, I stupidly took a vacation in a hot zone, got food poisoning (thus weak immune system) and came back home with a bad respiratory flu that lasted a month and a half and spawned multiple secondary infections before it was done with me. No one even mentioned a swine flu test, thus the 1% doubt that I actually had it. Obama didn't send me a get well card, but then I didn't expect him to cure me.  Some perspective, not that it will alleviate the panic for those who are determined.
Get people killed? It's hard to find any decent reason not to save lives at this critical point in the spread.
Do you have a source for that?  Haven't seen anything about that.  Edit:  lol, why would somebody downvote this question?
> Watch out for the people ~~on this sub~~ trying to downplay this.   FTFY. Saw people on different subs and FB doing this.
Are you screening (asking questions about symptoms/travel) or actually testing (naso/oropharyngeal swabs)?
The mortality rate isn’t actually known since its likely so few cases are being tested. A lot of estimates put it around .5%. Still higher than the flu, but curves up significantly with older or infirmed patients.   The real scare is the rate of serious infection needing intensive care and our medical infrastructure not being able to handle it.
I can't believe how many times I've seen this figure glossed over...even by pundits and politicians on TV. "Most of you will survive" is the shittiest sentiment.   We rearranged our entire society and government, spent $6,000,000,000,000, killed 100s of thousands, lost thousands more soldiers and added three new law enforcement depts when 3000 Americans died on 9/11.    Terrorism deaths are less likely than lightning strike deaths....   Now we have a real threat, if totally unmanaged will cause the deaths of at least 3,000,000 Americans in the next year....and high profile people say "most" of us will survive... It's just crazy.  edit: I maintain the central point...this is more serious than 9/11 as regards loss of life. It's true, I'm spooked. I'm worried about a politicized CDC that has prevented testing and is under-reporting total cases and not in a timely manner. They are taking weekends off... sorry that's goofy to this layman.   I'm about to attend a funeral at Arlington National Cemetery where hand shaking is now forbidden. We have 3 people in our party in the upper 80s and one in the 90s and many many others over 60... Doctors and caregivers have advised all of those not to attend. That advisement is presumably based on the over 10% mortality for the elderly. My own presumed fatality rate as a 50 year old is over 1% AT LEAST. Should I attend? Just because my mortality is 10x lower than someone in their 80s. Still seems like a crazy risk. BUT especially at this early moment when we still don't know so many crucial pieces of data. "Better safe than sorry" is fair right now I argue. I'm waiting for more confident answers from scientists. Until then I'm following the advice that privileged people are taking everywhere in the US...no large groups, no non-essential travel, work at home if possible.  edit 2: Hey ya know... if the good ole' flu is killing 30,000 a year ... yeah, let's fix that too.... 6 trillion bucks goes a long way....
>would you go in a room with 99 other persons where 2 or 3 of you won't come out alive?  It's problematic to apply this blanket statistic in such a manner. The Case Fatality Rate (CFR) is less than .5% for nearly everyone under 50. It skyrockets massively above 50 with a CFR of around 15% for people 80 and older. The CFR is 50% for people who are already critically ill.  The point people should be getting is that if they're under 50 and infected with the virus, they're likely to be fine. The real threat is re-transmission to the elderly. Don't wash your hands to save yourself from a fever with a cough, wash your hands to save your parent's lives.
> you still have a 2 to 3% of fatality rate, this is huge, would you go in a room with 99 other persons where 2 or 3 of you won't come out alive?  This is not true. We don't know the full number of cases, so we do not know the mortality rate. You can't calculate the rate of mortality when we don't know the total number of people infected, and you can't have a good estimate of the number of people infected until the disease has been prominent for a good amount of time.  I keep seeing people screaming that we aren't doing enough testing, so there are more infected than confirmed cases (probably true), and in the same breath citing a 3-4% mortality rate among known cases. If you'd stop and think for a second, you'd realize a substantial amount of additional confirmed cases of people just living their daily lives would also mean a substantial reduction in the mortality rate of the disease. So, please stop propagating irrational fear by spreading false/misleading information. This doesn't help anyone.
also worth noting “mild” symptoms range up to and including PNEUMONIA. basically the way the cases are being categorized is, if you don’t need oxygen or other emergency assistance, it’s “mild”.
Except to generalize it down to ANYONE having a 2-3% mortality rate is ridiculous when numbers like that are heavily skewed by high-risk individuals (the elderly, very young children, and immunodeficient individuals). A healthy person who isn’t elderly or has underlying health issues relating to this would almost certainly be fine.
Complete false information.  It is not a 2 to 3 percent mortality rate.    Go read actual facts and ignore this crap being spread.
I'm obviously not the senator, but I'd recommend doing it remotely and emphasizing to your client that the decision is being made for their safety as well as yours. Perhaps float a future in-person meeting for after the pandemic has subsided.  Mostly, though, I wanted to take a moment to seize on this bit:  > likely the students on Spring Break or tourists will bring it here anyway  Tourists, quite possibly, but the state university system is taking measures to try and ensure that its campuses and returning students aren't a transmission vector:  https://www.appstate.edu/go/coronavirus/updates/ https://healthandcounseling.unca.edu/covid-19/ https://www.wcu.edu/coronavirus/index.aspx
It’s really just dependent on the person. Form what I’ve seen, and please correct me if I’m wrong someone, it’s not the virus that’s so bad as much as the secondary infections it causes. Pneumonia being the main one. You might have cold like symptoms and be fine just nursing it at home and you might end up in the ICU on a ventilator. It just varies, but certain age groups (60+) and people with compromised immune symptoms are the most at risk, just like with our normal seasonal flu.    Don’t know much about the vaccine, other than it’s at least a year, year and a half, away and I’m sure the most at risk groups will be prioritized. I remember in the past there was an awful flu season and they rationed the flu vaccine for the people who needed it most till they got more, so that’s probably how they’ll start and then move out to other groups as more vaccines are manufactured if this turns into a seasonal occurrence.
yes, you should be worried, and no, you probably can’t get tested for love or money if you’re not showing symptoms. It would be a good idea to self-isolate for a couple of weeks if that’s at all possible for you. I know it’s not for many people tho. Just avoid touching people and wash hands obsessively, cover your face if you can, and if you can isolate until at least monday and you’re still not showing any symptoms, you’re probably in the clear, based on the incubation time.   even after that tho, EVERYONE should be limiting non-essential travel and face to face interactions, and practicing really stringent hygiene.
If you can postpone, that might be worth considering, given the travel limitations being floated the last day or so.
Cancel the ceremony. Cancel the reception. Cancel the honeymoon.   Wash your hands, go to the courthouse, wash your hands, get married, kiss your partner, wash your hands, go home.
I'd consider postponing that honeymoon. Worst case, you're infected and come down with symptoms while there, and now you've contaminated an island nation with nowhere else to go. Best case, the airline will jerk you around on flights with ever increasing delays, changes, and cancellations, until it's impossible to plan. Most airlines are offering postponement and/or refunds if you booked before a certain time (e.g. Delta, booked before March 1).  I know you probably have accommodation and maybe even activities planned as well. I'd get in contact with them about postponement too.  And I wouldn't be surprised to hear of countries starting to put Americans in quarantine upon entry to their country, starting today. We're at about 1000 cases now, and we're considered to have sustained community spread. Now, while that's only been confirmed in NY, WA, and CA, it's most likely true for anywhere it is now. Most notably near you, in GA. Probably in NC too.  What's your plan if Barbados starts denying entry to Americans?
I rest my case.  https://www.reddit.com/r/duke/comments/fi6r29/duke_grad_students_test_positive_for_covid19/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share
everything is still going to turn out ok eventually. nobody is really saying otherwise. What people are trying to tell you is that it's a very serious issue and precautions should be taken.
Because this is roughly 10x the fatality rate, we have no vaccine, and no one has any built-up immunity from prior exposure. If left unchecked, it will cause far more death than the yearly flu.
No, this isn’t about being scared, but knowledgeable.
you don't need to be personally scared to  take it seriously.
Good! This is still early days, so it's appropriate to just stay informed and try to set up a contingency plan in case things don't turn out as well as we're all hoping.
That is the spirit!
WCPSS did make a call. As of now, they are not closing schools.  There is going to be a lot of hesitation from the state to support closing schools at this point.  It would have a massive negative impact on the economy.  I'm not saying they should or shouldn't do it.  But there is a reason the statement from the governor yesterday very specifically said they weren't encouraging schools to close at this time.  And it's very much addressed indirectly in that link.  You take kids out of schools and now parents have to miss work.  They will exhaust what little leave they have, go unpaid, etc. because many workers don't have those benefits.  It will be a hit to the economy.  And maybe it's in the best interest long-term, but it's a very large pill to swallow.  So closing schools at that scale rather than just specific schools due to quarantine is a huge deal.  Totally different ball game for college students.  A) they'e adults who don't need a parent to miss work to care for them. B) learning in college is student oriented and intructor supported (a few hours of instruction for what should be more hours of studying for the student). K-12 is a lot of intructor contact.  So UNC, Duke, NCSU, etc is an apples and oranges comparison to k-12.
Hell, State Government: "We don't have a policy for that."  My wife has a coworker who is supposed to self-quarantine with his wife because she traveled internationally for a funeral and works with immunity compromised people. He asked to work from home or, if not, to use sick days. The bosses said be here for work or take vacation.
Ironically my manager works remote out of state. She “feels more comfortable with us being at the office.”
"Accidentally" send to company-wide listserv. (TIL it's not 'list serve')
This is why companies who hold conferences that unnecessarily spread this virus need to be held accountable.
And, what, we stop our lives for them? Start a panic, crash the economy? Do you do that every flu season? If not, does that mean you're fucking ignorant?
North Carolina already has "no excuse" absentee voting. Everyone should just do this. You don't need a reason you don't want to go to the polls. You just fill out the request form (link below) and mail to your county election office.  It's ridiculous that the state doesn't just have this set up for everyone like CA and WA, but we'll get there. The trick with this one is, if a GOP volunteer or paid staffer shows up at your door and offers to help you fill it out or deliver it for you....you say NO!  &#x200B;  [https://www.ncvoter.org/absentee-ballots/](https://www.ncvoter.org/absentee-ballots/)
1) Actually, the [voter registration form](https://dl.ncsbe.gov/Voter_Registration/NCVoterRegForm_06W.pdf) asks for BOTH your residential address AND your mailing address.  You also provide additional identity info when you register.  2) Voter fraud is essentially nonexistent, and is ALREADY a felony.  It would be ridiculous and absurd for people to engage in it for one vote.  The bigger concern is people like the republican operatives who did it on a big scale, but they would literally have to go door to door to collect them.    There is no legitimate reason to not mail ballots to each registered person, other than trying to make it harder for people to vote.
You believe it will no longer be of any concern by November?
While pandemics do indeed decrease during the summer, they do come back during the fall/winter. And with how easily this virus spreads, it could get worse after the summer.
You can read about it here: [https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/what-went-wrong-with-the-coronavirus-tests/2020/03/07/915f5dea-5d82-11ea-b29b-9db42f7803a7\_story.html](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/what-went-wrong-with-the-coronavirus-tests/2020/03/07/915f5dea-5d82-11ea-b29b-9db42f7803a7_story.html)      Since its behind a paywall here's the text:   *China developed its own test. Leading laboratories in Germany published their own version, which was adopted by the World Health Organization. Many countries, including the United States, developed their own tests.*  *The traditional U.S. strategy for devising new diagnostic tests starts with the CDC. That is supposed to ensure new tests are accurate and reliable, but it also meant that other parallel approaches were not aggressively pursued.*  *Scott Gottlieb, former Food and Drug Administration commissioner in the Trump administration, said, “The key in a crisis like this is to take an all-of-the-above approach, whether we’re dealing with diagnostics or therapeutics.” That responsibility, he said, was up to other parts of the administration, such as the Department of Health and Human Services or the FDA.*  *A week later, the United States declared a public health emergency, a process designed to speed the development of diagnostic tests and other medical products. The CDC received the first “emergency use authorization” to make and distribute its test to the backbone of the public health system in the United States — mostly state labs.*  *But the emergency policy, intended to keep quality high, also discouraged hospital labs from quickly developing in-house tests. They would need specific approval from the FDA to do so.*  *“Since CDC and FDA haven’t authorized public health or hospital labs to run the tests, right now #CDC is the only place that can. So, screening has to be rationed,” Gottlieb tweeted on Feb. 2.*  *The CDC manufactured kits, and on Feb. 6 and 7, 90 test kits were shipped to the public health labs. Some labs began to have trouble with the test. On Feb. 12, the CDC announced the test was providing inconclusive results in some laboratories. The problem was in one of the three components of the test.*  *It involved a part of the third component intended to be a backstop — a double-check so that when labs get a negative result, they can trust it. A federal official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because there is an ongoing investigation, said the problem may have been a design flaw or contamination in a CDC lab when the tests were being produced.*  *Some critics have questioned why the CDC didn’t switch to tests being used by other countries as soon as the problems arose, but the official said it would have taken longer to apply for a new authorization from the FDA and validate and manufacture a new test than it would to fix a test they knew worked in their own lab.*  *Demand for testing was manageable at the time — in part because the CDC criteria for who should get tested required recent travel to China or close contact with a confirmed case. That narrow testing identified few infections, reinforcing the idea that the country had enough tests.*  *But epidemiologists advising the CDC already had been debating when to begin broader testing to see if the virus was circulating in the community, said Jeffrey Engel, executive director of the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists. Narrow testing basically guaranteed that the United States would remain unaware of whether the virus was already circulating among people who thought they had a cold or the flu.*  *On Feb. 13, HHS Secretary Alex Azar testified before Congress that a limited five-city pilot would begin to add coronavirus to the usual flu surveillance system to see whether “there is broader spread than we have been able to detect so far.” But the plan was delayed because coronavirus tests weren’t available.*  *Academic hospitals, which have laboratories that routinely develop tests to use on their patients, began to get increasingly anxious about the nation being dependent on the CDC lab. They considered pursuing FDA approval for their tests but complained they didn’t have the resources or expertise — or access to crucial materials such as the virus itself — for the complicated application process required during a public health emergency.*  *“When the CDC test was delayed, then the cases started appearing outside of China, there should have been a quicker response to get diagnostic testing going” by easing regulations on hospital labs, said Melissa Miller, director of the clinical molecular microbiology laboratory at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Medicine.*  *During the Zika outbreak, some laboratories developed their own tests and got letters from the FDA notifying them that their tests had not been approved. Even as coronavirus testing remained limited nationwide, the CDC reminded hospitals on Feb. 18 that they shouldn’t do their own testing without an “emergency use authorization” from the FDA.*  *People experienced with working on other outbreaks have said that more flexibility was necessary to get more labs and companies testing.*  *“I don’t think anyone is used to dealing with a pandemic like this. None of us alive have ever witnessed a pandemic like this, or what it could become. I think traditional ways of looking at how to develop diagnostics, therapeutic . . . have to be thought of differently, or we’ll never get things out fast enough,” said Mark Miller, chief medical officer of bioMérieux, a leading diagnostics company that aims to launch a test by the end of March.*  *As days went by, public health labs became increasingly desperate and on Feb. 25 requested special permission from the FDA to develop their own tests. The agency accepted the request. But along with the CDC, it also found a workaround, allowing a partial CDC test to be used. New test kits began to be sent out in the following days, with two of the three original components.*  *Almost as soon as testing capabilities came online, labs found cases of coronavirus. A week ago, a person in Oregon who had been sick since Feb. 19 tested positive — hours after state officials got their CDC test up and running. In Washington state, one of the cases identified was a teenager who went to the doctor with ordinary flu symptoms; his swab was submitted through surveillance testing that was only possible after the testing capabilities came online.*  *On Feb. 29, the FDA finally announced a new policy to make it easier for hospital laboratories to develop their own tests. “This outbreak and our response is dynamic and evolving,” said Stephanie Caccomo, a spokeswoman for the FDA. “As the situation changes, we are being flexible as we execute policies intended to protect public health.”*  *“Most laboratories were anticipating a more rigorous FDA stance, and had not been leaning forward for tests that could have been made more useful,” a federal health official said. “We were working under the rubric and framework they set in place, and had they known things could be more flexible,” labs might have moved forward faster.*  *Public health labs had received tests for up to 75,000 people by Friday. As of Friday night, more than 1.1 million tests had been shipped to nonpublic health labs including academic medical centers and commercial laboratories, officials said. The administration said 4 million more tests will be shipped in the next several days.*  *Quest Diagnostics announced its coronavirus testing would be available Monday. LabCorp announced its tests were available Thursday evening.*  *As testing problems are fixed, public confusion remains — as does frustration about uneven access to testing.*
Here's a link to a NYTimes article. It mentions the question at hand in the section "We Can't Get Tested".  https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/02/health/coronavirus-testing-cdc.html?0p19G=2870  Sorry, you're getting downvotes for asking for sources.
I was at work so I couldn't source you(nor did I downvote you) but /u/prideofpomona did better than I could have.
Fair point.
We dont have enough swabs to test everyone unfortunately, but we screen people pretty loosely in that if they have essentially been outside too much or they have a headache we will test them or send them to the hospital next door to test. We should be getting more kits soon so we can test more people more thoroughly.
The joker really put it the best.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-gf29nuYYA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-gf29nuYYA)  9/11 wasn't planned.  This while also not planned immediately, was eventually planned in once we started hearing more about it.
> Now we have a real threat, if totally unmanaged will cause the deaths of at least 3,000,000 Americans in the next year.  Uh, where did you get that figure? Are you seriously suggesting that 1% of our entire population is going to die from this in the next year? Are you assuming literally every single American is going to be infected with it this year, or something?   This right here is part of the problem why many people aren't taking this disease seriously. People like yourself are making wildly inaccurate, doomsday predictions, so people just look at all precautions as equally ridiculous. You're crying wolf, doing more harm than good. Stop it.  Edit- Saying "TrUmp BaD!" doesn't make the claim of 3 million Americans dying from COVID-19 this year any less ridiculous, people. Cut the whataboutism. I'm not responsible for what Trump says. You are responsible for what YOU say.
Plus a large chunk of [our doctors are 50+](https://www.statista.com/statistics/415961/share-of-age-among-us-physicians/). Preventing spread helps protect our already stressed healthcare system. I assume a large part of the workforce is also in that age group but I don't understand the [labor stats from .gov](https://www.bls.gov/cps/cpsaat03.htm)
From watching Cspan this morning the mortality rate is more likely 1%. Still, ten times the mortality rate of flu.
According to the WHO it’s higher: 3-4%   https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200306-sitrep-46-covid-19.pdf?  Or is that “fake news”? 😂
Oh wow, that's interesting, from who do you get your information? Trump and his incompetent administration, because the WHO (World Health Organization) is setting the mortality rate around 3.4%, here is the [source](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-death-rate/#who-03-03-20), even in the US with the confirmed cases(700+) and the confirmed deaths(26), puts the rate around 4%, so, can you give us your credible sources? like the WHO
[https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/03/who-says-coronavirus-death-rate-is-3point4percent-globally-higher-than-previously-thought.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/03/who-says-coronavirus-death-rate-is-3point4percent-globally-higher-than-previously-thought.html)
If this is sarcasm, add the /s if it's not, you're wrong, the mortality rate of the flu is around 0.1%, that's around 1 death for every 1000 cases ([source](https://www.livescience.com/new-coronavirus-compare-with-flu.html) here) while if we use the current estimated rate from the WHO for CoVid-19, that's 3.4%, it means that 1 in every 30 cases will die ([source](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-death-rate/#who-03-03-20) here)
Do you have a reference for that? The current mortality rate for the flu is \~0.1%, for COVID-19 it's \~2-3%. That's roughly 20-30 times higher.
Built up immunity is a bit moot. Since we don’t have tolerance for most influenza strains, and no vaccines. Second point is better. The cfr rate is currently 3% vs .2% (seasonal flus.) Thats more helpful. It does ask a question of when do we care about fatality rates. 25k is not enough but 75k is?   Not trying to troll but it’s a good discussion to understand our logic a bit more.  edit: gg for the conversation Reddit. I bet you got all the tp too. Smh.
Of course not. I was implying that as a youth it would be easier to take the issue more seriously because I had a lack of fear toward the issue. The only thing I fear as of now is the well being of our senior citizens.
Agree. And I realize that closing public schools is a much, much harder decision.  Some kids get their meals at school, some kids get shelter at school, nurses have kids in schools etc. At the same time schools are probably our biggest vector for disease spread. Its like a large conference every day.   Flattening the curve suggests that taking 3-4 weeks off now will bring us all back to normal sooner. If we wait this will overwhelm our health facilities.   Entire countries are cancelling school for this reason. I believe Poland just announced the same. Perhaps we start off by making it voluntary.  Edit: Since I wrote this Belgium has cancelled all school. Seattle has cancelled public schools. UNC has moved all classes online.
Interesting, I've got a friend who works for the state, and he said he got a notification saying they're on voluntary work from home status. Maybe that varies by department
No because the flu statistically is less deadly and requires far less hospitalization. If 10-20% of corona virus patients need a breather our hospitals will collapse. We also have a vaccine for the flu so older people who take it are at less risk of complications. This is not the flu and should not be treated as such. Death rate is not what should be fixated on.  The economy will recover and everything will go back to normal eventually. At what cost should we try to maintain constant growth?
Get your flu vaccine. That's what you do for older people, younger kids, and the immunocompromised.
> It's ridiculous that the state doesn't just have this set up for everyone like CA and WA  Is everyone all of sudden forgetting that we had to redo an entire congressional election just last year **because of absentee voting** ?
Voter fraud may be essentially non existent. But election fraud isn’t. The most recent example being the 2018 election hoopla in Charlotte (NC 9th) with McRae Dowless  Edit: it wasn’t Charlotte. It was Rowan county
Correct. When Summer hits, cases will drop thanks to humidity and should be easier to contain the remaining infected.
Thanks for posting this!
Good read.  Thanks for the information.  Yeah, I don't really care about the downvotes so much the notion that somebody would downvote a question like that about such a claim. I mean, it's a pretty serious claim.  I've been getting a lot of my information from the CDC and WHO websites directly.  I know the media has been all over the place on it and just try to avoid it.  And this isn't the kind of thing that would be on those sites, so I just hadn't seen it.
That number might be high, but its not ridiculous. Chancellor Merkel just warned that they are expecting 2/3 of the German population to become infected before a vaccine is available - within this year. With our population of 327 million people, if 2/3 did become infected, with a 1% mortality rate we'd be looking at 2,180,000 deaths. Of course there are a lot of assumptions - it could be much worse if the hospitals are overwhelmed and it could be much better if we achieve some level of containment.
So let's cut in half. Say 1.5 million deaths. That's 50% of the population getting infected (a fairly low bar for a novel virus) and a 1% case fatality rate. That's an extremely reasonable possibility, and doesn't account for non COVID 19 deaths that are related to the overwhelmed healthcare system. The point still stands regarding the difference between 9/11 and this.
You may not like it, but some very important and much smarter than you people are worried,  *"The attending physician of Congress and the Supreme Court, Brian Monahan, briefed Senate staff on Tuesday afternoon in a closed-door meeting and said that he expects 70 million to 150 million people in the U.S. will contract the coronavirus, two sources tell NBC News. "*  Current world wide mortality rate is 3.5% which would be around 250,000 - 1.2 million people in the US alone.   So not quite drinking bleach panic time, but a potentially lot of people.   This isn't the flu and shouldn't be treated as such.   https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-death-rate/
No, people aren't taking it seriously because Trump told them not to.
Many people aren't taking this disease seriously because the leader of the free world is calling it a hoax. He's a senile narcissist, what's your excuse?
>  if totally unmanaged
1% is a hell of a lot for something as contagious as this seems to be. With any luck, it's not even that high, but even being optimistic, it's probably going to play hell with our healthcare system.
If we use 3.5% and it spreads throughout American that will be over 11 million dead in the US. Everyone will know someone who has died from it. I think US mortality will be more like 1% but even at 0.5% we will lose over a million people to this in the US.
It's inaccurate news based on testing of people who demonstrate symptoms. In South Korea where significantly greater numbers of people have been tested than just those showing symptoms they have a much lower mortality rate of around .6%  It's too early to draw any real conclusions, but you cannot argue to broader testing wont result in a more accurate number.  downvotes from people who failed stats class... for the most part all we have is a sample of people over representative of those who are showing moderate to severe symptoms.
yeah, i'm sure some people on social media think it's apocalyptic, but the health experts aren't saying that. but thousands could die and some hospitals could easily be overwhelmed.
Yeah, it's basically almost 200 small conferences happening every single day.  A schools is between say 600 and 2000ish students?  Some of the highs schools may be closer to 3000?  That is a lot of opportunity for things to spread.
It always comes down to money   Screw preventative measures in a pandemic...its all about not having the worker bees ar work  Frustrating
Here's a podcast from Harvard School of Education that discusses the many implications of closing public schools. https://soundcloud.com/harvardedcast/schools-families-and-the-coronavirus  With regards to WCPSS, my opinion is that they need to put in place a provision that allows elective absences for social distancing reasons. If I elect to follow suggestions to avoid crowds in an effort to help protect vulnerable family or even just vulnerable people in the community, then I should be allowed to withdraw my children for the remainder of the school year. Provisions can be made to make up standardized tests later in the summer.
You are correct, I exaggerated implying all of NC state government. I'm sure it varies. Which is insane. From what I understand this is not even the policy for the whole department, just their section of it.
No one yet knows what the true mortality rate is so stop pretending we do.  I'm all for a month's vacation, but most of us don't have that luxury.
Close. We had to redo a vote because of vote harvesting, which is illegal. It was also a long time (several election cycles) method of election fraud used by the NC GOP.   If everyone just requested an absentee ballot and mailed it in themselves, those shenanigans in the 9th would not have worked.
And it's terrible.  But the best way to combat it is to make it easier for more people to vote.  And to actively prosecute those responsible to discourage others from similar behavior.  And not to have republicans hire people like that to boost their numbers illegally.
> in Charlotte (NC 9th) with McRae Dowless  Wasn't in Charlotte.  It was on the exact opposite end of the district, in Bladen county (and maybe a little bit in Robeson)
No offense, but this sounds like a layman's opinion. Do you have any sources or evidence or is this just positive thinking?
Same thing happened with the Spanish flu, cases dropped off over summer then it came back way worse in November October
I think you're basing this on how the flu behaves, whuch isn't unreasonable.  But experts have stated that they don't know if covid-19 will die down as the weather changes like the flu does or not.  They just don't know.
SARS was just fine in the heat and humidity. This is much closer to SARS than the flu.  Also:  https://www.reddit.com/r/China_Flu/comments/fh0vft/qatar_has_a_very_hot_climate_and_are_currently
No problem. Its always good to have all the information. I'm no fan of the current administration, but also, I think that the testing was delayed more to regulatory capture of the FDA which predates Trump.   That being said, if we as a country had allowed aggressive testing and quarantine using the testing methods already in use by the WHO we could be looking at successful containment rather than accepting widespread infection. I think that a strong administration could have pressured from the top down to pull out all the stops, use the available testing methods, and had a chance at containment. Instead we got political spin and the FDA/pharmaceutical industry was left to its own devices.
His point about 9/11 is a fallacy. Disease and War are not the same thing. 61,000 Americans died from the 2018-19 seasonal flu. Hell, 280,000 Americans die from obesity related illnesses every year. Yet people aren't losing their shit like neanderthals over those statistics, spreading fake news everywhere.   And again (I feel like I have to keep stating this because alarmists are quick to jump on you if you don't clarify): This is a serious disease and we *should* be taking precautions. All I'm saying is that throwing out ridiculous, made-up numbers to try and scare people into agreeing with you is harmful.
This doesn't change the fact that claiming 3 million Americans will die from this is any less stupid.
Fake news. Quit repeating everything MSNBC blares at you.
That's not a source, nor is it any less ridiculous of a statement because we *are* managing it (though I agree we could be doing much better).
I would only point out that, even given your numbers, and given a health care system that is not overwhelmed and is not having  to triage ventilators and beds.....0.6% is still 6-fold higher than a bad flu year.
And these kids are in close quarters all day making matters even worse.
My my my.... the consequences of having no security net in our society.  It will just kill off the weak so capitalism can continue to roll along /s
Yeah, it's ridiculous that governments are preaching for people/employers to do what they are refusing to do themselves
So youre all for our hospitals being overrun? Italy only has a little over 10k cases and they're out of beds.
> We had to redo a vote because of vote harvesting, which is illegal  Yeah...vote harvesting of **Absentee ballots**  >It was also a long time (several election cycles) method of election fraud used by the NC GOP  The guy they busted was a long time operative of the NC democrat party...he switch to GOP only in the last couple of elections.  >If everyone just requested an absentee ballot and mailed it in themselves, those shenanigans in the 9th would not have worked.  Sure...because what could possibly go wrong /s
Agree totally. Voting should be the easiest thing to do with virtually zero hurdles. I hope one day we get there
My mistake! Thanks for the correction
It might happen, positive thinking, CoVid-19 is at the end a strain of the Corona virus, the problem is not that, the problem is that come Fall/Winter and the cases will come back, because they will, and we'll still not be ready, there'll still be no vaccine, closer to one, but not there yet.  So if this positive thinking happens, the government and hospitals should use those months to contain whatever cases left, produce enough testing kits, procedures, etc, so when the first cases start showing up again, we will be ready and not go into panic like we are.  BTW, selling toilet paper, $2,000 dollars for 6 rolls, send me a DM :)
Here's a link: https://www.livescience.com/27533-flu-transmission-humidity.html
Qatar just reported 230+ new cases today, and it is quite warm there ATM
This is not SARS.
It's the difference between a 2% CFR and a 1% CFR if half the population gets infected, so I'm not sure "made up" or "ridiculous" are appropriate descriptors. Are they leaning towards the worst case scenario end? Sure, but they're not so improbable as to be ridiculous.   I also don't think comparing an infectious disease to obesity is any better than comparing it to 9/11. Obesity is a chronic condition that isn't contagious (in the traditional sense of the word), and doesn't need immediate, drastic action taken to prevent it from potentially completely overwhelming the healthcare system.   I'm glad you understand it's serious, and I agree that there are some people who are peddling in bullshit, but you chose to question a number that isn't actually outside the realm of possibility and call it bullshit, which isn't helpful either.
I was considering various reports that said world will likely see 60 to 80% infections... combined with mortality rate...   https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/11/coronavirus-expert-warns-infection-could-reach-60-of-worlds-population
I'm really not such a big jerk :)... I also see in my super special reddit tools I've upvoted you more than almost anybody else on reddit. Your flair in my RES is super bright green.... "doing much better"... from your comment... yeah that is my feeling too. I didn't just say "unmanaged" I said **"totally unmanaged"**. In my own thinking I've been considering the difference between now and 1918. We are certainly going to do way better... Why not nail it?   The point about "totally unmanaged" is a reference to that recent thought space I've been in... If we roll back 100 years and introduce COVID 19... what happens? More or less dangerous than the last major human contagion?   I have no idea... but I believe 3 million out of 327 million would be a low end estimate of the mortality, BIG IF we do NOTHING SMART.   That's where I think we agree at least a little... do "much better".
Absolutely. This is nothing to joke about and especially older populations are going to experience much higher mortality rates. But the disaster fetish that reddit has is not helping anyone. This is not a world ending disease.
The weak in this case are the old people who want to continue down this path.  Their greed will literally kill them this time.
Non essential job roles can be sent home.  Freaking Liberty Mutual doesnt need to be at work packed in by the hundreds.  Truck drivers and Medical workers shouldnt be made to stay home obviously
I’m for not creating panic, but you do you.
> Edit: it wasn’t Charlotte. It was Rowan county  https://youtu.be/EKENXy2Z6Ag?t=4
That clearly says flu, this is not the flu. It is an entirelty different virus with different properties.
You realize the coronavirus isn’t the flu, right? It’s reasonable to _suspect_ that the coronavirus will act like the flu, with cases receding during the summer, but that’s hardly conclusive evidence.
Not even close to the same thing dude.   SARS or MERS would be closer to what can be expected, which DO NOT die down due to heat.   Unless you are actually educated on the topics at hand, please stop spreading ignorant information.   If you want to try to get some insight, perhaps you can read into the opinion of a Harvard epidemiologist.   https://ccdd.hsph.harvard.edu/will-covid-19-go-away-on-its-own-in-warmer-weather/
This is not the flu. Hell, it's not even in the same family of viruses. You can't expect it to act like the flu.
Jesus christ.
Also dry, not humid.
It's much, much closer to SARS than influenza, structurally. The virus is literally called SARS 2.
I just really think all the people pulling numbers out their asses and throwing out worst-case-possible scenarios as "likelihoods" is incredibly disingenuous, and that they're purposely doing it to frighten people that don't need to be frightened.   You have people on Reddit right now that are literally afraid to come out of their houses because of this shit. You have people who are stigmatizing Chinese and Asians over this. I've read people commenting that they're having anxiety attacks. I've read comments of people saying they can't sleep. So don't sit there and say that this kind of fear-mongering (like telling people 3,000,000 Americans will die this year from it) isn't ridiculous, or imply that it's beneficial in any way. IT'S NOT.
He didn't say it was "likely" he said it was "possible". You're making your own conclusions that this guy didn't even say.
Agreed. It’s more of a....gosh this is sick to verbalize..... a generation ending disaster for the Baby Boomers.
RemindMe! 2 weeks
This is SARS-2, SARS did quite well in the summer. I hate how people equate NCOV19 to the flu. It's like saying g dogs are people because they are both mammals.
Are you actually educated or just like talking down on people... Oh wait, you do like talking down on people, my bad.
But you do not know that.
>I just really think all the people pulling numbers out their asses and throwing out worst-case-possible scenarios as "likelihoods" is incredibly disingenuous, and that they're purposely doing it to frighten people that don't need to be frightened.   Most of these numbers are coming from reliable sources, like the CDC and the WHO. I'm not going to speak to the intent of others, but I'm not trying to frighten people. But I'm also not going to deny the potential scope of the problem.   >You have people on Reddit right now that are literally afraid to come out of their houses because of this shit.

So don't sit there and say that this kind of fear-mongering (like telling people 3,000,000 Americans will die this year from it) isn't ridiculous, or imply that it's beneficial in any way. IT'S NOT.  And we shouldn't be encouraging discussions that are promoting racism or unduly fear mongering, but again, downplaying the *actual* risk isn't helpful either because it can lull people into a false sense of security. It's important to understand that millions of people are very likely going to get really, really sick. We can't really prevent that at this point. What we *can* do is slow down the community spread to reduce the demand on the healthcare system (#flattenthecurve). And to do that, we need people to understand why we're going to have cancel travel plans, and forgo large gatherings, and maybe close schools. People need to actually start washing their hands, and forgo shaking hands. People need to understand the gravity of the situation, and you undermine that everytime you call something that is based on information from the experts "fake news".   By all means, challenge truly bullshit numbers, but if you think real numbers are being used inappropriately to instill panic, the answer isn't to downplay the number, it's to acknowledge the reality, put it in context and talk about what we can do in order to get the best possible outcome.
> a generation ending disaster for the Baby Boomers  It's really not that either. Hyperbole is not helpful. Science, statistics, and good hygiene are what we need right now. It's probably around a 6% rate for people 60-79 and we have around 80 Million people in the US in that age group. In a disastrous scenario where every single one of them gets it that is 4.8 Million deaths of 80 million, the generation lives on.

You're right, we can't say it won't improve during the summer. But we don't know if it will either. We can't make a definitive statement either way.
>you undermine that everytime you call something that is based on information from the experts "fake news".  Saying 3 million Americans will die from COVID-19 this year is 100% fake news. I'm done arguing.
Yeah, it's more Silent Generation than Boomers.  80+        15% mortality  70-79     8%  60-69     4%  https://www.bbc.com/news/health-51674743  But again, those seem to be deaths in a not-overwhelmed health care system. If we hit the limit on the number of patients our system can handle...who do you think the docs are going to triage?
You keep making these assumptions and it is just sad.
Is it probable? No. Is it possible? Yes, if we don't take action to slow the spread, it's possible. There's a very wide spectrum between "fake news" and "will totally happen", just like there's a breadth of options between calling everything bullshit and fear mongering. Though I suspect you know that, and just hate admitting you might be wrong. If that's the case, that's cool, just please consider what I said about why downplaying the risk is a bad idea. You get a lot of visibility on these threads, and you have a definite reputation for being conservative. If you choose to use your voice to support efforts to #flattenthecurve you could do a lot of good.   (Feel free to insult me to keep up your curmudgeony persona, but I suspect you're on here so much because you really do care about the community and I choose to believe you're actually going to think about this.)
And you keep seeming to collect down votes for your ignorant statements.   If you say nothing though, at least a few people might pay attention to facts being post, wash their hands more often and maybe save a few lives.   Might be the smart thing to do, but you don't seem to catch on do you?
> And you keep seeming to collect down votes for your ignorant statements.   I don't live off karma. Down vote me as hard as you possibly can, I'll still be commenting on this subreddit.  > Might be the smart thing to do, but you don't seem to catch on do you?   Why? So you can have the last word on this... naaa, I'll keep responding until the mods force us to stop.
It is just sad how you feel the need to belittle others; I doubt you do this in person, but on reddit your true self comes through as someone that needs to superior towards others. With this piss-poor attitude, you make these gross assumptions of who I am, my rational and an obvious attempt to degrade just to fit your narrative.   I hope one day in the future you seek out counseling as their are very obvious underlining issues I'm getting from each text you post.

We might be thinning the Bubba herd shortly.

Petition to temporarily close schools to stop spread of corona virus

Error 1005 Ray ID: 571cbf3628547465 • 2020-03-10 11:38:00 UTC Access denied   That takes care of the smart people...VPN users not welcome.
This is not needed at this point. No school means parents stay home, meaning many of them can’t work, meaning lost wages and even lost jobs.   We do need to do a better job testing and acting proactively to control the outbreak, but we don’t need to unnecessarily damage our economy out of irrational fear. If you’re someone who thinks closing all schools at this point, you’re just as bad as the Karen buying all 50 bottles of hand sanitizer as soon as they hit the shelves for herself.
If you do not want your kids to be at school, pull them out yourself, don't drag everyone else into your paranoia.
We need to be proactive in these times, starting now.  What you are suggesting is waiting and then being reactive.
Stop calling people names.  If you want to participate here you will behave yourself.
No, I'm suggesting rational precaution. I see that you're just spamming this to every subreddit you can think of though, so I guess you wouldn't understand that.
Yes sir Lowers head down and tucks tail in between legs.. and sits in his chair

Corona Virus test from commercial labs has been made available starting this past Monday. Still ramping up though, and other sources may be coming up as well.

But if the media wants to make money from me why are they canceling all the events that make them a lot of money? March Madness for example is a huge cash cow for advertising, tickets and selling food for parties to viewers especially in North Carolina that’s just gone now.
None of the articles mention NC at all so not sure why you would post this here.
Removed: rule 5
The media still makes money with news and other program, as people are becoming more stuck at home.
Don’t be silly, everything is a conspiracy these days 🤣🤣
