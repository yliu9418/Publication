Duke-linked COVID-19 cases jumps to 26
http://9thStreetJournal.org
buckle up
Duke is really good at driving up that COVID-19 numbers this week.
If you read the article, they were students who returned from a trip abroad and are in quarantine.
They are diaper dandies baby!
Yes, I think we're all aware that is the official statement, but on multiple social networks, different people have said individuals from this trip were seen out on Ninth Street and that the Dean had seen them as well.   That's the concern.

A Wake County resident who attended The Millennium Tour 2020 at PNC Arena on March 13 has tested positive for COVID-19 and was symptomatic while attending the event.

>The person was at the concert from 8:20 p.m. Friday, March 13, to midnight Saturday, March 14. The individual had floor seats in Section 5 but moved throughout the crowd during the show.  >"Because the crowd was so mobile, it would be very difficult determine who came within six feet of the affected person for 10 minutes or more," said Wake County Medical Director Dr. Kim McDonald. "If you went to the show and spent time on the floor, you may be at risk of exposure."  >The Wake County Public Health Division has set up a special information line for people who attended the show or worked at PNC Arena on March 13. Affected Wake County residents can call 919-857-9375.  >Wake County is also emailing anyone who bought tickets to the concert to inform them about the situation advise them on next steps. At this time, the county does not believe anyone at PNC Arena outside of the above-mentioned timeframe was at risk of contracting COVID-19.

Coronavirus NC updates: At least 636 cases of COVID-19 reported in NC and Stay At Home Orders


First North Carolina novel coronavirus case confirmed in Wake County

Hand Sanitizer is already gone from Food Lion on Hwy 55. Not that I was gonna buy it, but people are already panic buying stuff. Gonna be "hurricane" buying season here soon
Wash.Your.Damn.Hands.
GREAAAAAAAAAAAAAT.
Don't worry guys, Thom Tillis is in direct communication with Mike Pence. He got this, nothing to worry about nothing to see here.  Oh wait a kid who shook hands with Mike Pence was just quarantined. Huh. Mike Pence wouldn't scratch his nose after that. Oh wait. Fuck.
NC's emergency management is absolutely top notch. There's no way to be 100% safe, but we are lucky to have the EM professionals that we do.
Nooooooooo !!
Wow it's weird to see this and think it was only 4 weeks ago
Hand Sanitizer, wipes and masks are long gone.
hand sanitizer is anti-bacterial  the COVID-19 is a VIRUS.    C'mon people.
I trust no one to wash their hands. Some people are pretty sloppy. 😣😣😣
Remember - washing your hands should take at least 20 seconds, or the length of the abc’s.   Put water on your hands, then soap, then scrub, then rinse.
The kid didn’t shake hands with Pence, his classmates did. Some article titles were somewhat misleading. Kid and his mom were quarantined when his classmates met Pence. [Source](https://www.newsweek.com/student-sarasota-military-academy-whose-classmates-shook-hands-mike-pence-now-under-coronavirus-1490261?amp=1)
Seems more like Cooper's purview.
Sadly there is probably still soap which is what people really should be using
Can’t believe people still think masks made for sawdust will keep them from breathing in a virus amidst all of the news saying otherwise. Contracting it may be stopped from a mask but wearing one to avoid it does nothing but make you look goofy.
Hand sanitizer is not exclusively antibacterial. Active ingredient is alcohol, which inactivates many viruses as well as kills bacteria.
You're not the best.
This. I think you all remember my friend Poppy.
This is why I wash my hands instead. Go to a public restroom? Wash my hands in then use hand sanitizer after touching any door handle on the way out. After I go to a store before I eat at a restaurant, especially at the gym. Ppl are gross man. So gross. I assume no one washes and do my best.
Want to get really freaked, watch people touch their faces constantly.
I'm just quoting Thommy Boy's press release yesterday.  Yes, Cooper is the executive of NC, and I trust him a whole lot more than the anti-science and anti-vaxxer children running the federal executive.  The truth is this country is not prepared. At all. We are so vulnerable. Even if coronavirus passes by, there's always next time. But the fact they are calling this a "Democrat hoax" is terrifying, and I fear it's only a matter of time before Tillis and Burr follow suit calling it a hoax.
yeah, if people think an anti-bacterial will work on a virus....
yeah, but if you are sick, wearing any sort of mask is better than not.  (which i why the healthy people should stop hoarding them, gdi)
Yeah, it was a bad time to regrout my shower. I couldn’t find a mask anywhere and I wasn’t about to pay $35 for a 5 pack of disposable loop ones from Home Depot.
It’s not airborne to the point where a mask is necessary, unless you’re caring for someone with it. And even then it can just get into your body through your eyes anyway
You can also pick up covid 19 on surfaces. A mask would keep you from inadvertently touching your face.
I think the N95 masks are more so for flying or if you have to be in a crowded space, but its not something to wear out and about.
Yes
I love this response.
No, but Ive used gas station bathrooms in times of desperation and people concern me 😷🤢
They contain alcohol so actually they likely will make some difference.
Exactly, wear it if you’re sick. If you’re healthy just keep washing your hands
Bandanna works in a pinch for that kind of work. Wet it if ultra dusty.
Yeah, I just looked it up, alcohol doesn't kill some viruses, but covid19 can be killed by it.
I tried and couldn’t breathe so I got panicky!
Time to get the liquor store!
Respect.
Second suggestion, [ninja t-shirt mask.](https://m5.paperblog.com/i/98/983267/top-10-things-to-make-with-old-t-shirts-L-iU53YK.jpeg)

You can get Denatured Ethanol in gallon containers from hardware stores. I use it to make my own surface/glass cleaner.
YESSS! This is the answer I needed. Thank you for your super practical advice!

Novel coronavirus case reported in Wake County


Information about the Coronavirus from the Durham County Department of Public Health

A sub with a bit more for all NC  r/CoronaNC
I found this to be a very rational and informative assessment of the COVID-19 situation, would encourage everyone to read through:  https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fczap3/-/fjeg66g  Essentially, it's incredibly likely that the virus was in the US well before the first positive test. So, for a place like Seattle, it's likely that a huge portion of the population already has or had it. Despite that, Seattle has not turned into some grotesque, plaque-ridden city with dead people in the streets. In fact, the vast, vast majority of the people there who have likely had the virus didn't even know it.  There are daily not-stop flights and, I'm sure dozens of other ways to travel between Seattle and RDU (or anywhere else in the country for that matter)  So, if you take this to its logical conclusion for our region, while we have two positive tests, the virus is almost certainly here and probably has been for quite some time. But, like Seattle, we aren't seeing people drop dead in the streets or anything.   The point of all this is, if you are in reasonably good health and are not elderly, the best thing you could possibly do right now is to help protect our elderly and immunocompromised communities. We should be offering to run to the store for an elderly neighbor's groceries or to run various errands for them instead of buying up every mask on the planet and stockpiling hand sanitizer like we're characters from Mad Max looking for fuel. Unless you work with an at risk community, you also don't need to get tested because, odds are you won't ever even know you had it to begin with. If you get any flu-like symptoms, try to minimize the time you're out amongst others and try to wash your hands and follow the rules of good hygiene.  This isn't to minimize the fact that people are scared, I totally get that and I'd be lying if I said I didn't share some of those fears. But these are the times when it's important for us, as a community, to take a moment, step back from the situation and objectively assess our priorities. Right now, if you take into account the entirety of the information we have, those priorities are our at-risk communities and health care workers. So let's make sure they have what they require to stay safe and/or continue to provide care to those of us who are in need, whether because of COVID-19 or something entirely unrelated.
Found this on the who website "Shortage of personal protective equipment endangering health workers worldwide". Funny last week a friend told me that all over the Triangle stores are empty. I did not believe him.    https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/03-03-2020-shortage-of-personal-protective-equipment-endangering-health-workers-worldwide
Their testing criteria are still too strict. They will not pick up any community spread cases this way.
It’s a strange place to be.   If you honestly haven’t had contact with anyone who is *confirmed* to have COVID-19 or traveled internationally to one of the hot spots....by these rules you shouldn’t be tested.  If you have any common sense, you realize that if you have flu-like symptoms (I.e. not the walking well, but rather a dry cough, fever, muscle aches, lethargy)....you should probably invent a fictitious recent trip to Italy so you can get your ass tested.
Stickied for visibility.
Oh god. Do I dare join.
I’m from northern Italy and I live in Durham. my friends and family, some of which work in healthcare, have told me the hospital system there is nearing capacity in terms of ICU beds and hospital personnel. True, for most people it’s not a dangerous disease. but it is dangerous for some, especially if they can’t get treatment for lack of resources. so watch out, be safe, start being careful now and not when it’s too late.
>Despite that, Seattle has not turned into some grotesque, plaque-ridden city with dead people in the streets. In fact, the vast, vast majority of the people there who have likely had the virus didn't even know it.  Hiroshima 5 minutes before the bomb: A B-29 flew over the city but nothing has happened. Nothing is on fire, no buildings have been destroyed.   &#x200B;  The virus was circulating in a *nursing home* for anywhere from 1 to 24 days before anyone knew it. Everyone in that nursing home probably has it. People came in to visit their loved ones, hugged them, kissed them. They took it home and spread it to their family. They took it to work and school and spread it to their coworkers and classmates. Repeat ad infinitum.   It has a ***one to twenty-four day*** incubation period before symptoms appear. Suggesting that because Seattle hasn't devolved into a scene out of The Walking Dead means it isn't going to is absurd and fallacious.   >If you get any flu-like symptoms, try to minimize the time you're out amongst others and try to wash your hands and follow the rules of good hygiene  This one is downright fucking dangerous. If you get any flu-like symptoms, immediately self quarantine for two weeks to reduce spreading it as much as possible. Don't "minimize" the time you're around other people, eliminate it as much as possible.  &#x200B;  Our schools should be closed. Our offices should be closed. Retail stores should be closed. We need to write up policies and procedures for grocery stores to reduce transmission. Non-critical flights should be grounded. Ports should be closed to non-critical supplies. Conventions, sporting events, concerts, etc should be cancelled or rescheduled for later in the year. We should be dedicating resources to figuring out how to get food, water. We need to order insurers and pharmacies to work together to get prescriptions to people. We need to order insurers to provide free testing and treatment for Coronavirus.  "STOP IT YOU WILL CAUSE A PANIC!!!"   Yes, I will. Things will get worse for a few days or a week or two, and people will be scared. I'd rather people get scared than get sick and die. Yes, there will hoarding and there will be violence. If we don't do these things and wait for it to get worse, those things will get worse.   China restricted the movement of **780,000,000** people. But over here we're just pretending it's not a problem so let's let it spread.
But they don't have the supplies to test everyone.  Makes sense.  Use them on high probability cases rather than Worrying Walter that comes in because of the sniffles.
Ah yes, lie to get a test that isn't medically indicated.  Smart.
No. Fear mongering and idiocy running rampant.  When we can test for it more broadly, the rates will spike and the sky will fall.
But what about those high healthcare costs amirite
That’s the rub, isn’t it? The test is *medically* indicated, but for some reason FDA/CDC et al are not allowing doctors to order the test unless some non-medical boxes are checked.
Paging Dr. Reddit.  Paging Dr. Reddit.  Sniffle, cough, fever....MEDICAL INDICATION FOR TESTING FOT CORONA VIRUS!
Because we don't have the resources to test every worrying Walter that comes into the clinic because off the sniffles.  You can lie about symptoms to get the test, but that doesn't change the treatment plan, bed rest with plenty of water and isolation.  That should be the standard protocol for any flu-like symptoms COVID-19 or not.
There needs to be a profit to test. This is America not communist Venezuela.
We totally have the resources. It’s a nasal swab (few cents) followed by an RNA isolation (cheap kit), followed by a reverse transcriptase reaction (<$1), followed by a TaqMan real time PCR test (<$1). The reagents are pubic knowledge and can all be ordered from oligo synthesis companies and Amazon-sized biotech companies (ThermoFisher).   What you mean is, for some either political or competency reason, enough kits have not even delivered to doc offices.
There needs to be a reason to test.  Your treatment protocol doesnt change with a positive test.
Lol  Ok sure.
South Korea has tested over 140k people so far, I don't think the person you responded to is so far off base.
The mechanics are on. The prices are off. But the kits weren't working because they screwed up the manufacturing early. So, no we currently do not have the supplies because of a goof in reagents (remember to check your best by dates on your Kits!).   To then think we'd be able to start over and distribute the kits in a matter of two weeks is also ridiculous when most of the kits he's talking about are produced in Germany. So no, we currently do not have the supplies because of manufacturing capabilities and logistic problems.
How far off are the prices?  \-screwing up early manufacturing (combined with refusing the kits offered by the WHO)   \- "a goof" in reagents    both read to me like major political or competency issues.  Furthermore, two weeks is a much shorter timeline to investigate and fix this particular issue than it's been a known problem.

NC Coronavirus Update - Latest on # of infected and outlook for more testing
As the coronavirus outbreak continues, there is some confusion and misinformation about what is happening in North Carolina.Here are the facts as of March 9, 1:30 p.m.:**Current Status: Two Cases in North Carolina**Wake County - Individual traveled from State of Washington, where they were exposed at a long-term care facility. The person is doing well and is in isolation at home.Chatham County - Individual traveled to Italy and also had contact with someone who was confirmed positive in Georgia. The person is doing well and is in isolation at home.In addition, an individual in Spartanburg, SC, who has tested positive recently returned from Italy through Charlotte's airport. There are currently NO reported cases in Mecklenburg.**Current Testing Roadblocks**NC has begun testing cases at the NC State Laboratory of Public Health, which allows for faster results (24-hour turnaround time).However, NC has not received the number of kits we had hoped to receive from the CDC. Two factors are making this a more critical situation.  * First, the CDC changed their testing guidelines to increase the number of people who should be tested.  * Second, the case in Chatham County will likely result in a need for more tests.The laboratory supplies we have on-hand from the CDC are only adequate to test approximately 150 individuals. Additional supplies en route to NC, however those incoming shipments will only allow us to test an additional 500 people, far below what is needed under the new CDC guidance. In addition, a small portion of our supplies will be earmarked to perform confirmatory testing for our state’s clinical laboratory partners – per federal requirements – while they implement their own testing for COVID-19.Our NC DHHS sent a letter to Secretary Azar explaining the situation and critical need for more test kits. They have been in contact with our federal delegation and have had communication with the White House.**Testing Outlook**Our NC DHHS signed an agreement with UNC on Wednesday and Duke on Thursday so they can begin testing\*.\* UNC will be able to start testing early this week. We are still waiting on confirmation for the Duke timeline. However, the shortage of testing kits from the CDC will also hamper their ability to test the number of people we should be testing based on the new CDC guidance.In addition, LabCorps will begin testing in the next couple of weeks. They have a 3-4 day turnaround time at this point. They will be using their own test so they won't be limited by the CDC supply issues. LabCorps will eventually help some of the volume, but it will take time to ramp up. Also, that turnaround time is a challenge because the folks that LabCorps test will need to stay quarantined 3-4x longer than the ones we test (assuming they're negative - positives will have the same isolation period). **State Preparation & Constituent Resources**Last month, Governor Roy Cooper established the COVID-19 Task Force to support the state’s ongoing effort to monitor, prepare for and respond to COVID-19.He also ordered the creation of the COVID-19 Helpline toll free at 1-866-462-3821. To ask questions online NC citizens should visit [www.ncpoisoncontrol.org](http://www.ncpoisoncontrol.org/) and select “chat.”**Requests for the Public**If and when community transmission accelerates, then slowing the rate of infection will be key to making sure our hospitals are not overwhelmed. Follow these recommendations not just to protect yourself and your family, but to help slow the overall rate of infection to make sure that our hospitals don't get hit all at once:* Wash your hands several times a day with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer if soap and water are not available.* Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your sleeve (not your hands) when coughing or sneezing.* Avoid exposure to others who are sick.* Stay home when you are ill.I will keep you posted as we learn more.\- Sen. Jeff Jackson
I've heard that the Chatham county person is/has been in contact with a Chatham county family that has children in the school system here.  Has the Health Department contacted this school?
Thank you Senator!  He is up for re-election, consider donating to his campaign.
there is no “s” at the end of LabCorp
Thx for not making this political
So the individiual from SC that tested positive went through Charlottes airport...
Thank you for the update. I appreciate your communication efforts here on the subreddits.

I hope working from home becomes the norm for all RTP companies after this mess. That alone will (at least partially) solve a bunch of problems that the failed light rail proposal was trying to fix
He does not represent our district.
this is was seriously bothering me, too. :) but all in all glad for the post!
The failed light rail that wasnt going anywhere near RTP?
So what.  I'm donating.  If he loses his seat it's a loss for the state.
Yeah, wasn't the idea to "reduce congestion" on Durham roads? IIRC, most of Durham's residents work in an office in some capacity. Expanding remote work to most companies and small businesses in the area, would do more to take cars off the road (even if it's not 100% WFH) than light rail would.
I don't believe in attempting to effect change via political donations in districts that are not your own.
WFH is absolutely a better plan than any rigid rail plan.
You mean affect.  Thanks for sharing.
I'd bet the people downvoting me are the same ones who would disagree with Citizens United. Think about it.
> You mean affect.  I don't.
I thought about it, and there's no contradiction. Citizens United doesn't deal with that kind of donation. And even if it did, you could easily disagree with the decision but then determine that it makes sense to play within the rules it sets out, rather than unilaterally disarm.
That's some impressive use of grammar! It took me a sec, but damn!
"Getting money out of politics" seems to be the rallying cry. Are you ok with the Koch's funding GOP candidates against the DNC ones here in NC even though they don't live here?
I guess I would prefer that the law prevented it. But since that the law doesn't prevent it, I want people on my side to maximize the efficacy of their own contributions, within the current legal structure.

Thanks Biogen: State of Emergency declared in North Carolina as coronavirus outbreak spreads

As a reminder, a state of emergency doesn’t mean all hell has broken loose. It simply allows the state access to additional federal funding for preparations, supplies, and mitigation.
....Its dumb to blame Biogen, it could have been any number of conferences and other cases came from elsewhere.   But I do find it very Ironic that a company that has some of the highest level protocols for contamination on the books is now a hub.
My wife works in the research triangle... This fucking sucks, I'm not worried about getting sick, I just don't want to have to sit at home for two fucking weeks and use my PTO.   Think of how many of these people have families that sent their kids to school....   DAMNIT
At least we aren't blaming InGen for mistakes... yet
Whatever man, life fucking has to move on. Keep fucking living your life, wash your hands, and stay home if you don’t feel well.
The guy voted at a very popular early polling site on the last day of early voting. F.
Oh great, I work two blocks away from Biogen.
Oh god, no!! I need mooooore toilet paper¡!!!
I know your game, you're trying to get us all complacent while you buy up all the toilet paper. Nice try, pal.
You're absolutely right.  I was in San Francisco when they announced the State of Emergency there, before a single confirmed case in the area.
Good bot
It's something that could have been easily avoided.
They're making you use pto? That's a bit fukt... of course I'm a tax-doer so I'll die of the plague at my desk efiling someone's return with my last breath.
Hopefully work from home gets expanded across the board for all companies in RTP, and on a permanent basis. Imagine the benefits of less cars on the road. That will even help the people who can't do remote work
Two of our higher-ups at the company I work at in RTP were in contact with some of the Biogen people. They are passing out hygiene kits tomorrow and most likely implementing work from home for non-essential employees.
What's the over/under on the Umbrella Corp right now?
It's not about life having to "move on". It's about making sure our healthcare system does not collapse.   The average stay in hospital is 10 days with covid-19. I'll let you do the math to figure out how quickly Duke, Wake Med, UNC would be overwhelmed.

It wasn't Durham County South Regional Library, was it?
Good thing it can’t travel two blocks.
It’s actually the lysol wipes I’m after.
The TP shortage forced me dust off the ole bidet
Bidet companies like Tushy are blowing up my social feeds. If only I had a warm water line next to my toilet in my apartment.
 In the land of the shit show the two ply man will be king
More like, they’ve only tested person with it.
Seriously shaming folks for contracting an illness is a shitty thing to do!
Nope, but I am interested to listen now.  ...and yes, of course, it could have been avoided, it all could be avoided - we just need to all lock ourselves inside and hope the virus goes away before we starve to death: easy!
Do tell...
My company is an English company so who knows. They do pay us and not take our PTO when its weather related
As long as kids are in daycare, schools, etc this thing is going to flourish.
Yes
THIS RIGHT HERE. I work for one of the hospitals. Someone at Biogen's spouse works here was exposed to a bunch of sick people. Just a reminder that doctors, nurses and social workers can't really work from home.
Booom. This. Also, I feel like we are luckier here in this area as far as healthcare vs some places. Even then, it’s going to become overloaded.
America doesn’t have enough hospital beds if this goes crazy.
That’s not what I’m talking about, but thanks tho.   You’re assuming everyone and their fucking mom is going to get sick from this, that’s just not going to happen. Like this is just getting out of hand. We can’t compare what’s happening in other countries to us ie Italy. Our demographics are not quite the same, and the way we interact and live is just different.   I’m not going to live under a fucking rock because of this. I can’t.
Nah, in Raleigh
I still drive by it omw home. I'll just keep the windows up. :)
I've just been telling people to coat their hands in ranch: Can't shake hands, won't touch your face, makes food taste better and the shelves are full!
Dude lysol wipes *are not* a substitute for toilet paper.  I won't make that mistake twice...
We all have showers too, right? Toilet paper doesn't seem like the biggest necessity here, I'd only be worried about food if anything
Drop in bidets have their own heater. I have a bio bidet and the install was very easy.
Is your shitter near your sink?
... by not having a conference. Plenty of employers had already moved to essential travel only
Yeah, and this is a perfect opportunity to show how shitty the American healthcare system is, but.....Like......so much of this is just too much.
In NC we are better suited than most with 2 of the best hospitals in the world located in our center (UNC and Duke).   Even more, we have what is one of the best emergency management departments in the country and possibly the world. NCEM is completely and totally prepared to handle anything that goes beyond what hospitals can handle.
No one does.
76% of the people infected in Italy were over 50:  https://www.iss.it/en/primo-piano/-/asset_publisher/o4oGR9qmvUz9/content/id/5292020  Link is in Italian but can be translated to English. So while everyone may not get this, their mom's likely will....
And you shouldn't. People need to just do the hand washing, stay home if they're sick, and be reasonable.
This is an excellent idea. People will purposely avoid anyone randomly covered in ranch and absolutely nobody will talk to you, either! #winwin
Ive got a soft bath mat, I'm good.
...and plenty haven't because there has been no requirement to do so.  Hysteria is a hell of a drug.
I'm not sure of the details, but do you have any idea how much goes into events like this...canceling over what is basically the new Flu that's just overblown by the media?   Not to say you can't take some precautions and limit some things: but as a director of a global healthcare non-profit, we might have to fire 2 or 3 staff because of how Universities are over reacting.
No hospital system is really built out for this anywhere in the world: hence China building "tent" hospitals that are now being taken down.   ... honestly medical equipment and tests are the real bottle neck. If it gets bad enough around here I bet the current owners of Northgate Mall will have some ideas....
We have the best system in the world to handle something like this.
Shout out to every single person working in any capacity in an Emergency Department these days.....
Median age range for Italian is 10+ years higher than ours in the states. I don’t think we can quite compare that stat fairly when we’re using it to bolster infection rates for US.   Thank god for teen pregnancy, amirite?
This ain’t the “new flu.” Entire countries don’t go on lock down bc of the flu.
bAsIcAlLy tHe nEw fLu
If it gets really bad, I've always assumed they will commandeer the public schools as fever clinics.
Taken down ? They’re collapsing and killing people.
You're correct.   But even then I worry about our elderly population. Mass infection of the elderly would put a huge strain on our country economically and socially, and even though who knows how our shitty healthcare could even cope.   I'm not panicking over the situation, but I'm definitely concerned.
Username is hilarious in context.
Medically it is: Corona is same class as other outbreaks we've seen like SARs, it'll happen again and again: we'll develop a vaccine, like the Flu. It will begin to come and go seasonally killing mostly old people with co-morbidity.   There was a flu pandemic that was similar to this in the 20s I think: we are just now learning about Coronavirus and are reacting accordingly.
Uh, please provide reference. Haven't heard anything about that, but wouldn't be surprised either.
I am coming off as quite callous, I will admit. Like you said, panicked, no, concerned sure. I’m an extremely healthy young person, but also an independent contractor so I do worry about the state of my job. I can’t hurt myself stressing over things that haven’t come to pass yet.  This is a perfect opportunity to build our community, seeing what our neighbors need and how we can help, in just the smallest of ways. I hope that we can stand together stronger to fight our government to give us what we NEED - a better health care system, live able wages, and systems that ensure we’re all taken care of STRESS FREE in situations like this.   ( this comment brought to you by frustration that this is being taken OVERLY serious while more pressing matters have been put on the back burner for years -read global warming)
Do we have a vaccine for SARS? No. And you can’t assume this will die down once the temps change as there is no data to support that statement at this time. You are referring to the Spanish Flu and how many ppl did that kill?  As far as this happening again? Totally agree. China is ripe with untold shit that will eventually cause stronger viruses. Their food markets are so f’ing terrible and ripe for outbreak.
Why so hostile? It’s international news.    https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2020/03/07/china/china-coronavirus-hotel-collapse/index.html
Lol: that has nothing to do with what I'm talking about. Tragic, but not related to wind down of infection in China.    And not an example of "tent" hospitals they built asap, this was another location they utilized.

In response to coronavirus, Duke suspends in-person classes

Just waiting for them to tell me I can work from home.
Smart. Entire county should be suspended for 14 days
Forbidden blueberries and raspberries
I'm praying they don't close the gym.  I can't not work out for a month.
NC public schools need to act now.
Nope we need you to come in and get sick.
It’s got to be coming for most roles.
Oh im sure its happening. I think the presidents message was geared mostly toward student though, and employee planning will be left to the various schools/depts. i know on the duke coronavirus page they said all depts should prepare for WFH
My work is doing a "trial run" this Friday to ensure we'd still be operational should we do a full shutdown.
It will all be fun and games until people start getting fired due to shrinking revenues.
Yep. My partner works for durham county and im pissed he hasnt been told anything. He works in close contact w the public and im about to start hounding him to just take sick time
Right!?!? LOL.
Do youtube videos! I use fitnessblender, its free and they have HIIT, weights, pilates, etc
Public schools are coming. Just wait until a student, parent or teacher test positive.
I also work for the county and I’m not holding my breath for us being told to even work from home. I mean, I hope so - it certainly seems the reasonable thing to do. But I just don’t know that I see it happening County-wide.
thanks, I was looking for some more fitness videos!
Thanks haha.  I told my boss I owed him a coke if we didn't get that email today.  I went to walmart on the way home and got a bench, a bar/plates, and a pull up bar.  All I can do is make the best of it.
The school of science and math jus had a group of kids return from Italy. They weren’t tested and were put right back into the fold with everyone else. We’ll see in a week or two how good of a decision that was.
Family just had a relative return from Italy and is already self quarantining themselves. The rest of the family is free though, saw the dad on Sunday at a church event and the youngest kid goes to my school
Parent in Raleigh tested positive https://abc11.com/6000707/
Im assuming this would be treated like snow days. You get PTO and arent expected to work. This is just extra pissing me off rn bc with the malware attack my partner just goes into work and mills around basically. Its fucking dumb af. They are not going to do anything until its too late and i straight up told him just to not go into work bc the library (where he works) isnt even cancelling programs. Clearly they are living under a rock.
Seriously?!?! That seems irresponsible.
It's only gonna get worse before people start actually staying home if they feel sick.
HA!   I worked at Duke for more than a decade (in multiple departments). When we were "closed" because of weather, it was expected that:    a) your work still got done,    b) you didn't come to campus (you could be fired for it), and    c) you had to claim the day as vacation/PTO.
Oh I’m doing the same thing and have the same feelings, trust me! It’s so absurd that I’m at work and basically twiddling my thumbs all day long. I’m just not holding out hope that they’re going to give everyone 2 weeks of admin days (or any, really), even though now would be the ideal time!
Here’s the news article (mentioned halfway down). They are taking their temperatures every day, but that still doesn’t seem great. But I’m not an expert.    https://www.wral.com/nc-s-second-coronavirus-case-originated-in-italy-chatham-man-now-isolated-at-home/18996626/
I currently work at duke and it is protocol that in severe weather, you work from home or take vacation time. So it is incorrect that you have to work and also claim the day as vacstion.
Right i agree. I just wish there was someone i could complain to but you know... email and phones arent working -_- luckily we are ok if he does just stay home and that has repurcussions. We are young and healthy and i want to keep it that way! There are so many older county employees who the cdc is actually recommending stay home.
In the departments I worked for (monthly-paid employee, Levels > 10), working from home was verboten, so… if we weren't in our offices, we using time off. But work still had to be done on time.  I literally had a superior who explained that my obligation to do work was paramount to everything else; as he put it: "you're on salary, we own you."  ETA: Duke's a big organization. Like any big organization, there's the official policy and the effective policy. This was simply my experience in multiple departments. There are things I loved about working there and things I didn't. This is one of the latter.

Duke moves on-campus classes online to prevent coronavirus

And undergrad students who are away for spring break to NOT return to campus “if possible”.    And all graduate and professional students to be put “on notice” for when to resume.....  Graduation??!? What is going on?

Coronavirus - why you should take this seriously starting right now
Some people are asking what's the big deal over coronavirus in NC when there are "only" seven confirmed cases.Three reasons:1. There are almost certainly more than seven actual cases. The truth is we are under-testing due to a national shortage of test kits (more on this later).2. Nationally, the number of infected people appears to be doubling roughly every week. That means we have exponential growth, which is difficult to conceptualize but basically means it starts off slow but then rapidly grows. It means we could go from 100 cases to 1,600,000 in roughly 14 weeks - absent successful containment.3. We don't have a vaccine (it's at least a year away) and - since we've never been exposed to this virus before - no one has any immunity built up.We should know relatively soon whether this will be contained. If it isn't, then the focus is going to be on slowing the rate of infection so our hospitals don't become overwhelmed. We do not want a situation like they have in northern Italy where this got completely out of hand in a matter of weeks and clogged all the hospitals.So we're washing our hands very often and refraining from handshakes and being otherwise sensible not just to keep ourselves healthy, but also to help slow the overall rate of infection to make sure hospitals can treat everyone who needs it.Part of my job is making sure you have reliable information as this situation develops, so when I learn new things from DHHS I will update you.Talk soon,Sen. Jeff Jackson
Can you please champion the use of drive through testing and make it free for all? It is working marvelously in South Korea. People just drive up to a parking lot, stay in their car, get swabbed and then have the results sent to them digitally.  The cost of tests will pail in comparison to multiple industries collapsing (retail, travel, restaurants, healthcare, etc).
Hi there. Thanks for being present here. Question — you said...  >We should know relatively soon whether this will be contained  What do you mean by 'contained' here?  and, followup: if we have exponential growth, an incomplete vision of the infection numbers, and no clear path to establishing a sufficient testing + quarantine plan, what's the plan for establishing containment?
Due to the unfortunate lack of testing we have really fallen behind the 8 ball. I am a local Primary Care Physician and at this time the main problem is that we have no idea which patients we should be testing. There is so much overlap with influenza and other common respiratory viruses that it is impossible to tell, unless someone was recently in China or Italy and has a high fever. Basically it could be spreading through the community as we speak, but at this point we are all in the dark. I'm not sure what the plan is going forward from a national perspective in terms of testing availability, but until that changes and I can perform a rapid test on par with the flu testing, it is going to continue to spread and containment will get more difficult. At this point most of my colleagues have accepted the fact that we will most likely be getting the virus if the spread continues. Sorry for the grim outlook, but unfortunately we have a president that doesn't believe in science and decided to not fund task forces that could have prevented this spread in the first place. But at least the Dow almost hit 30,000 recently :S
Senator Jackson,  I have family in Italy, they live in Sicily and I've seen and went through the medical system there. If it hit's Sicily we will see thousands of deaths. The medical system in Northern Italy is light years ahead of the south.
I was judged pretty hard for not shaking a person's hand last night when we were introduced to each other. Anecdotally, about half of the people I've talked to this week are taking it seriously.
Good thing we build all those aircraft carriers rather than medical infrastructure. Yeah it a big deal and if we relied on government, we’d be screwed!
Thanks.
This article explains very well why this is a big deal NOW, with amazing charts and graphs:  https://medium.com/@tomaspueyo/coronavirus-act-today-or-people-will-die-f4d3d9cd99ca
Thank you, Senator. One question for you, if you have a moment: exactly how much toilet paper should I have to effectively fight off the virus?
Points one and two are important. However my view is that point two will definitely occur once we have kits because the infection rate has already started climbing because the virus is here and has been here.  Not a statistician,  wont there be inherent sample bias baked in when we actually start testing because as more kits are available the rate will increase regardless?  My point being what is the actual baseline to draw the conclusion that there is exponential growth.  Not making light of this at all, I’m very worried for my extended family.
I never expected it to reach America, yet here we are, lol. This is gonna get big faster than people realize because of how contagious the disease is. No one is saying the apocalypse is happening tomorrow, but the impact is real. It’s only just started, too. It will get even more out of control and cause more damage if it grows exponentially.
Thanks for communicating with us. Glad I live here.
Thanks Jeff! I miss you being my Senator.
Just speaking anecdotally as a parent of a preschooler--we've had quite a few illnesses going around the classroom and coming home over the past few months. Now, this is quite normal for daycare this time of year, and we haven't really thought anything of it. In years past we've had everything from cold and flu to hand foot and mouth.   However, we do know quite a few kids and parents who've been sick since January with upper respiratory infections and have tested positive for either pneumonia or bronchitis. None of them have been tested for coronavirus AFAIK, because they didn't fit the criteria. But it's quite possible that this has already been going around the community.
No mention of capacity. Doctors and labs still take time and space to test.   It is irresponsible to glibly say “there are plenty of teats, don’t worry” when there is no statistic.   And again, that was a labcorp PR release. They didn’t even mention numbers when tooting their own horn. Bad faith assumption is that it was to bolster stock prices in a nose diving market.
What do you make of the Ohio Governor's estimate that they have 100k cases there? Is our govt prepared to say something similar and take action as if 1% had the virus? Especially protecting our most at-risk people and securing economic situations for the lowest-paid workers, who will also be the ones working beyond any voluntary recommendations because they need the money and putting their health at risk to do so?
I really appreciate this post, and the info provided.   I have a slightly less doomy look on it, and think it will subside sooner than a year - I’m also seeing that Wuhan is sending it’s people back to work. What’s happening there that’s making things go back to normal from looking like a dystopian horror movie?
Thanks Senior Jeff Jackson.
https://www.labcorp.com/information-labcorp-about-coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19
What do you make of business capitalizing off of this? This seems incredible irresponsible to bring kids together after schools have been released. https://ibb.co/sVT54cQ
Jeff, there is NO shortage of test kits.  Both LabCorp and Quest can test for COVID19  However, one can’t just go to a patient service center and request the test, you need to go through a physician.
By 'contained,' I mean whether exponential growth occurs in NC. And then, if and when that occurs, the question will be how quickly can we fatten that growth curve, as they have in China.  In other words, if it goes from seven cases to 1,000 within the next few weeks it will be clear that "sustained community transmission" is occurring, and that's when things really start shutting down in an effort to mitigate and slow the rate of infection.
that sucks, and I'm very sorry our health care workers are going to have to fight this fight.  I would only point out that you can run the standard respiratory virus panel and determine if the febril patient has one of the flu bugs going around, or one of the standard coronaviruses that are on the panel. If they have the flu or a known coronavirus, they almost certainly don't have COVID19 and don't need to be quarantined. If they test negative for all of those and are still exhibiting the signs of COVID19, you can start assuming they have it until you can get proper testing done.  &#x200B;  China ran into this same basic problem. They had the WHO test kit up and running, but not at scale. As the "normal" flu and coronaviruses don't cause pneumonia, Docs were running chest CTs on patients. If they had pneumonia, they assumed it was COVID19. In some cases docs were stacking multiple patients in CT machines, which is not super safe but that goes to show their efforts to move expeditiously. I think of it how the US put millions of dollars into developing a pen that would write in zero gravity for the astronauts while Russia sent their guys with pencils. Gotta use the tools at your disposal.   &#x200B;  And no joke, thanks again for your efforts.
Thank you for your work.
Interesting: I work in global health. Could you expand/explain.   I would generally agree about rural healthcare, but from what I've seen in this region is pretty good: the hospital in Hillsborough is practically an over staffed ghost town.
Tell them you just got back from Italy and see if they still want to shake.
It’s not a bad practice.  However since you shared air with them, if they have it, you were exposed.  This is a respiratory illness, and transmitted through the air.  Edit: exposure does not mean infected
I would love to see this analysis corroborated by experts in the field. The author himself doesn't appear to be especially qualified.
N + 5 cases, where N is the amount you currently have in your stockpile.
It's equally contagious as the flu, but 10-20x deadlier
i had wondered the same. my brother (not in NC), who is very healthy and fit, came down with a cough and shortness of breath, which lasted about 6 weeks. his started in January. he is better now.
source: https://www.vox.com/2020/3/2/21161067/coronavirus-covid19-china      > I think the key learning from China is speed — it’s all about the speed. The faster you can find the cases, isolate the cases, and track their close contacts, the more successful you’re going to be. Another big takeaway is that even when you have substantial transmission with a lot of clusters — because people are looking at the situation in some countries now and going, “Oh, gosh, what can be done?” — what China demonstrates is if you settle down, roll up your sleeves, and begin that systematic work of case finding and contact tracing, you definitely can change the shape of the outbreak, take the heat out of it, and prevent a lot of people from getting sick and a lot of the most vulnerable from dying.
> What’s happening there that’s making things go back to normal from looking like a dystopian horror movie?  Forced quarantines and welding people's doors shut.
China semi-quarantined 700,000,000 people to stop it from spreading.
What's the turn around time from test to result?
I thought the whole reason you had to go through a physician is to cut back on the number of people getting tested
Cite a source or it never happened.
I was informed by a doctor that Dallas has tested 17k people for covid 19. We're still waiting for the results. There's already been 4 confirmed cases.
Gotcha.  Do we have a path to a sufficient testing regimen to detect 1k+ cases in NC?
Why not do that NOW? If we wait, it will be too late.
These details are very interesting, thanks for sharing.   ...but the Russian pencil reference: broken graphite + zero gravity + 1960s electronics= bad news.  But, I get the point.
Flu can totally cause pneumonia, though. Where did you see that it doesn’t?
you know that the Fisher company developed the space pen with their own money, not NASA, right?   Paul C. Fisher and his company, the Fisher Pen Company, reportedly invested $1 million to create what is now commonly known as the space pen. None of this investment money came from NASA's coffers--the agency only became involved after the pen was dreamed into existence. In 1965 Fisher patented a pen that could write upside-down, in frigid or roasting conditions (down to minus 50 degrees Fahrenheit or up to 400 degrees F), and even underwater or in other liquids.   https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/fact-or-fiction-nasa-spen/
This is what we need right now. If most people had a yes or no as to having the disease, then people would at least know if they need to isolate themselves.   https://www.geekwire.com/2020/report-amazon-gates-foundation-aim-team-scientists-home-test-kits-coronavirus/
well they're in south east sicily. The town they live in is 35k people but the hospital is basically just an Emergency room. The bigger town of Vittoria is about 70k and that's where my son was born. I myself went in once for a broken finger at 3pm, I was told the xray tech wasn't there and to come back the next day. I did and it was broken, then I had to go to another village to get the cast put on. I had shingles while I was there and after waiting from 7am at the emergency room I finally saw the dr. at 9pm. Apparently the room was the room that had a bathroom so there was all sorts of people coming in and out of my room the whole time while I was waiting for the Doctor.   The hospital my son was born at was FILTHY! I mean imagine old, dirt every where dirty. I have pictures that I can send to you, then when he was born you share the room with up to three other families. there were old piles of garbage that was seen from the windows all over the place, broken windows, and people too lazy to walk 100 feet to smoke so they stood In the window and smoked right where new born kids are. Shit when I went in to see my Doctor he had an ashtray on his desk and asked if I wanted to have a smoke with him.  Sicily is full of old stubborn folks and it's going to get bad if it makes it there
limited air transmission. much lower risk than being around someone coughing. there is no right answer here and very few people are in a position to not share air with anyone else.
You wrote a + sign, but from what ive seen most people are treating it as a ^ sign
i have 1.2 rolls of toilet paper :(
About 3-4 days of testing through LabCorp, from what I’ve read.
exactly why I said “You have to go through a physician and not go to a patient service center

4 cases in a city of 1.5million
I would imagine in part not quarantining now is because there is a need to balance people who can't work from home not having an income for long periods of time.
It can but it’s rare.
Ohhh gotcha: this makes sense for what I know about Italy HC system.   Silly southern me thought you were saying N. Italy is light-years ahead of "the South", as in southern USA :)   ...and generally I agree with your sentiment. USA has a health care, sanitation and population density advantage over China and Italy: we should be okay.
https://youtu.be/E3URhJx0NSw  Watch the first 20 minutes for sure. He discusses the vector of transmission at around minute 40. It is airborne and asymptomatic transmission  is occurring.    Asymptomatic means no coughing.  This is not just some ‘dude’ Rogan brought on. Michael Osterholm has had a very long career in the study of infectious diseases, and is recognized as an expert in his field.
So why are they trying to cut back on the number of people getting tested if there is no shortage?
So that press release says “we made a test” but nothing about mass availability.
I give it about two more weeks before everyone will freak out.
4 ***confirmed*** cases. Who have likely been spreading it for days, if not weeks.  How recently could you have said "4 cases in a country of 330 million lololol" and now we have over 1,000.
That doesn’t mean we can’t cancel festivals and large public gatherings.
>The flu is a common cause of pneumonia  [Source](https://www.healthline.com/health/influenza/facts-and-statistics#15)
yes, i have been self quarantining as much as possible (only going to work) for the past two weeks, as i am younger and the guilt over spreading this unknowingly was tearing me up. i have even been paying to have groceries delivered with VERY generous tipping. i wish others had this privilege, i know many people want to do the right thing and can't.
Why is who? You need to be specific
Testing by labs like LabCorp/Quest don’t require a kit.  They require a nurse/doctor to take a specimen, order the test, and send the specimen to the lab.  That’s it.
Some are getting cancelled: but, canceling those speaks to comment above. Most people who work those types of events need the income.
Whoever decided that you need to go through a physician. If they have enough tests why aren’t they testing everyone they can?
Am I reading a deleted comment? Am I replying to a deleted comment?
because if you have a flood of people going to a patient service center, those that are infected will spread COVID19 to a larger number of people than if they were to call their doctor, and tell them they had symptoms and wanted to be tested.   Those that don’t have it, may have the flu or other illnesses they’ll spread unnecessarily, or they may have had nothing, but catch something there.
They deleted their account, but comments stay un-deleted unless they are removed by you before you delete your account.   Technically you are replying to an un-deleted comment of a deleted person.
That makes sense. They should set up those drive through centers then to avoid the contact while still testing larger numbers

3 Duke Grad Students test positive for Coronavirus after being on an overseas trip

Note that there are additional students now in Durham with cough & fever awaiting test results
I guess that's why they want everyone to move out now.
Reading comprehension is key. These students aren’t in the US.
Typical Duke kids: thinking they are better and more important than the rest of us.     Edit: forgot the /s.
Everyone showing symptoms was on the trip and never came to campus, but yes, some people came home.
Yes but the rest of the group and it is likely they have symptoms or the virus

"Where are the tests?" - Coronavirus update from Sen. Jeff Jackson
&#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/5u47tylpsmm41.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=8125204a766a43801300272cd3044b1c82e1ea3aAs of March 14 at 8:00 a.m., the state of North Carolina has a total of 680 public (i.e., non-commercial) coronavirus test kits.So the big question is, “Why don’t we have more tests?”Here’s the situation:First, there’s a difference between “test kits” and “extraction kits.”Extraction kits = extract RNA (genetic material) from nasal swabs.Test kits = test RNA to see if it’s coronavirus.We started with a national shortage of test kits. That happened because the CDC - after rejecting the WHO kits and deciding to make their own - had a manufacturing error that allowed their test kit to produce false positives. So they had to start over several weeks in.To make matters worse, while the CDC was fixing their manufacturing error there were many other labs across the country (academic and commercial labs) that wanted to produce their own test kits. But they needed federal approval to move forward, and getting that approval took a couple weeks - a serious amount of time, given the prospect of exponential viral spread.It appears we are now seeing the production of test kits ramp up from both the CDC and commercial labs like LabCorp (which happens to be headquartered here in North Carolina).BUT that leads us to our second problem, and the current major bottleneck: extraction kits.Before you can test the RNA sample from the nasal swab, you have to extract it. Doing so requires a specific chemical. The majority of this specific chemical (called a reagent) is produced by one company with production facilities in Germany and Spain.And now that specific chemical is in very high demand. The whole world wants it.A few weeks ago, the FDA started allowing independent labs to develop alternate chemical processes for RNA extraction. It’s unclear how much progress has been made.So, looking now at the big picture, we basically have a two-track testing system: public testing, which involves our main state lab in NC using the re-manufactured CDC test kits (and in NC, we currently have 680 test kits) and then there’s commercial testing.Regarding commercial testing, we really don’t know how much is happening. The commercial labs aren’t required to disclose test results unless they’re positive. In North Carolina, we have LabCorp conducting commercial tests. In Charlotte, we also have our two major hospital systems - Atrium and Novant - now saying that they are going to provide “screening.” It’s unclear whether they are simply collecting swabs and sending them to LabCorp (where they may face the same extraction kit bottleneck) or whether they’ve developed in-house capacity to actually produce their own test results.But it’s important to note that BOTH public and commercial testing appear to be hitting a bottleneck when it comes to extraction.As a result, we are not screening nearly enough people.Ideally, anyone who displays flu-like symptoms would be eligible for a public test, free of charge. That’s how we would address this like South Korea and provide for wide-scale testing on the order of tens of thousands per day.But - due to the shortage - that’s not the case. Instead, the CDC guidelines (which NC is currently following) currently state that you have to 1) display flu-like symptoms AND have had direct contact with a confirmed COVID-19 case OR, 2) you have to display flu-like symptoms AND lower respiratory symptoms (cough, shortness of breath) AND a negative rapid flu test.A simpler way to say that is we are currently rationing public tests because we don’t have enough capacity.Congress is now providing more funding specifically for these issues and commercial labs are reportedly innovating rapidly, but this is essentially a race against time and increasing our testing capacity within the next ten days is absolutely critical. It’s also possible that the window of opportunity for containment - at least in some regions - is now closed and we’re going to have to rely heavily on social distancing to slow the rate of infection.You should also know that in the process of piecing this together I had many, many conversations with state and local health officials and every single one of them was on the same page, knew exactly what the bottlenecks were, and were working the problem. These folks get it, and they’re working around the clock for us.More updates soon.\- Jeff Jackson
Thank you for the clear explanation of the bottleneck, Senator. It's much appreciated!
Thanks for the very detailed information on the issues. It's great to understand why it's such an issue.
So a question-- if there is a global shortage of this chemical needed for extraction, how is it that other countries like Korea have managed to get enough to test many thousands of people? Did they just jump on it early while supplies were still available?
Thank you for taking the time to explain the issues here. It has been very confusing why the test were not available. I appreciate you giving a detailed response.
I appreciate this update and explanation so much!
Is there any way our university labs can work with other university labs who have innovated new kits recently — university of nebraska and others who have quicker tests? Or using the innovations university of washington made to get around the bottleneck? I see several states have drive thru testing now — is that coming here?
Excellent explanation of the test vs. extraction kits
If one is sick with flu-like symptoms that are probably the flu, what should they do? When does the benefit of getting tested override the risks of going to a healthcare facility?  Can you also speak some about social distancing and how NC will promote it?
u/JeffJacksonNC  I don't care about your political party at all. I love that you're here telling us what's going on with transparency. You've earned my trust as a new person to NC and I'm damn grateful that you're doing this.
You are awesome. Thank you so much for these posts.
Fuck the cdc
Jeff- read this and pass it along to others in charge. Thanks  https://medium.com/@tomaspueyo/coronavirus-act-today-or-people-will-die-f4d3d9cd99ca  Not sure why the downvote. Hope you take the time to read it. It's does a really good job explaining the situation and provides facts, figures, and models for corvid19.   🤷‍♂️
This is what happens when gov’t gets involved in healthcare. Delays, red tape, etc....and this is an emergency situation. Something to think about...
  When tests like this are developed it’s important that they are extremely specific in the reagents and equipment needed to perform them. This is to make sure that no matter what lab performs the test, any errors in results are not due to reagents. The current CDC tests rely on a specific brand (Qiagen) of RNA extraction kits, and that brand is hitting their production limit. There are other brands that are not yet in shortage, but they are not yet approved because their reliability has not been tested against the original kits.   Currently, Roche RNA extraction kits have also been approved for the test, so that will help alleviate the demand on Qiagen. But Roche is also having trouble keeping up. So as things progress, more brands will need to be evaluated and approved.  I don’t know what brand of kits South Korea and China used. It’s possible the testing in those countries used Qiagen, putting a demand on their supply before the U.S. began developing their kits at large scale.  Article explanation:  https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/rna-extraction-kits-for-covid-19-tests-are-in-short-supply-in-us-67250
Bioengineer here- there is a shortage of the one commercial kit that is called for in the CDC protocol to extract RNA (from Qiagen/ThermoFisher). Other countries and companies have other procedures that don’t use these specific RNA extraction kits. The stupid part is there are 20 other ways to extract RNA at a commercial scale, but none of them are really being utilized and the CDC hasn’t tried to adjust their protocols to accommodate the other ways (and these protocol tweaks are marginal .....)
If you have a fever of 100.4 and a cough or shortness of breath, you should go to your primary care physician and get a flu panel. Once the flu panel comes back negative, then you call the NC Dept of Public Health 24/7 Hotline and they refer you to where you can get tested.
I guarantee this is the work of like 5 assholes at the top, not the hundreds (thousands?) of dedicated scientists and health professionals who keep the org running
they've all been shaking trumps hand.  Bye cdc
It's what happens when a federal org has been constantly weakened and its leadership is afraid to contradict the boss
>This is what happens when gov’t gets involved in healthcare. Delays, red tape, etc....and this is an emergency situation.   Oh and things like this would never happen if the gov't was not involved? Doesn't that seem kinda idealistic?
This is what happens when half of society is addicted to lazy thinking and propaganda. Turn the Fox off dude, Fox said you can drink bleach to kill the virus. Maybe those are not smart people?
And I suppose private healthcare companies charging $40 per test kit would somehow be better...
Government agencies have no incentive to provide quality services. They have zero competition, and they get paid no matter how crappy of a job they do by stealing money from our paychecks.
Thanks, that's a great explanation!
Only $40? Seems like a deal.
$40 is awesome
You make it hard to argue
Btw that wasn't an insult
It would be $40,000 if they patented the process.

Wake County schools to close for at least 2 weeks after teacher tests positive for coronavirus

Someone predicted this in the thread about them not closing.

3/15 - Update on coronavirus cases and testing in NC - Sen. Jeff Jackson
 https://preview.redd.it/23gy5vsoavm41.jpg?width=820&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3fdccd8c453d177f24d922d6cb01cf5c08fca6a9As of March 15 at 11:00 a.m., North Carolina has 32 \*known\* cases of coronavirus.14 in Wake, four in Mecklenburg, two in Forsyth, two in Harnett, two in Johnston, one everywhere else.We went from seven known cases to 32 in five days.Safe to say we have more than 32 \*actual\* cases AND that no one has any idea how many we really have.BUT I've seen some moderate estimates that nationally we may have (very) roughly 15,000 cases - the bulk of which are in WA, CA, and NY.So perhaps NC is... in the hundreds?There are two issues with that prediction:\- The level of confidence in the underlying national prediction is low. Who knows if it's close to 15,000.\- The current level of cases isn't nearly as important as the rate of growth.We could have 50 cases or 200 cases in NC right now and if we see the growth rate of 6 days/double (the emerging national trend), then the starting point doesn't matter much.At that rate, it could still fill all our state's hospital beds within a matter of 8-10 weeks (depending on how long recovery takes).And that's assuming NC hospital beds don't have any other patients. Right now they're approximately 80% full. They're trying to reduce that number but it certainly won't get to 0%.**So the challenge is this:**Lower the rate of infection (through wider testing and social distancing) to lower the double rate to make sure we have beds for everyone who needs serious treatment.That's how we save the most lives.**UPDATE ON TESTING:**The state lab has tested 259 people.The main private lab, LabCorp, reportedly has capacity for 3,000 tests per day but we have no idea how many they've actually done.But don't get lost in the numbers. **Here's what really matters:**To qualify for a test you still need to meet criteria beyond simply displaying flu-like symptoms AND you still need a doctor's note. That limitation is what test rationing actually looks like in practice, and it's not good.Widespread, effective testing would look like this:Anyone with flu-like symptoms can drive up to a screening center (maybe a tent in the parking lot of a hospital or a Wal-Mart), getting a rapid flu test, and then if it comes back negative, getting a coronavirus test. That's what we need, A.S.A.P.BUT there has been significant progress in the last two days. Full update on testing progress coming tomorrow.Talk soon,Sen. Jeff Jackson
Man, I wish all politicians communicated this well. Thanks.
These daily updates are really helpful and grounding. Thank you so much!
I think I can speak on behalf of everyone when I say that we appreciate your candor, Senator.   Thanks for your continued efforts with this.
This is very much appreciated. Thank you Senator.
For those who want a scientific approach to calculating the number of infected in the US, I suggest watching this Khan Academy video.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCa0JXEwDEk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCa0JXEwDEk)  Edit: I wanted to thanks Sen Jackson for the information and his efforts in trying to get drive through testing up and running ASAP.
Some thoughts on number of cases and growth:  1) Not every case of CV19 requires hospitalization. The number of severe cases requiring hospitalization is more important than the total number of cases.  2) The total number of cases is anyone's guess because as mentioned not everyone who is infected needs to go to the hospital. The majority of those infected do not need to go to the hospital. There could be 1,000 people infected, at home, being sick for the next two weeks, who never go get tested and are never admitted into the hospital.  3) While it may be anyone's guess how many cases there are because no one is happy with the testing process and not everyone who is sick gets tested, it would be pretty easy for medical professionals to know how many severe cases requiring hospitalization there are even without a positive test. That's because there would be a sick person displaying all of the known symptoms in their hospital. Yes, they couldn't officially report it as a confirmed case without that positive test result, but if the virus was spreading out of control, threatening the lives of thousands, flooding our hospitals, we would know even without test results to show for it.  4) Keeping a close watch on the growth rate is extremely important, but the idea of exponential growth exploding out of control and completely overwhelming us depends on all variables remaining constant. However, there is an active, sustained effort to combat this illness and prevent its spread. Over the next 2-4 weeks the vast majority of people who can work from home will be, schools are shut down, large meetings/functions/gatherings are canceled, all major college and professional sports are shutdown/canceled, there is heightened awareness of personal hygiene, and there is around the clock work being done to find an effective vaccination. There are other efforts that can be implemented to further mitigate the disease in the weeks ahead.   5) Expect the worst, hope for the best, but remain calm and rational. Hyper-focusing on each new case and each new reported death is a very myopic approach to what is happening and causes us to lose sight of the fact that society may collapse some day due to some natural disaster beyond our control, but CV19 isn't it - not if we all do our part and focus on the bigger picture.
Thanks for communicating facts, Senator!
Thank you so much for being so transparent and keeping us all informed. I certainly will not forget this when it comes to voting. Please keep up the great work!
You effectively communicate.  You should not guess.
Right? I don’t know much about him but if he runs for anything statewide, I’m going to pay attention!
He's currently a State Senator out of Charlotte. I, too, hope he runs statewide and think he will/
With the census coming I feel we could end up with better representation in Washington, maybe, if we don't F-it up.

🏅Worst Article Written: Raleigh BC Target Employee Test Positive for Coronavirus

I went to this location today which elevates my frustration. What days did the employee work at the location? When was the "deep" cleaning done? Why the fuck did they not advice people entering the store today?
At this point you have to expect to be exposed any time you're in public. Between asymptomatic transmission and exponential spread, you can't rely on being warned.
There is a great chance you have been around many others already with the virus so it doesn't really matter. Depends more on what precautions you are taking to avoid exposure.
It sucks but you are so correct it’s sort like using universal precautions assume everyone has something you can catch!
Yes. You are right.
The price I might pay for some damn oreo cookies.
Hmmm I just happen to have made some homemade Oreos today!!
Homemade 😋 wow. Can you set some outside for me?
I’d be happy to! You can make them too, don’t be impressed I’m a lazy baker! Chocolate cake mix, two eggs, stick of butter. Portion into 24 balls, bake at 350 for 10 minutes. Stuffing 4oz cream cheese two cups of frosting sugar/powdered sugar, teaspoon of vanilla.

3/16 - Latest on the expansion of testing for coronavirus in NC - Sen. Jeff Jackson
 https://preview.redd.it/rtlzr3vzx3n41.jpg?width=940&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e7a440118de394090a775dc573b35b4b9a03f7ad**NC coronavirus numbers as of March 16*** 38 known cases (and 33 cases in SC) * No confirmed community spread (but nobody thinks it doesn’t exist)* One hospitalization* 369 people have been tested by the state (unknown number tested by non-state labs)* State currently has capacity for 1,300 more tests (unknown non-state capacity, but reportedly much higher)**Here’s the latest on the coronavirus testing situation in NC**There are two ways to get a test:1. A doctor decides you should have one and orders it from a commercial lab like LabCorp or from a hospital (UNC/Atrium/Novant) that has in-house testing capacity. These are "non-state" tests.2. Fever of at least 100.4 + negative flu result + *cough or shortness of breath* = you quality for a state lab test BUT a doctor still has to contact the county health department and get their permission AND we’re hearing about many cases where that permission is not being given due to scarce supply of state test kits.The immediate goal is expand testing capacity to the point where **EVERYONE who has fever + negative flu test + cough** can get tested.To see why that’s not currently happening, it helps to understand how the CDC supply chain works:* CDC sends test kits to the state* State distributes to counties* Counties release on a case-by-case basis as doctors call in**BUT*** CDC initially prioritized shipments to states that are getting slammed by coronavirus like WA and CA and NY, with states like NC only getting a small sliver.* Some counties are (reportedly) reluctant to release any test kits unless the patient has had direct contact with a COVID case - even if they meet the criteria of fever + negative flu test + cough. They are holding back for cases in which there has been direct contact with a COVID case out of a concern of lack of available tests and the need to prioritize. Some of this may have also been caused by confusion about the eligibility criteria, but fortunately the state COVID hotline - which had been overwhelmed - got extra capacity added today.But there's no question that some people who need to be tested have been turned away. Fixing that is the immediate priority.**To be clear: We need to very quickly get to a point where everyone with fever + negative flu test + cough can get tested.**So what are we doing to expand capacity?* Getting more test kits from the CDC* Partnering with LabCorp and other private vendors (so we’re not as dependent on the CDC for test kits)* Partnering with UNC Health Care, which just got federal approval to start testing today and is already setting up its first drive-thru testing center in Henderson County* Several non-state health care providers are expanding their own testing abilities, like Novant, Atrium, Tryon Medical Partners (which just found one of our state's 38 cases), and a clinic in Asheville. (If you know of more, please let me know! Tomorrow I'll publish a comprehensive list.)**Bottom-line:**It's hard to get a state lab test because they are being strictly rationed but the immediate goal is to have enough testing capacity to make sure that everyone who has a fever + negative flu test + cough can get tested.More soon,Sen. Jeff Jackson
Thank you for the continued detailed updates!
I feel like I've been following this extremely closely, and even so I learn much more about the local situation every time you post one of these.
Thanks for the update! Thank you for your hard work during these strange times!
Thanks bro, you're a real one with these updates
Thank you senator!
Thank you!!
Hi Senator Jackson, thanks for all of your great work! Given the test shortage and the wide range of symptoms, it seems likely that a lot of individuals will get and recover from COVID without ever knowing definitively that they had it. Do these tests detect patients who had COVID and recovered (and are therefore not at risk to get it again)?  It seems to me that reintegrating individuals once they are no longer at-risk will be a vitally important part of getting our communities back on track while at-risk individuals continue to practice social distancing.
Senator Jeff Jackson, have you and other representatives started dialogue on how we can have safe voting come November in the age of Coronavirus? I think it is pretty obvious we need better leadership starting at the top in Washington DC?
Seriously thank you for this!
Thank you, Senator!
Real leadership, at long last. Thank you!
Thank you for the updates and keeping us informed. I have a question that I haven't seen addressed - can the states accept tests from the WHO?
Thank, Jeff! These posts really help bring us together as a community- in understanding, in comfort, in taking this thing head on, and ultimately in moving forward.
u/JeffJacksonNC  ---  The current reasons given for test-kit bottleneck are:  * shortage of an RNA reagent compound, made by a German supplier   * shortage of appropriate nasal swabs    **Why are these shortages not a problem for South Korea, who sustaining a high testing throughput?**  Some say it's a supply chain issue, esp. b/c so many components are made in China, whose factories and logistics have been shut down or disrupted.   ---  [PolitiFact](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/mar/16/joe-biden/biden-falsely-says-trump-administration-rejected-w/) states this about WHO offering kits to the USA. (sources provided in PF article)   > * The WHO never offered to sell test kits to the United States.   > * Other developed countries with advanced research capabilities developed their own tests.   > * The CDC opted to develop its own coronavirus test and did not use the WHO’s protocol for the test.    **Thoughts?**
Is there any update on this? I woke up really sick this morning. My doctors office wouldn't pick up the phone, and none of the urgent cares will tell me if they have tests. If I can't get tested, I have to quarantine for weeks and could lose my job
That conversation is in the very early stages. We’re not even scheduled to be back in session until late April, so it’s going to be some time before you hear a plan for that.
Self-quarantine and keep trying to get tested.
[https://www.dukehealth.org/covid-19-update](https://www.dukehealth.org/covid-19-update)  &#x200B;  My doctor told me that the Duke hotline can schedule a test, though I don't need one yet (I may within 24 hours).  He said that they're building capacity for testing, but it's a much faster turnaround than going to a doctors' office.  Fair warning: I haven't tried calling yet.
Thanks for this. Just fyi- the Duke hotline does nothing but forward you to your primary doctors office and   told me the same garbage about needing a fever over 101 to qualify for a test. Which is so stupid because 20% of cases are asymptomatic and 40% of cases do not have high fever. I have a sore throat, cough, chills, and a 95.8 fever...  I'm not allowed to go back to work until I get tested, and I have friends in other states who got tested just for saying they felt sick... so what the hell NC??
99.8* sorry haha

PRO TIP: If you are having trouble finding food items at HT, Whole Foods etc... try world markets. I went to the Halaal market yesterday.  on W. Chapel Hill St. across from the Co-op and they had plenty of food including fresh meats. I will say they don’t have an abundant selection of fresh veggies but overall they had an adequate amount of food.
Per [this N&O article](https://www.newsobserver.com/news/coronavirus/article241228151.html) Duke will have drive through Coronavirus testing on its campus starting Tuesday, you’ll need a Dr.’s prescription to be eligible.
Yesterday I was talking with my therapist via telephone, and I asked her if this was all really necessary and is it as bad as the media is making it out to be? She responded with “Yes, its a dangerous situation.” She told me that she is in self-quarantine because a work colleague has been infected. She also told me that hospitals are only testing those who are high-risk because they don’t have enough tests for everyone. She said that she has friends who work in local hospitals and her parents, who are doctors, have reported the same thing. She said that it is very serious. I just wanted to post this PSA for anyone who may be having doubts about whether all of these precautions are necessary. Let’s try to stay healthy, people.
Can we all be good neighbors, and post to this thread or page when someone is finally able to find some toilet paper?

I live in North Durham and started having flu like symptoms on Saturday, called the doctor they had me come in today.  Tested negative for the flu and they gave me the COVID-19 test it will be four days until results come in.    As a note I work from home normally and before I was sick our family was already staying at home.  My only outside trips in the last two weeks have been to the grocery store twice where I wiped down the cart and washed my hands after as well as one hike around west point on the Eno to get my 4 year old out of the house for a little bit.   I will keep you updated.
I’ve noticed that a few of the cliques in my neighborhood are still hanging out in pretty close proximity on a daily basis and their kids from 4 different households are still physically playing with one another. Are you seeing the same behavior in your hood?
Visited the Art Museum park this weekend. Sadly the 2 meter rule for distancing suggested by Drs and scientists is difficult to maintain especially when you have the cute pets. The weather was nice and the kids and young adults are off school. I think this will be trend moving forward. A friend visiting umstead park this weekend also shared similar experience. The place I felt most at ease was walking in downtown durham which was like a ghost town on Sunday. Just wanted to throw that out there if you are vulnerable and want to get out.

If anyone is having issues finding toilet paper, Compare Foods on University Drive has tons! We were at Costco first but they’re out today (May 19) and said there are no specific dates for restock or shipments, it’s pretty random for them.  Compare Foods also had a sign at the register saying they had K95 masks for sale (both single masks and bundles). We didn’t ask if they currently had any in stock, but it’s worth a shot if you’re looking for masks!
Anyone know someone making masks? Would love to purchase some for myself and my fiancé. We are using t-shirts right now.
Why does the City and County of Durham have a different stay at home order than the State? I'm sure there's a reason, just tell me.
So I found a free class on coronavirus on Coursera. Prof dude Neil Ferguson said "Might be worth just saying that every time we detect a death, there's probably a thousand undetected cases behind that death" So if we have 3 deaths that means the our number is actually 3000 and not 749 (march 27). Oh boy.
Daycare still seems open. Surprising?

 Any update on a shelter in place order??
Not to scare anybody or anything, but was there really anything about a fly-by drop for tonight around 11:30pm? I would have said something earlier, but I'm at work (Duke Hospital, technically an office building, so not scrub viewing...). My mom said there was some kind of spray drop or something tonight, but I don't know where she get's her sources from.
How have the grocery stores been? I'm immuno compromised and need to get food within the next week or so but I'm nervous to go out there if they've been slammed busy and out of everything.
Hutchins Garage has been doing pick up pizzas every day for the past week and a half from 4pm-9pm. Menu changes daily as some ingredients are harder to come by. Menus posted daily on Facebook and Instagram.
Having trouble finding TP. When (day and time) and where have you had success finding?
Can we stick something on here directed at helping healthcare/essential workers? Links to donation sites / volunteers / childcare providers / doing meal prep for people working overtime risking their own health / making homemade masks for non-healthcare essential workers, stuff like that as it pops up?
I wish there was a way to know which restaurants really need people to order from them. I know the popular ones (lots of reviews on Yelp) usually get continued patrons but I feel bad for the smaller, less popular ones.
The article says there will eventually be 3 Durham county locations.  I can't seem to find any info on Duke website, though.
I'm more concerned that you didn't know it was necessary prior to talking to your therapist
How prevalent, if at all, is the reopen NC thing up that way? Live in Wilmington and our sub has gotten a decent bit of posts about it, and Carolina Beach recently had a small event, with another one apparently scheduled for Wilmington. I think it's mostly astroturfed by Koch and similar orgs but we also have a good deal of stupidity/chudish behavior here compared to Durham.
Update -- just picked up TP at Costco today. Good luck!
Could have been your child at daycare or partner if you have one that got you sick. Good lesson for us all though.
Hey bud, how you feeling? Checking in. ❤️
Scary. Good luck and hope you feel better soon.
No, I'm not, the parents in our neighborhood are being pretty strict about distancing. Honestly, if this goes on past April, I think we may be joining those parents in at least allowing our kids to play with our neighbors. This shit is hard to do with preschoolers, and if both families are in strict quarantine other than with each other, it seems relatively safe to allow.

The same reason states have different orders than each other. Local governments can be more strict if they choose to be, as long as its constitutional.
I wonder if it's possible they are self isolating together? They could all be from those apartments there. I'm not saying I have any doubt how dumb and unsafe people are, but there's a chance.
We pulled our children from theirs on Friday. They're officially suspending operations tomorrow. They wanted to give families two days to make arrangements as they gave the notice on Monday morning. Most don't follow the school systems.

Compare Foods at Forest Hills had a LOT today. The shelves were full, and they had it stacked on top of the freezers. It’s only available in 4-packs, and it’s a Latino brand. It looked good quality, though. I would wipe with it! :-)  I was there at 2pm today (Thursday). They also had paper towels, but not a lot of them.
Sure, post links and I'll update
I work in restaurants. In my opinion, you shouldn't be eating at restaurants right now. If you must, you should be eating food from places that have demonstrated concern for employee health, and allow you to payment/pickup/drop off with no face to face contact.  The places with more responsible ownership have already temporarily closed or are  closing. You can support the ones that are closed by buying a gift card.
Pretty much the last holdouts are coming out of denial, the sooner everyone knows and takes the right measures the sooner this is over with.
Can you send Sancho with some ASAP!
The only issue is that you can’t fully trust where those other people are going during the day and who they come in contact with.
Now all of a sudden everyone is a runner lol
So we have the following Guidelines...   \- World Health Organization   \- CDC Guidelines  \- State of North Carolina Guidelines  \- City of Durham Guidelines
I think it was false. My mom told me about it, but she got it from a video on Facebook. It was maybe a month ago, but I'm sure it was a trolling asshole.
🤦🏻‍♀️ shit my bad. Thanks for the link!

I wasn’t in denial. I really just wanted some info verified by a source other than the media. She is an educated person whom I trust, so her info was important for me.
Sancho is on his way! We all know you get by with a little help from your friends.
Yeah, I mean I guess you have to take some small risk that your best friends aren't liars, but that's a risk I'll take. I don't expect other parents to be reckless with their quarantine, especially not parents that we are best friends with. Assuming they are taking it as seriously as us, then there is basically no risk as we are both 0% risk for the virus.   This is all hypothetical btw, we are not doing this, I think we would only do this if the quarantine runs into May or comes back in the Fall. There is only so much you can ask of preschoolers, they need activity, exercise and interaction at some point.
There's a difference between a guideline and an order. We only have two orders, state and local. State sets the minimum requirements, local chooses to follow it or go beyond it. CDC/WHO guidelines are like a wishlist, what they think is best, but they are not orders. Pretty simple really.
Hey there, did you get what you needed from the store?  If not, I can go get groceries for you, if you want me to. (I’m not a service, just a person looking to help.) Message me if you would like help.
Added, thanks!
I'm not directing this at you, but there are still a lot of people are still in denial that this is a thing and will change the day-to-day of their lives. If you made this realization 7 days ago, you were ahead of most people.
I’m not saying that your best friends aren’t honest, I’m saying that if on any given day they happen to be exposed to the virus inadvertently and then bring it back to the hood, you run the risk of families passing it along to each other. If you keep the virus isolated in one household at least you aren’t spreading it to others.
Wow thank you so much for offering! I ended up going first thing Monday morning and it wasn't too busy thankfully. I got enough for 2 weeks so I'm set for now but I really appreciate your offer :)

Yeah, I get that, that's the whole point of the quarantine, and I agree that we shouldn't be doing that. I'm just saying at some point the tiny of risk of what you are describing becomes worth it to have at least one other family with kids for ours to interact with. It would be a calculated risk and we would still quarantine from the rest of the world.
Hooray!
Since this will likely extend past 2 weeks, know that Targets reserve the first business hour 7-8am, for immune compromised shopping, Tuesdays and Wednesdays. Please take care :)

15 people affiliated with Duke test positive for coronavirus

Just so people are aware: Duke has transitioned to all online coursework. They have also made the entire medical campus card access only (meaning they can track people coming in and out of buildings) and are screening people coming in and out of the hospital at public entrances. Lastly, research labs are being transitioned to only essential personnel, meaning most graduate students and laboratory employees will be working from home until directed otherwise. Duke does present a risk of spread given how many people it employs and trains, but they’re doing what they can to mitigate it. I hope this helps.
When discussing Duke. It makes sense to explain which part of Duke. As they are a large entity. Hospitals, MOB, Schools, Energy Production.....Be specific when giving information to combat misinformation.
Why does the CDC have the number of Covid-19 cases in Durham county at only 1 person as of midnight March 18th?  Are they not being counted to our total for some reason?  Or, is this report bullshit?
Reports on Next-door suggest one of these students was out on Ninth Street just yesterday which seems to match earlier reports these students were not self quarantined prior to this announcement.
So can anyone confirm or deny that any of these folks live in a popular duke student condo neighborhood off of moreene rd?  Just asking cause my work thinks since I don’t “really have to interact” with ppl I can work as normal, but this is a community I might would have to work in—so it kinda proves my point that it’s bs that the office folks can work from home to “avoid exposure” but fuck me right.
Duke is high risk right now. Their community overall travel  a bit domestically and internationally.
yes the only concern is where these people were before being tested in NC
Duke PA students are still continuing clinical rotations though other local schools have been suspended. Any word on whether this will change?
CDC is not updating its info regularly and is only selectively updating. Keep track of the spread with Johns Hopkins COVID-19 map & Covid Tracking Project on Twitter.
CD stopped updating their website with current numbers a couple weeks ago.
I really don’t want to push rumors but I was somewhere on ninth street and overheard a vendor say they had a Duke student in earlier who was in the group that tested positive  Covid-19 earlier. Definitely not under quarantine. Also, can anyone confirm that these are MBAs at Fuqua who were abroad for some trip?
“Reports from Next-Door”
Its time to name and shame. Fuck these assholes.
https://www.dukechronicle.com/article/2020/03/duke-university-coronavirus-durham-classes-canceled-basketball-covid19-live-blog  Station Nine
demilitarized zone?
Not really any more than every other college across the country. All of the people they're talking about have been quarantined and weren't wandering around campus
I am not happy about this by any means just trying to warn folks🙏
They were self quarantined as they knew shortly after returning that people on their trip tested positive. However, that is not to say that there wasn’t spread regardless.
I know one of them. They were returning from Israel.
It just changed right now.  All PA students should check their In-Boxes.
Not quite the answer you are looking for, but earlier this week Dukes PT program said all students at clinicals outside of Duke Med were done at the end of the week, and just today announced the same for students in Duke Med placements.
I don’t know, sorry.
No.   https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fcases-in-us.html  NC dept of health and human services updates everyday at 11am est.

> **I really don’t want to push rumors** but I was somewhere on ninth street and overheard a vendor...
Three of the first four (who are still abroad) were fuqua students, that much has been confirmed by fuqua. It stands to reason that most or all of the other 15 were as well, but Duke is being deliberately vague.    https://www.dukechronicle.com/article/2020/03/duke-university-graduate-students-test-positive-coronavirus-outside-united-states
>I really don’t want to push rumors  Really? Then fucking don't.
What day?? I was there Friday and the lines were long with no way to stand 6 more than 6 feet apart. Today my body aches and I have a low grade fever.
Yes, let's have "justice by doxxing" in reddit comments about Next Door posts. What could possibly go wrong?
reads to me like the group at station nine is distinct from the group of Fuqua students
Wide open.
Weren't there two people on the trip that went to a local bar in Durham when they got back? I saw that post a few days ago.
All the people were told to self quarantine. Doesn’t seem like duke took appropriate measures to quarantine them. They have plenty of funds and could have. But allowing them home and then the institution and state/county board of health not enforcing a quarantine is the spike in the end zone... maybe someone just said too little, too late?  That said, one of the weaknesses this crisis has exposed is the failings of communications and policy across Federal, State and Local institutions.
I also know one of them, a good family friend of mine and they don’t believe they caught it in Israel, rather at the airport on a layover
When this first started amping up the CDC's website was not updating to purposely keep the numbers low. things have since changed.
That’s really unnecessary - if you look at this thread many comments are of that flavor. For some reason you took issue with mine specifically for being clearer and precise.
Jesus. I wish I were surprised, but I'm really not.
Do you know where this layover was?
Why would duke put out an official statement that they had to stay and receive treatment in IS then?
I took issue because you prefaced spreading a rumor with a statement saying you didn't want to do just that. Maybe a bit harsh, sorry, but I don't think the statement helps anything.
Thanks! I guess that doesn’t rule out one of them (or a contact) being there Friday, but it does help me relax a little
I’m not sure honestly, I’ll go ahead and ask. But my friend is pretty sure it was there because Israel doesn’t have any confirmed community spread and is on complete lock down
I haven’t seen that! But again, my family friend said those people started feeling sick soon after they arrived there and given the incubation, they don’t think they caught it there.

Senator Dumped Up to $1.6 Million of Stock After Reassuring Public About Coronavirus Preparedness - Richard Burr, N.C.
[https://www.propublica.org/article/senator-dumped-up-to-1-6-million-of-stock-after-reassuring-public-about-coronavirus-preparedness](https://www.propublica.org/article/senator-dumped-up-to-1-6-million-of-stock-after-reassuring-public-about-coronavirus-preparedness) This is who our elected official is - who we trust to provide us accurate information and assure us for the good of the people. WTactualF.
Friday Plans, *social distancing style*:  **CALL BURR’S OFFICE**  *repeat*
The fact that I’m not surprised is bumming me out.  Yet another reason to seriously dislike that guy.
Please tell me the IRS or SOMEONE is gonna nail this fucker. And all the other pieces of shit who did the same.
(202) 224-3154 That's his DC office number. Flood the switch board.  He doesn't represent us, he only cares about the donor class. Thats who he thinks his constituents are.  SHAME He's failed as a leader and is a disgrace of a man. Demand he resign
The North Carolina Republican Party is so dreadfully corrupt. Whether it's the gerrymandering, brazen parliamentary maneuvers, or shit like this, they're just dreadful across the board.
I guess I thought corrupt politicians making a profit off of the pandemic wouldn't start this quickly.
Unfortunately, it seems 3 or 4 other senators have been proven (keyword proven) to have done the exact same thing. Including Feinstein
I unloaded all my stocks then. The news was heavily reporting on it, and if you even slightly researched deeper, you could tell this was spreading in an unprecedented way. And then the Asian markets crashed. If you were paying attention, you either sold and moved to a safer investment, or have the strategy to stick it out for the long run. No one should have been blindsided by this crash. Selling to protect your assets is not insider trading, when the rest of us did it without needing to be on the senate intel committee   I don’t like Burr for many reasons. But I’d be a hypocrite for getting mad for this.
He can't exactly say "we're all screwed people, sell it now", right? He'd be crucified.  People are easily duped. You don't listen to politicians, and you absolutely don't listen to their reassurances in a crisis. They can never be seen as negative, even if they are telling the absolute truth. If politicians or mainstream media is saying "no need to panic", that's your signal to do the opposite of what they're telling you to do.  For example, CNN just posted an article saying there's no reason to withdraw cash from your bank account. That's your signal to do it. You have every reason to do it- It's your money and there's a chance cash will become scarce and you won't be able to get it later. There's no penalty for getting some now. A rational person should be withdrawing at least some. Besides, what kind of banking system can't handle people wanting their own money? A fucked system that may be on its last legs. Don't go down with the ship. Protect yourself. Do as Senator Burr does, not as he says.  Edit: downvote all you like for your precious virtue signaling. But please secretly protect yourself.
https://www.burr.senate.gov/contact/office-locations
I called every single one of his offices. I didn’t get a person anywhere, and only one of the offices had an open voicemail box. Keep telling him what a scummy dirtbag he is!
Couldn’t agree more. The fact that he’s the chair of the Intelligence Committee, however, strips all benefit of the doubt that this is his first time doing this.
The other Senator who is tied up in this is Kelly Loeffler, junior Senator from Georgia appointed by the governor in January.   She is reported to be the wealthiest Senator at an estimated $500million between she and her husband, who is, get this, a chairman on the ***New York Stock Exchange***.  They are both going down for this.
For someone his age, this isn’t a giant nest egg.
If you save 7% in a 401(k) from 20-65 you ought to have a higher net worth than that.  Don't forget to count house, etc in net worth.  A businessman/politician having only $1.7m net worth is very surprising to me.  I would expect it to be a lot higher.  A lot of these people have houses that are worth $1m plus alone.  I found an old list of net worth for congress members here [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_current\_members\_of\_the\_United\_States\_Congress\_by\_wealth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_current_members_of_the_United_States_Congress_by_wealth).
FYI at his age/occupation... 1.7 million net worth is LOW. Retirement can deplete 1.7 quickly. TRUST THAT.
Unfortunately it’s not just NC
You didn’t have security briefings about how bad things were going to get, shared that Intel with donors/special constituents but stayed silent or optimistic in public commentary while selling your stock.    [Also, it’s not explicitly illegal for you to do it.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/STOCK_Act)  Don’t feel hypocritical. We hold our congress members to higher standards, for good reason.
It's not *just* that he dumped his stocks - it's that he didn't do jack shit with his position to do anything for the public. If he's privately acting like this shit is real, but publicly complacent, it's clearly highly unethical. It's plenty reason to think him a shitbag, on top of the pile that he'd already built - going back to being one of only 3 voting against the STOCK act that addressed this very issue.
I didn't sell, but I'm fairly young.  If I was close to retirement I think I would have.  The writing was very clearly on the wall and I know several people who unloaded.  I don't think our government had any inside information, and the crappy response seems to indicate the info they had sucked.
A run on the banks is known to exacerbate financial crises and may have caused the Great Depression. It's rational to want to "save your money," but banks are FDIC backed and unless you exceed the insurance limit, your money is fine. While it may seem rational, but it is actually self-defeating as it causes even greater stress on the financial system and worsens the economic downturn.
Senator Burr is ostensibly a servant of the people. I mean he's clearly not. But he's been outed for undeniably bad behavior, and he needs to resign.
He did it in 2008, too.
There are 4 of them identified now.  The other 2 are Inhofe and Feinstein. Inhofe was 1 of the 8 who voted against the relief package, so in screw him in an especially uncomfortable way.
Is it HER wealth, HER husband, HER occupation, or that it’s a wealthy WOMAN you have problems with??  I’m confused because other senators (and ordinary citizens) made transactions too, as part of financial management practices until proven otherwise.  Senator Loeffler, I’m guessing wouldn’t risk her entire net worth and reputation on a relatively small transaction. And certainly HER husband wouldn’t risk his career. 🤷‍♀️It just doesn’t make sense when looking from this perspective.
He's not retiring, bud. He's extremely likely to go into lobbying. Or take up more speaking engagements. Or both. So I wouldn't worry, he's going to be just fine with his "only" 1.7 million dollars in the bank right now.   Poor Richard Burr. He could only make a small profit off his elected position. /s
Precisely. Can’t fault anyone who used public info to make a personal decision.   I didn’t sell anything because I’m basically halfway between career start and retirement, and I have an aggressive investment strategy. I’m betting on things turning around and am trying to figure out the best time to put in more money. That’s not a good strategy for everyone, including the people Burr’s age.  However, this reeks of insider trading and particularly that of the STOCK Act-violating variety. Given that Martha freaking Stewart got prosecuted for insider trading, they sure as hell should. Especially Burr, who mainly ditched travel-related stocks, and Loeffler, who bought a ton of shares of a company that specializes in telecommuting tech.
Im very young and sold, and now I’m buying a house with near 0% interest mortgage. It worked out pretty well for me.
Exactly.   Look at the TP situation... when people buy a reasonable amount, even taking the crisis into amount, there is still enough for others. But when a few people freak out and hoard insane amounts of it, the supply and demand system breaks down.   Cash is not TP, but you can still see a similar scenario: when everyone freaks and pulls a whole bunch of money out, the system suffers. Take out cash to have on hand to ensure your safety in this crisis, yes. But we shouldn’t make runs on banks, demanding tons and tons of cash. As @Vamppotbellygoblin noted, that often makes a financial crisis worse.
Listen to what you're saying. The system is broken. It doesn't have to be this way. If a bank run is even a possibility, obviously reserve requirements were too lac. Think about who benefits from those loose policies..
None of them are.  His replacement went be, either. They're all just trying to say what you want to hear.
https://www.thedailybeast.com/sen-kelly-loeffler-dumped-millions-in-stock-after-coronavirus-briefing  You do not get a free pass for misleading the American people, violating ethics, and profiteering with insider knowledge of a pandemic because you are a woman. This politician saw this coming and still misled the public, you would have to be fucking crazy to defend this.
Just stop with your agrandizing bullshit.   This has nothing to do with her being a woman and everything to do with her being a corrupt piece of shit.   The conflicts of interest of her being on the  Joint Economic Committee while being married to someone with considerable influence in the New York Stock Exchange is baffling.   She wasn't elected. She was appointed by another corrupt piece of shit, Brian Kemp (who most likely manipulated the elections in Georgia as Secretary of State to win the Governorship). She has no mandate from the people to legislate. She is there to cash in and get out.   This was the first stock transaction that she undertook while in office and it likely set her up to save millions from the fallout. To speculate that she wouldn't "risk" her wealth over trying to obtain more wealth just shows how little you have been paying attention to the vaste power and wealth consolidation that is plaguing our entire planet.
Aweee my apologies to you and your vast knowledge of how this world works... you are SO MUCH SMARTER THAN ME...now go toke your bong, play your video games and talk about how smart you are on Reddit 🖕

North Carolina coronavirus cases rise above 250, as hospitals restrict visitors

Uh, does this mean if your spouse goes into the ER and is admitted....they go alone?
>	For UNC, no visitors will be allowed at inpatient areas at UNC Medical Center, UNC REX, Chatham Hospital, UNC Hillsborough and Johnston Health. The exceptions are one visitor for: a pediatric patient, partner of a laboring mother, Emergency Department companion, outpatient area companion, in-person discharge instructions and 24 hours following a surgery or invasive procedure.  >For Duke, starting Monday, no visitors will be allowed into Duke University Hospital, Duke Regional Hospital and Duke Raleigh Hospital until further notice. The exceptions are: patients nearing end of life or on hospice, patients who are children (one visitor), patients in the labor and delivery unit (one visitor), and patients being discharged from the hospital (one visitor). Patients and visitors who meet the exceptions will be screened before they can enter the Duke Health facilities.  >	All WakeMed facilities will also limit visitors starting Monday. Exceptions are for the following circumstances, and all for just one support person or visitor: pediatric patients, partner or doula of a laboring or postpartum mother, Emergency Department patients, outpatient/physician practice locations (though patients are strongly encouraged to come alone if they are able), when in-person discharge instructions are being given and 24 hours following a surgery or invasive procedure. WakeMed will also make exceptions for end-of-life situations on a case-by-case basis.  I’m pasting the guidelines from the article for Duke, Unc, and Wakemed because trying to read that article was honestly pretty terrible. It’s like two lines of text, followed by huge ads.
I'll answer your query with a quote, from someone I never thought I would be quoting:  &#x200B;  >People are in a small apartment, they're in a house, they're worried, they're anxious. Just be mindful of that. Those three word sentences can make all the difference. I miss you, I love you, I'm thinking of you, I wish I was there with you, I'm sorry you're going through this, I'm sorry we're going through this.    >   >My last point is, practice humanity. We don't talk about practicing humanity. But now, if ever there's a time to practice humanity, the time is now. The time is now to show some kindness. Show some compassion to people. Show some gentility. And this is a time for a little gentility. It's a time for a smile when you're walking past someone. It's a time for a nod. It's a time to say hello. It's a time for patience. And don't let the little things get you annoyed.    >   >Yes, we have a problem. Yes, we will deal with it. Yes, we will overcome it. But let's find our better selves in doing it.

Coronavirus NC updates: At least 636 cases of COVID-19 reported in NC and Stay At Home Orders


Durham public school closed March 16 - corona virus
Starting March 16 Durham public schools will be closed.
The big question:  What will working people do with their kids? Will jobs excuse their absences? What about part time employees who have to miss work to stay home with their kids and don’t have accrued time off? So many people live paycheck to paycheck...  I work in management. I feel for how this will affect a lot of my employees.
We are hoping if wake closes that pay checks will continue and possibly make time up at a later time...not sure what we will do if not.
We're checking with our daycare provider right now, to see if they're still open, we can send our other kid for $50 a day, so a few weeks of closure will cost us a few hundred.  Edit: They advised us that they were going to follow government guidelines, and they would stay open until it was recommended they close. So that's a relief right now.
For daycare participants, this gets very difficult. You’re needing someone to stay at home with kids, while not working to earn money and still paying daycare for the time that they’re not using for care.  Additionally, if you have a kid at home, how m h fun is it going to be to entertain them while controlling for their contact with other germs? At school they have consistent contact with the same people, but now going to parks or other public places during that day will create a larger spread.
one idea i have heard other areas doing is to get a group of 5 families together and each take 1 day/wk off and take turns caring for each others' kids.
It would have been great if Republicans didn't shoot down the COVID family assistance bill that was proposed this week.
I see older high school juniors and seniors posting on Nextdoor in my area looking for babysitting/summertime childcare gigs pretty frequently. If properly vetted, they might be a workable solution for some families.
It would be great if they didn't attach all the unrelated pork along with it.

How to support small local businesses hurt by corona virus outbreak.

I work at a local print shop that does a lot of printing for duke events, they have haulted all printing. The same goes for some of our nation wide accounts. We layed of 25% of our workforce on wednesday.
I work in catering and literally all of our events have been called off. The repercussions of this reaction are going to leave folks in ruins.
Generously tip your service staff.  Also, if you are ordering takeout/delivery, please give added consideration to local, non-chain restaurants. Their financial condition is usually much more precarious than a chain restaurant.
Things will have done anything but settle down in a month or two.  We haven’t even begun to really feel the pain yet.  Infections are going to be much more widespread in a couple of months.  At best, you may be helping by buying gift cards.  But, know that it’s entirely possible that you’re throwing your money into a fire by buying a gift card that may never be redeemable if the business does close.
It would be cool if we could get some data from local restaurants on if/how they are hurting and what would help. Are people already staying away from restaurants around here? Because if so, the worst is yet to come and it would be helpful to triage the help.
The problem is that people need money to support small businesses. Relying on individuals to prop up sectors using their wages right now isn't reliable. I won't get into politics here, but if we could ensure basic needs were met *then maybe people would actually have the means to support small businesses*
I passed this along on Facebook.  I'm a small business owner. My company won't be hurt but I'm certainly concerned for others. I will be buying gift cards!!
Are they shutting down for a short period? I was planning on getting takeout tonight...
We rent part of our house on Airbnb to help with raising property taxes etc. Cancellations left and right, all guests getting full refunds. Everyone is going to hurt from this. Except the private sector companies that Trump brought in to try to patch up the problems he created. They're going to make billions.
That is so awful.
Yo fellow print people. Lost all out duke jobs, full frame, even church congregation bulletins because of entire church services were canceled. It's not just retail and restaurants that are hurting.
Man I totally feel you but it's a catch 22. Either we proceed with all planned events and then those who are in high risk populations get severely ill and/or die or we try to prevent as much transmission as possible. There are no winners here and you're right, the effect will be seen for months if not years. It's just unfortunately a really shitty circumstance.
Yes this is scary.  Most live paycheck to paycheck.  From my experience in service many folks shift to shift.  A bad shift could really throwoff plans.  It can be very hard to save.  If I am out I will tip all I can.  We are all summer children.  Winter is coming.
Same man. Same. Literally every event for the next 6 weeks has been cancelled. Shit is rough.
true, but everyone who works there is local
As someone in the industry, yes, people are staying away from restaurants. It's pretty universal from what I hear. I think larger establishments (i.e. places with larger, roomier spaces) are suffering more than intimate restaurants. Something about being in a big room full of people is a big turn-off.  Everyone is suffering. Support your favorite local restaurants—they will remember it.
It's reasonable to assume that people are going to shy away from restaurants. I've been hearing anecdotal statements that Asian spots are getting hit hard already. Went to see The VVitch at Alamo last week, and less than half the seats were filled and it was a near sold out show.
I think this would depend on the restaurant and location. A friend of mine owns a restaurant in Morrisville, and I went yesterday for dinner to meet up with him about some work I do for one of his other businesses. The dinner crowd didn't seem too bad, but he said business is way down, and him and his partner are already considering having to lay off staff and perhaps move to takeout only. Many restaurants in Morrisville/RTP area rely on the lunch crowd for most of their business. But since many of the companies in the area are encouraging or forcing work from home (the effect of which is already greatly evident in traffic), his main income stream has been decimated.   For other establishments whose customer base is more locally residential, I'd imagine they'd be less likely to have long-term effects as some people get tired of cooking or being cooped up in their houses and decide to go out to eat in lieu of other entertainment.
Here's an article from the N&O on restaurants losing business and what they are doing. It's still anecdotal evidence, but interesting.   [https://www.newsobserver.com/living/food-drink/article241160291.html](https://www.newsobserver.com/living/food-drink/article241160291.html)
I don't know if people are staying away from restaurants yet. However, depending on the area, some may rely for a portion of the sales on local events/conferences that have been cancelled.  Also, with Universities cancelling classes and keeping them off campus, businesses that depend on student sales could be hurting. If there is a significant outbreak in our area, then people might stop going out. It's something to consider and keep an eye on. The local sales data will come later.
I had lunch at NuvoTaco today and the line was to the door at 12:30 (as usual). They were taking extra precautions, like not having the salsa bar open and having individually wrapped plasticware. Thy had put up hand sanitizers, too.
I haven't heard any reports of that yet.
Restaurants are generally going to stay open, because they still need to be making money. But they're getting a lot less business for obvious reasons.
I don’t blame anyone for shutting stuff down. This is unprecedented and I believe everyone is doing the best they can. I just worry for myself and people even worse off.
Shift to shift yes. $100-300 a shift. 800-1k rent plus life. The math ain’t good.
I just saw NY landlords are withholding evictions for next 3 months. I think everyone will follow this.
I like the idea of supporting restaurants when things happen to give them low business, but eating out is bad practice in when social distancing is one of the best things we can do to control the spread. Because even if I don't get it, I can easily travel between people who do
Yeah, that's fair. I guess why I'm interested in knowing specifically who needs help is because I rarely order food from restaurants, but I'd buy a gift card or lunch/dinner at a place I knew was struggling.
Good points.   What is your friend's restaurant?
NuvoTaco was specifically mentioned in this article:   [https://www.newsobserver.com/living/food-drink/article241160291.html](https://www.newsobserver.com/living/food-drink/article241160291.html)
Yeah I agree, its just a not good situation and as someone also in service it sucks to see all my friends suffering.
Thanks for posting!  I did notice people taking out orders, but it was hard to tell if it was more than usual. I was glad to see so many people eating there and to see that they had put in some new preventive measures.   I don’t eat out very often, but when I do, it’s always little spots like NuvoTaco, Foster’s Market, Grub, Nosh, etc., so I sure hope we all can help them stay afloat.
