UPDATE: State confirms first COVID-19 community spread case in Wilson County; 2nd case identified in Craven County

Probably because they're keeping Cherry Point open and operating.
I'm in Onslow. Since our only confirmed case is on Lejeune, the county is pretending like everything is fine. Everything is open. Very few precautions taken. Very disappointed in our leaders.
Our whole area has shut down, schools, restaurants, everything. But the base is open so there's really no point, they're going to infect everyone out in town.
Yeah I saw that Craven had a second case. Try to stay safe.
