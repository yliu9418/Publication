Wake County: Person return Washington State (Nursing Home) COVID-19 (Flew-In to RDU February 22)
"COVID-19 Male NC #1" refuses to be self-identified, or identified by both the airline and NC public health authorities. We wait until the drip-drip-drip news of his travels. RDU arrival February 22. At at Cameron Village. Went to Church at Christ the King Lutheran Church in Cary.He is described as "before showing symptoms of the illness." The peer-review literature is clear: Asymptomatic carriers can infect people. Infectivity rate is usually 2 people.____LOCAL NEWSCoronavirus sickens second person in NCTags: coronavirus, Chatham CountyPosted 10:25 a.m. todayUpdated 11:02 a.m. today272RALEIGH, N.C. — State health officials said Friday that a second North Carolina person has tested positive for a new strain of coronavirus and is believed to have contracted the COVID-19 illness.The test results need to be confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta.A Chatham County man traveled in late February to an area in Italy that now has a COVID-19 outbreak, officials said. He reported having two days of mild, flu-like symptoms while in Italy. His fever resolved and symptoms were improving, and he flew back to the United States the following day.The man also was in contact with someone from Georgia who contracted COVID-19, so the Georgia Department of Health notified North Carolina health officials.He is now in isolation at home.The Chatham County Public Health Department is working to identify his close contacts to monitor their symptoms. Also, because he had been symptomatic before traveling, the CDC will identify close contacts on the flight thought to be at risk and notify the appropriate public health agencies, officials said.Coronavirus	Coronavirus or the flu: Here's what you should doPublic health officials on Tuesday identified a Wake County man as North Carolina's first COVID-19 case. That man remains in isolation at home, and his family has been quarantined, officials said.The Wake County man had been at a nursing home near Seattle where several people have contracted COVID-19. He returned to the Triangle through Raleigh-Durham International Airport on Feb. 22 but didn't exhibit symptoms for several days, officials said.The man ate at a restaurant in Cameron Village in Raleigh on Saturday night, which has since gone through a professional cleaning. The pastor of Christ the King Lutheran Church in Cary said Thursday that the man is a member of the congregation but was last at the church before showing symptoms of the illness.

RISK FACTORS  Older age  Male sex  Medical comorbidities   Chronic pulmonary disease  Cardiovascular disease (including hypertension and coronary artery disease)  Cerebrovascular disease  Diabetes
HOME DISPOSITION  The vast majority of patients with coronavirus will recover spontaneously, without requiring any medical attention (perhaps >80% of patients)  Patients with mild symptoms can generally be discharged home, with instructions to isolate themselves.  These decisions should be made in coordination with local health departments, who can assist in follow-up.  Features favoring home discharge may include:  Ability to understand and comply with self-isolation (e.g. separate bedroom and bathroom). Ability to call for assistance if they are deteriorating. Having household members who aren't at increased risk of complications from COVID-19 (e.g. elderly, pregnant women, or people with significant medical comorbidities). Lack of hypoxemia, marked chest infiltrates, or other features that would generally indicate admission.

VIRAL MUTATION  USA Hypothesis: COVID that arrives from ASIA might not be the same COVID that arrives from EUROPE. (i.e., West Coast vs. East Coast differences (infectivity, mortality).  The reference says: "COVID-19 is mutating, which may complicate matters even further.  Virulence and transmission will shift over times, in ways which we cannot predict.  New evidence suggests that there are roughly two different groups of COVID-19.  This explains why initial reports from Wuhan described a higher mortality than some more recent case series (Tang et al. 2020; Xu et al 2020). "
CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES  Guidelines disagree about whether to use airborne precautions:   The Canadian Guidelines and World Health Organization guidelines both recommend using only droplet precautions for routine care of COVID19 patients.  However, both of these guidelines recommend airborne precautions for procedures which generate aerosols (e.g. intubation, noninvasive ventilation, CPR, bag-mask ventilation, and bronchoscopy).  The United States CDC recommends using airborne precautions all  the time when managing COVID19 patients.  Using airborne precautions for all patients who are definitely or potentially infected with COVID19 will likely result in rapid depletion of N95 masks.  This will leave healthcare providers unprotected when they actually need these masks for aerosol-generating procedures.  In the context of a pandemic, the Canadian and WHO guidelines may be more sensible in countries with finite resources (i.e. most locales).  However, infection control is ultimately local, so be sure to follow your hospital's guidance regarding this.
WASH YOUR HANDS  Contact Transmission (“fomite-to-face”)  This mode of transmission has a tendency to get overlooked, but it may be incredibly important.  This is how it works:   (i)  Someone with coronavirus coughs, emitting large droplets containing the virus.  Droplets settle on surfaces in the room, creating a thin film of coronavirus.  The virus may be shed in a variety of other bodily fluids as well (e.g. sputum, nasal secretions, stool, saliva, urine, and blood) – so there are a variety of other ways that an infected person could shed virus into the environment.  (ii) The virus persists on fomites in the environment.  Human coronaviruses can survive on surfaces for up to about a week (Kampf et al 2020).  It's unknown how long COVID-19 can survive in the environment, but it might be even longer (some animal coronaviruses can survive for weeks!).  (iii)  Someone else touches the contaminated the surface hours or days later, transferring the virus to their hands.  (iv)  If the hands touch a mucous membrane (eyes, nose, or mouth), this may transmit the infection.  Any effort to limit spread of the virus must block contact transmission.  The above chain of events can be disrupted in a variety of ways:   (a) Regular cleaning of environmental surfaces (e.g. using 70% ethanol or 0.5% sodium hypochlorite solutions; for details see Kampf et al 2020 and CDC guidelines).  (b) Hand hygiene (high concentration ethanol neutralizes the virus and is easy to perform, so this might be preferable if hands aren't visibly soiled)(Kampf 2017).  (c) Avoidance of touching your face.  This is nearly impossible, as we unconsciously touch our faces constantly.  The main benefit of wearing a surgical mask could be that the mask acts as a physical barrier to prevent touching the mouth or nose.  Any medical equipment could become contaminated with COVID-19 and potentially transfer virus to providers (e.g. stethoscope earpieces and shoes).  A recent study found widespread deposition of COVID-19 in one patient's room, but fortunately this seems to be removable by cleaning with sodium dichloroisocyanurate (Ong et al 2020).
ASYMPTOMATIC TRANSMISSION  Asymptomatic transmission could potentially occur in two ways.  (#1) Transmission despite a lack of symptoms seems to be possible (Carlos del Rio 2/28).  (#2) An additional carrier state could occur in patients who have clinically recovered from the virus, but continue shedding the virus.   A recent study found that after convalescence, patients may continue to have a positive pharyngeal PCR for COVID-19 for weeks (Lan 2/27).  However, the clinical significance of these PCR results is unknown.  Convalescing patients probably have a low viral load and relatively low risk of transmission.  CDC guidance is vague on how long patients with known COVID-19 should be isolated.  It may be advisable to obtain two paired RT-PCR tests (one of the nasopharynx and one of the pharynx), with each pair collected >24 hours apart, prior to discontinuing precautions.
GENERAL PROGNOSIS  (1) It remains unclear what fraction of patients are hospitalized.  There may be lots of patients with mild illness who don't present to medical attention and aren't counted.  The vast majority of infected patients (e.g. >80%) don't get significantly ill and don't require hospitalization.  (2) Among hospitalized patients (Guan et al 2/28)   ~10-20% of patients are admitted to ICU.  ~3-10% require intubation.  ~2-5% die.  (3) Longer term outcomes:  Prolonged ventilator dependency ?  Patients who survive the initial phases of the illness may still require prolonged ventilator support (possibly developing some radiographic elements of fibrosis)(Zhang 2020).  As the epidemic progresses, an issue which may arise is a large volume of patients unable to wean from mechanical ventilation.  (Caveat:  There are numerous sets of numbers published and they vary a lot.  However, from the clinician's standpoint the precise numbers don't really matter.)

ABM STATEMENT ON CORONAVIRUS 2019 (COVID-19) March 10, 2020  Please note: information about COVID-19 transmission is emerging daily. The Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine’s recommendations are current as of the publication date. Please consult resources such as the CDC and the WHO for the most recent guidance.  Transmission of COVID-19 through breast milk  Much is unknown about how COVID-19 is spread. Person-to-person spread is thought to occur mainly via respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes, like how influenza (flu) and other respiratory pathogens spread.  In limited studies on women with COVID-19 and another coronavirus infection, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV), the virus has not been detected in breast milk; however we do not know whether mothers with COVID-19 can transmit the virus via breast milk.  Breast milk provides protection against many illnesses. There are rare exceptions when breastfeeding or feeding expressed breast milk is not recommended. CDC has no specific guidance for breastfeeding during infection with similar viruses like SARS-CoV or Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) also both Corona viruses. In a similar situation to COVID-19, the CDC recommends that a mother with flu continue breastfeeding or feeding expressed breast milk to her infant while taking precautions to avoid spreading the virus to her infant. Given low rates of transmission of respiratory viruses through breast milk, the World Health Organization states that mothers with COVID-19 can breastfeed. Current CDC guidance on COVID-19 and breastfeeding is available here.   At Home:  A mother with confirmed COVID-19 or who is a symptomatic person-under-investigation (PUI) for COVID-19 should take all possible precautions to avoid spreading the virus to her infant, including washing her hands before touching the infant and wearing a face mask, if possible, while feeding at the breast. If expressing breast milk with a manual or electric breast pump, the mother should wash her hands before touching any pump or bottle parts and follow recommendations for proper pump cleaning after each use. If possible, consider having someone who is well care for and feed the expressed breast milk to the infant.  Hand hygiene includes use of alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains 60% to 95% alcohol before and after all contact with the affected mother, contact with potentially infectious material, and before putting on and upon removal of personal protective equipment, including gloves. Hand hygiene can also be performed by washing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If hands are visibly soiled, use soap and water before returning to alcohol-based hand sanitizer.  Persons with confirmed COVID-19 infection should remain separate (home isolation precautions) from other family members and friends or neighbors including the infant, except for breastfeeding. Ideally there is another uninfected adult to care for the infant’s needs including feeding the infant expressed breastmilk if the mother is expressing milk and working to maintain her supply of milk. The mother should practice careful handwashing and use of a mask as noted above for at least 5-7 days until cough and respiratory secretions are dramatically improved. It may be useful to involve a healthcare professional and/or the health department in the decision to discontinue home isolation precautions.  In Hospital:  The choice to breastfeed is the mother’s and families.  If the mother is well and has only been exposed or is a PUI with mild symptoms, breastfeeding is a very reasonable choice and diminishing the risk of exposing the infant to maternal respiratory secretions with use of a mask, gown and careful handwashing is relatively easy.  If the mother has COVD-19, there may be more worry, but it is still reasonable to choose to breastfeed and provide expressed milk for her infant. Limiting the infant’s exposure via respiratory secretions may require more careful adherence to the recommendations depending on the mother’s illness.  There are several choices in the hospital concerning housing for a breastfeeding mother and her infant.  Rooming-in (mother and baby stay in the same room without any other patients in that room) with the infant kept in a bassinet 6 feet from the mother’s bed and taking precautions to avoid spreading the virus to her infant, including washing her hands before touching the infant and wearing a face mask, for direct contact with the infant and while feeding at the breast. Ideally, there should be another well adult who cares for the infant in the room. Temporary separation – primarily because the mother is sick with the COVID-19 infection and needs medical care for herself in the hospital. Mothers who intend to breastfeed / continue breastfeeding should be encouraged to express their breast milk to establish and maintain milk supply. If possible, a dedicated breast pump should be provided. Prior to expressing breast milk, mothers should practice hand hygiene. After each pumping session, all parts that come into contact with breast milk should be thoroughly washed and the entire pump should be appropriately disinfected per the manufacturer’s instructions. This expressed breast milk should be fed to the newborn by a healthy caregiver. Mothers and families may need additional guidance and support to continue breastfeeding, to utilize expressed breast milk, to maintain her milk production and to store milk for later use while the mother is sick with COVID-19.
The Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine:  ABM is a worldwide organization of medical doctors dedicated to the promotion, protection, and support of breastfeeding. Our mission is to unite members of the various medical specialties with this common purpose.   For over 20 years, ABM has been bringing doctors together to provide evidence-based solutions to the challenges facing breastfeeding across the globe. A vast body of research has demonstrated significant nutritional, physiological, and psychological benefits for both mothers and children that last well beyond infancy. But while breastfeeding is the foundation of a lifetime of health and well-being, clinical practice lags behind scientific evidence.  By building on our legacy of research into this field and sharing it with the broader medical community, we can overcome barriers, influence health policies, and change behaviors.

This doesn't matter. The problem with the source data is the test positive determines where they are counted.   We have a test positive in Buncombe County claiming primary address in New York State. It's not counted in North Carolina.  Florida State reports 2 data points. North Carolina does not.
Check this out: https://messari.io/coronavirus
You're right, reporting data in NC could be improved. However, the model doesn't get numbers from official counts. The user can adjust the number of cases to whatever they think the true number might be. That and other parameters such as doubling time and number currently hospitalized can be tweaked based on the user's knowledge.  The reason I created an NC version is the Penn Model seems to be a good one and I know from someone involved with planning a hospital's response in another state that many hospitals don't really have good estimates of what they might be facing in terms of patient load and timing.
Got it. The presentation received a lot of press ("leaked secret data"). Are you familiar with the source information? I don't know much about this place. Dr. Lawler: https://www.unmc.edu/intmed/divisions/id/faculty/lawler.html   Also: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anG_l8eOGUw  I live near Asheville. The local news reports: Mission Health System has 84 ventilators and Pardee Hospital has 16 ventilators. That's not a total count for Western North Carolina. I want to pass along the information.  They talked about the masks and PPE and it seems like we don't have a problem in the mountains.   Keep me posted and let me know if you need information from Western North Carolina. I can dig around and provide additional input.

Coronavirus Outdoor Drive-Thru Clinic (South Korea) - Must Implement in North Carolina

Health systems should ideally be put in place to dissuade patients from presenting to the clinic or emergency department for testing to see if they have COVID-19 (e.g. if they have mild constitutional symptoms and don't otherwise require medical attention).  South Korea has developed a system of drive-thru testing, which avoids exposure of other patients in the emergency department.    Outdoor testing also ensures ongoing circulation of fresh air.  A Patient Receives a Nasal Swab.

SC man flew into CLT from Italy. He had coronavirus symptoms the next day, officials say

>"He had not traveled to any other U.S. airport, therefore, we don’t have reason to believe to there was any risk to airport patrons.”   >   >The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention did not recommended following up with passengers on the person’s flight through CLT, Mecklenburg County Public Health Director Gibbie Harris said Monday at a news conference.   >   >The person did not show symptoms until after arriving back in South Carolina, she said. Harris asked the public to stay calm.  These people are absolute morons or liars.  If they don't understand this virus spreads asymptomatically, then they have no business being a part of "Public Health" in any capacity.  It makes me so angry!

We know one of the patients in wake was a teacher as was sent out in the WCPSS letter about closing. Dk what patient # they are and today in press conference they said they are still tracking their movements and trying to find out how it was contracted.   “Saturday, public health officials notified our district that someone associated with Fuquay-Varina Elementary School tested positive for COVID-19. Our decision to close all schools has been difficult. Despite our desire to follow guidance from health officials as we collectively work to minimize the impact of this pandemic, we also want to listen and be responsive to the feedback from our families and staff. We realize that our decision to close schools presents various hardships for many of our families.”
Not to cause panic, but there are cases not being reported at all. I'm a delivery driver, and the entire 6th floor of my local hospital has been sealed off with patients in isolation. I'm assuming the holdup is that they can't get enough tests, but one of my "regulars", a nurse at the hospital I've been delivering to for over a year, told me to stay away from hospitals at all costs, because their isolation floor is full.  All of this is anecdotal, of course, and I don't have any proof... just the word of a terrified-looking nurse who's usually the most cheerful dude in the world. Maybe local news outlets don't want to scare people with info like this? I mean, there's not enough tests to go around, so...  Now I'm petrified to go outside, but as an independent contractor, I have no choice but to keep working as long as I can.

The UBER guy from Queens NY infected 20 people at hospital. Many others are fine.   You have to Lysol your car between patrons. Be blunt: ask them about their health  No big deal. Cleanliness is godliness
I'm using so much Lysol in my car between customers I can't believe I'm not getting high from the fumes, lol. I assume every restaurant and customer is contagious, and every surface is contaminated. I'm also wearing a face mask, and using so much hand sanitizer that I'm surprised I don't have an elevated BAC!  End of last week, people were snickering at me over the face mask. No one is laughing today, and several others are joining me, now.   I take care of a disabled parent, so I'm not joking around with safety. I pull off clothing the moment I walk in and toss it in the washer, and shower immediately. I Lysol down anything that can't be washed.   Believe me, if I could stay in, I would. When I run low on Lysol, if I can't find anymore, I probably will stay in. Everyone's hoarded it. :(
