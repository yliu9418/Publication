Additionally, we know that many of you may be experiencing economic hardships. Based on our experience working with survivors of trauma and natural disaster, we strongly believe that it is important to acknowledge and normalize the effects of an event like the coronavirus, which challenges our sense of safety, control, and routine.This global pandemic is a novel experience for most individuals. For this reason, we would like to invite you to participate in our study of the effects of the coronavirus on psychological functioning. This study will be conducted entirely online and will involve an initial 30-40 minute survey for the first assessment and optional 15-20 minute follow up surveys throughout the following year. These follow-up surveys are optional, but we encourage you to participate in as many of these weekly follow-ups as possible. If you complete the initial survey and the three weekly follow-ups, you may be eligible for a $10 Amazon gift card. The first 100 respondents who complete the initial survey before June 1st and the first 50 after June 1st will receive a gift card. If you have any questions about eligibility, don’t hesitate to contact us at [brainrx@uccs.edu](mailto:brainrx@uccs.edu).

Records reveal data gaps in one of NC’s key COVID-19 metrics [Lack of Consistent, High-Quality Hospital Data Reporting to State Health Department]

I'm not sure what data to look at.  The "7-day rolling average" has trended upwards from 466, 517, 535, and 568. There is no denominator (are there more hospital's reporting?) so we don't know if it's significant or not. Are the new hospitals reporting the day they join and going forward (or do they report all the historical data?)?  It's messy.  Edit: The Mississippi Governor said: Quality reporting does not follow standard operating procedures. States receive "data dumps" from hospitals of different caseloads. He is left with 7-day rolling average as a key metric to make a policy decision.
This is what happens when you are bad at establishing metrics.   They should not have chosen something for which they cannot obtain reliable data. They also should not have chosen absolute numbers, but should have selected a rate instead.  I'm not sure if they were inept, rushed or intentionally vague about some of these, but based on the metrics chosen, there is no clear answer about whether the state will proceed to phase 2 as planned or not.
The overall state ranking is serious. North Carolina has ranked #20 among all states in highest number of total cases.   For MANY months, we've been neck-and-neck with Tennessee and now it's a spread. One Potential Reason: Testing matters.  North Carolina Total Cases 18.6K Death 686 Total # tests 249K  Washington State Total Cases 18.4K Death 1,001 Total # tests 281K  Tennessee Total Cases 17.4K Death 298 Total # tests 325K  Date: May 18 2020
Comparing total counts between states is not very useful, as some states are bigger than others. Here are the per capita rates I calulated for the states you mention:  ||Confirmed Cases (per 1k)|Deaths (per 1k)| |:-|:-|:-| |North Carolina|1.8|0.06| |Washington|2.4|0.13| |Tennessee|2.5|0.04|
This is an area I fall short in (basic?) education.   I've been following the state ranking [here](https://messari.io/coronavirus) as the poor-man's proxy. I see states relative to others go up in rank over time while others go down in rank and just "assume" something good or bad is happening.  I agree my suggested approach misses the mark on accuracy.  Edit: I have been watching data trends and have an opinion. North Carolina was exceptional for a long time and then COVID-19 hit the nursing homes. [The Citizen Times](https://www.citizen-times.com/story/news/local/2020/05/18/67-wnc-coronavirus-deaths-linked-nursing-homes-other-long-term-facilities/5199202002/) wrote an article about the spread.   Nationwide: 1/3 deaths  North Carolina: 57% deaths  I'm sure you'd say this isn't per-capita. :-)
IMO a lot of media outlets have not done a good job in their COVID-19 reporting.  The percentage of nursing home deaths does stand out, but it also leads me to wonder if we have a relatively large nursing home population. Looking this up, it is not the case. North Carolina has 3.41 residents in certified nursing facilities per thousand, vs 4.01 per thousand nationwide. The resident numbers are from https://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/number-of-nursing-facility-residents/?currentTimeframe=0&sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D
Why do you say it's bad? I'm curious as to your reasoning.

At-home COVID-19 sample collection kit gains FDA authorization.

The product is a standalone, at-home, nasal-swab sample collection kit that can be sent to specified labs for subsequent COVID-19 diagnostic testing using certain tests separately authorized by FDA for use with the new kit. The labs authorized to test specimens collected using the authorized kit are Fulgent Therapeutics and Assurance Scientific Laboratories. Individuals must be screened via an online questionnaire, the results of which are reviewed by health care professionals, in order to gain access to the kit. Results are returned to the patient through Everlywell's independent physician network and online portal.My commentary: You better read the instructions carefully! Sample contamination would suck. Please let us know the out-of-pocket cost, your experience using the device, your customer experience, and was it easy to understand the results (and were the results timely or not).Also: Please let us know if this is an approved test kit for pets. It's highly likely it's illegal to administer to your cat or ferret. Call customer service and ask what's approved? You never know until you ask.

Preach!   Phase 1: May 8  Phase 2: May 25   The metrics don't matter, eh? We are moving to re-open.  :-)
Phase 2 is really more like phase 1.5 - nothing like what was originally outlined.
On-point. It's the budget over health.

I wonder what normal ICU utilization is?  The whole "flatten the curve" thing was because hospitals don't have a big supply of ICU beds/nurses/doctors/ventilators.  They run close to capacity normally because having extra capacity costs $$.  But what's normal?  75%?
Thank god Hooters is open though.

SPIKING
I work for a hospital system in wake and Durham counties. We have seen an increase in cases (both general and ICU hospitalizations). So far it's well within what we can handle. I'm not posting this to add to, or subtract from, any arguments for or against reopening. I'm only stating a fact from one hospital system's perspective.
It's going to be ok.
Pretty much.
I tracked ICU utilization from Mar 28 - May 2. The highest I saw was 80.3% on (Apr 2), but it tended to fluctuate in the 75 +/- 2% area after that.
It varies from the 50s-80s throughout the country.  > Over the three years studied, total *ICU occupancy* ranged from 57.4% to 82.1%  with the mean being 62%.   https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3840149/
it's up to 702, now.
No! I’m not coming out until nothing bad happens anymore!
So we’re not really that far off? IIRC Sen Jackson said something around 70% during the start of this here in NC... so I don’t see 80% as a doom and gloom number.  We knew that there would be an increase from opening, that is the nature of the beast. We can’t stay like this indefinitely.
which... if I'm reading the data and cipherin correctly means about 5% of the people currently hospitalized in NC have the 'rona.   That's quite different from what we saw in Italy, China, Ecuador, NYC etc where the hospitals had covid-19 patients out in the hallways, in offices,  and in break rooms.  However, this 702 doesn't count all the old geezers with living wills and DNR who are in their nursing home beds... and there's a bunch of them.
The screenshot from earlier this morning shows 621 hospitalized with 78% of hospitals reporting. The 702 number from the afternoon says 92% of hospitals reporting.   Meaning this increase could be attributed solely to new hospitals reporting their numbers and not actually many new hospitalizations.   This isn’t the first time this has happened here in NC either, about a month ago there was a spike in hospitalizations and the N&O ran an article about the issues accurately tracking hospitalizations without all hospitals reporting.   Most huge data spikes are likely going to be attributed to errors in data reporting results, an increase or decrease in testing, or new tracing. Just like how you see the number of tests performed each day has some days really low and other days with huge spikes. That is because all labs report positives the day they find them, but some private labs dump all their negative test results to the state once a week, making it look like we did a ton of testing on that one day.  EDIT: Not to say there hasn’t been an increase, just that it probably isn’t a spike but has been more gradual with bad data reporting.
The graph shows the 14 day rolling average, not current total.
If you go outside you *literally* are killing all the nursing home patients they deliberately put around people testing positive for the kungflu.
The mean average is 62%...and no we can't..but we can't throw data and reason out the window.
"CURRENTLY HOSPITALIZED 702"  The yellow line is a rolling average.  The blue bar is not.
Mean average doesn't mean shit for our state. That's not **our** baseline.  You can't shout 'we're 18% above average now!' and completely leave out the fact that we were 8% over average when we started.

He can either send the NCSHP in or the NG but he's certainly not powerless.
I know he can, but let's not forget that Alamance county leans pretty red. And you can be sure if armed police come in there, it's only going to escalate things further.  If people in Michigan were going armed to protest their governments, I don't think it's far-fetched to think similar would happen here.

Trump Forced Meat Processing Plants to Stay Open. Now There's Almost 600 Workers With Coronavirus at a North Carolina Plant.

Trump didn’t force a private business to not do their due diligence in keeping their workers safe and tested.   Blame the companies. They don’t care about their workforce. They’re replaceable.
The President's order to stay open: https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/president-donald-j-trump-taking-action-ensure-safety-nations-food-supply-chain/  There is no mention of hazard pay, PPE, routine testing, or healthcare.
Thank you. I came here to say this.  POTUS has no day over a private business.  This title is not but a hit job.
At a meat packing plant, there is almost no way you're going to be able to do your job AND be safe from the virus. You're working in a refrigerator (the chilly environment is both great for the virus and bad for the immune system). The spaces are cramped, so there's no way to distance yourself from other workers. It's loud, so to communicate with anyone you're going to have to shout.
Which packing plants have you visited?

Isn’t every day a new high? It’s not like the numbers are decreasing.
So would this be the spike from phase 1?
we're all fucked
It’s the number of people *currently hospitalized*.  Not cumulative.
More likely the spike from "I don't give a shit what the governor is saying, I'm tired of being in lockdown when *nobody I know has gotten the rona*... so I'm going to dollar general and I ain't wearing no stoopid mask"
Nah that spike is yet to come. Wait a month... :(
Which is an inevitable result of lockdown anyhow...
