NC Covid 19 cases by zip code

The color code isn’t super accurate, 27410 is lighter than 27455 but 27410 has more cases.   Also shoutout to 27265’s case count. Nice.
If you look at the key it's not by number of cases but by cases per 10,000 pop. 27265 has a larger population, so even though they have more cases it's less per 10,000 than 27410.
Ah that makes sense

Harris Teeter offers free COVID 19 testing in High Point

Wow. That's awesome. The article says drive-thru testing several days a week from 10-4 at a parking garage. Go Harris teeter.
Important to note it's for "qualifying individuals."

North Carolina reports highest one day spike of Covid-19 cases

Going over the CDC's numbers, more people have died from this virus *in this state alone* in less than three months than people have died from the flu *in the last three flu seasons.* This is not a joke. This is not a hoax. This is not a conspiracy. And above all, *THIS IS NOT POLITICAL.* This is Nature, itself, we are dealing with. A hurricane isn't a Republican. A blizzard isn't a Democrat. And a virus outbreak isn't either. This virus is doing exactly what it evolved to do, infect and multiply within a host and find a new host to multiply within. That's it. It doesn't have an agenda. It's not human. It's not evil. It's not good. It doesn't have a moral code. It can't be reasoned with. It can't shamed on twitter. Again, it is Nature, itself. Like you would put on a coat defend yourself against the cold or sunblock to defend yourself against the sun, you need to put on a mask and keep your distance from each other as much as you can. This is how you defend yourself against Nature in this circumstance. Yes, there are people who need to work. And let them work. But if you don't have to go out and mix among other people, then don't. The less you go out, the less chance you give this virus to find you, to infect you, to multiply within you and to turn you into another carrier. You are putting yourself outside this virus's life cycle by staying home.
If I die because all of these fucking idiots can’t be bothered to sit at home and fail at make sourdough starters, I’m going to haunt the shit out of everyone on a randomly rotating basis.
What's really frustrating is these people who don't want to wear masks stand literally inches behind you at the store now! In the last two weeks I've had this happen a few times already and I'm fighting to not go off on them. I'm a very passive guy, but it's testing my patience. They seem to continue to think it's a hoax or overblown and don't respect the people who are trying to follow the rules.
BuT lEtS rEoPeN!
We the best! /s
Someone in my building last week was tested positive. Public health called me to get tested. Luckily I was negative. Hopefully they are doing well whoever they are and no one else tests positive.
Welp we're boned or a lot crazy grandpas are about to die.
Two weeks it's going to be NYC bad around here and our hospitals aren't nowhere near NYC capable. RIP all those who are going to lose their loved ones and lives in the coming weeks ...
iM sO sKeErD Of ChInUh ViRuSsSs lol I can’t wait to revisit this thread in 8 months after the election and how it will be a non factor and how everyone here will still cling to their virtuous attitudes of how they did their part and everyone else was an “idiot”.  Lol essential workers have been at work this whole time, why haven’t they been dropping like flies if it’s So DaNgErOuS? Let others be and leave them outta your judgements so they can go back to work too so we can pay for the taxes all of your trump checks came out of 🙄🙄🙄🤣🤣  There have been 49 deaths ****TOTAL**** in guilford county, 30 PPL DIE A DAY from drunk driving, yet liquor stores are deemed essential!!! I don’t see anyone closing ABC stores 🤔🤔🤔 large retailers generate more tax revenue for the state, that’s why wal mart/home improvement stores/liquor stores/tobacco and countless other “essential” big box style stores were allowed to stay open by daddy govt. like I said, if you’re so scared of it, stay home, don’t go to work, don’t go to wal mart, don’t go to the gas station, and think of it as “doing your part” lol the rest of us “essentials” will be out here paying taxes to keep your unemployment checks afloat.

> sunblock to defend yourself against the sun  I wore sunblock a couple times and didn't get burned. The sun is a hoax! I'm gonna go to Myrtle Beach and lay in the sun for 16 hours to own the libs! My body, my choice!
The only reason why it's political is because of businesses. And businesses are very political because it save them money and can even make money. Bailouts, tax cuts, etc.   So when nature interferes with business, its downplayed. Global warming is given a nicer name like climate change. Death counts are called over exaggerated. Eventually people come along and join in with their own clams and shows of evidence because they truly believe that we need business to function or at the very least to make retirement funds climb.
If you scared stay at home bruh
People who do that are just itching for someone to go off on them so they can say how they are not "sheeple" and this virus thing is a hoax. What you have to do is make this closing apolitical. If this were any other time and someone was doing this to you, you would turn around and tell them to stop being so creepy and back off. And that's what you need to do. Tell them, "Dude, you are being creepy standing so close to me. Like one of those perverts on the subway. Stop it. You are grossing me out." It's going to be hard for them to argue with you politically when you don't make it political but instead, make it socially awkward.
These people are everywhere.  Apparently  they feel as though they are invincible and don't care about people who actually have a healthy level of fear/respect for this virus and look at you like a moron because you're wearing a mask and cleaning your hands with sanitizer.
I wish you luck and health... I am afraid things are going to get much more difficult to avoid going forward because people are ignorant and act like the virus is a joke...
Which city??
"Why don't you mention the fact that the expanded testing here in NC in the last few days is the main reason these numbers are going up?"   Because that would be inaccurate. Testing rate increase of 10-1000 is 100 fold. Testing in North Carolina has maintained a rolling average of about 10,000 per day for the past ten days and a rolling average of about 5,000 per day this time last month.   So, testing has doubled in the last 30 days roughly. (See link below) That's not an increase of 100 fold as you used as an example therefore, I do not agree that this article is sensationalist.   https://covid19.ncdhhs.gov/dashboard/testing  The flu is known to have a mortality rate of about .1%. Estimates on Covid-19 suggest that it has a mortality rate of .6%. That's 5 times the flu. To suggest that enough is known this early in the cycle is premature. This is a moving target that, if history is any indication, will have many waves of infection and may evolve into a more deadly strain such as the Spanish flu or may disappear such as the Swine flu did in 2009.
Whoa look, a fucking moron.
Gyms are a fucking petri dish. Athletes foot, staph … let a member get a cold and see how fast it runs through the membership. It's an everyday occurrence at gyms so this situation is another level entirely. I miss my gym. I've gained 15 pounds. But there's no way I'm going back in there until the heat and humidity of summer tamps this shit down.
That guy can't even do basic math right. At 1:15 he starts giving numbers from the government website and says it's 0.0021%, but it's actually 0.21%.  Then there's the whole part where the only reason the numbers aren't higher is BECAUSE of the quarantine orders.
But you are talking about the actions of humans who are doing this. The virus, that thing you see under a microscope, is not political. It is the humans who have turn this whole pandemic political. Again, the virus, itself, doesn't have an R or a D by its name.
It would be nice if adults weren't acting like spoiled children. Some people are looking for confrontations and showing no respect.
Are you the type of person who doesn't use your signal because you already know that you're turning?
Look at the tough guy
Lol, I like this a lot! I wish I thought of that at the time.
nah
Greensboro
I honestly can't believe how people are drawn towards these conspiracy theories. This guy is losing money, I get that. It's his income. I totally understand.  But to claim that the government is trying to control citizens by keeping the gyms closed is so unbelievably comical..
You must have fail at math class....21618 divided by 10,500,000 is .00020588.
It would be nice if ppl like all of you that are so scared of a pandemic that’s really actually not affecting anyone in decent health or younger than 65, would let ppl make their own decisions instead of your mob mentality shaming ppl for not being scared to go out daily, for not wanting to wear a mask, for already having good hygiene prior to this plandemic, nobody is trying to be a tough guy, why are you ppl persecuting ppl for not being afraid of something that’s not very likely to harm you?    It’s the same principle as being afraid to go into the woods cause you might get attacked by a bear, which actually has a higher probability then dying from covid.   Like I said, if you’re scared stay at home? Let ppl live their lives and make their own decisions regarding their own health, don’t sit in the back of the room on reddit and talk shit about ppl who are going out and doing their thing to get back to work to provide for their families and are completely unaffected by this less than lethal threat of an exotic flu. You’re all the same ppl who shame ppl for their beliefs instead of affording them their 1st amendment rights lol, you want to make decisions for yourself cUz mUh RiGhTs but you also want to make decisions for everyone else too, cause you have no respect for individual rights, if they don’t match yours. Smh sad how you all think your enemies are ppl who exercise their free will and not the ppl who are taking it from you
"If you're scared of getting in a wreck, don't ride in a car bro"  These people are driving me nuts.
Derp - I thought I was on the NC sub, not the GSO sub. Sorry!  I'm curious what building you live in but you may not want to share. I suppose if it were in my building I'd get a call from public health?
What you just said is the right ***first step*** in calculating a percentage, but next you have to multiply by 100 to get the percent. Without that second step you just have the decimal form of a fraction, not the percent. It's a common mistake.   Edit (A simple illustration of the math): I think we can both agree that 1 is fifty percent of 2.   `1 / 2 = 0.5`    `0.5 * 100 = 50`
Man all I was talking about is people need to back the fuck up off me. You are a pretty good example of the people I have a problem with, spouting a lot of bull shit when getting in my space. I don't think you even know what the fuck a right is.
> It would be nice if ppl like all of you that are so scared of a pandemic that’s really actually not affecting anyone in decent health or younger than 65  Tell me, the people who are dying don't have any families? They died alone. Buried themselves. They weren't taken care of by doctors. Nurses. They aren't straining our hospitals. Taking up beds that are needed by those battling other diseases. They also haven't infected anyone. And by infecting those other people, they didn't make those people suffer at all. Make them miss work. Or infect other people. Sending them to doctors and making them put even more strain on our healthcare workers Carrying on the cycle.   No one lives in a bubble. It's impossible. The world is too small. We are just parts in a giant Rube Goldberg machine. We look like individuals that seemingly have nothing in common. A shoe, a bowling pin, a string, a pair of scissors, a cord, an anvil. But in the bigger picture, in this Goldberg machine, the shoe knocks over the bowling pin with the string tied around the neck, because the pin falls down, the string is pulled, the other end of the string is tied to a pair of scissors and because it is being pulled, it closes, cutting the cord that is attached to an anvil, it drops the anvil, which sets off further motion along the machine. Again, if I were to put these items in a row in random order, you wouldn't see how they are connected. But in reality, they are. That's how society works. You might think you are an individual and what you do has no effect on those around you but you are wrong. It does. It always will.
^^ found the guy who doesn't understand exponents.
[Per the NC DHHS](https://www.ncdhhs.gov/news/press-releases/ncdhhs-identifies-percent-north-carolinians-higher-risk-severe-illness-covid-19), over 51% of all people in the state are at high risk of death from COVID-19.
This. I’m so sick of the “if you’re scared stay home” argument. As an essential worker I can’t do that. Fortunately my job doesn’t require a lot of interpersonal contact but I do have to interact with some people every day. The more restrictions get lifted the more likely THOSE people are to infect me, no matter how careful I am—and I’m very careful. I have several existing conditions that make me vulnerable (although I’m only 38). My partner has COPD and no insurance. I’m grateful to still be working but every day is terrifying for me. Don’t rush this process. Also: no one WANTS to wear a freaking mask. It doesn’t make you look weak. It doesn’t make you look controlled. It makes you look like a decent human being. If everyone would just stop throwing tantrums and crying “‘MURICA!” and follow the guidelines given by medical professionals we could beat this thing.
It was my workplace. The person that tested positive named me and others in our office as people they had contact with. I'm assuming that's the procedure when someone tests positive. I'm also assuming they contacted others this person doesn't work with but came into contact with so they can get tested.
Again it's .020588%....not .21%..
Your demonstrating one right now, free speech. Turn around and ask a person to step back then, or like I said if you’re so scared to go out in public cause ppl don’t provide you the space you feel you need, then DONT FUCKIN GO OUTSIDE BRUH!!! If you can’t fuckin swim and you’re afraid you might drown, what would you reasonably consider to do if faced with the opportunity to get in a pool? I’m spitting 📠📠 mf, legit data from the cdc and a simple calculator, I’m not in your space, I’m in your head right now cause you hate factual debates
Per math .00737% of all ppl in the state have perished from covid, and .2275% of all ppl have been confirmed infected 🤔🤔🤔 please sit down with your weak statistics.
Ahh. Thanks. Good luck!
You are mistaken. I didn't notice that you had done the division wrong and were off by a decimal place in your first reply (in addition to forgetting to multiply by 100).  [21,618 / 10,500,000 = 0.00205885714](https://www.google.com/search?q=21%2C618+%2F+10%2C500%2C000) notice it's only two zeros between the decimal point and the 2, not three zeros as you gave  [0.00205885714 rounds to 0.0021](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=0.00205885714+rounded+to+4+decimal+places) (which is why that's what he gave in the video, his only mistake was forgetting to multiply by 100)  0.0021 * 100 is 0.21 which is exactly the number I gave in my first comment.
See you are talking about something else than I'm talking about. I'm talking about stupid mother fuckers like you that try to get close and talk to me when I'm just trying to get some milk. You can be as dumb as you want just keep that shit away from me.
.00001% of the US population died in the sept 11, 2001 terrorist attacks,   nO bIg DeAL 🤷‍♂️
I’m just responding to your line: > a pandemic that’s really actually not affecting anyone in decent health or younger than 65  I just want you to be aware that when you say that, you’re talking about over half the population of the state.
PPL WHO GET IN YOUR SPACE NOW WOULD ALSO DO IT BEFORE THE PANDEMIC lol, blame folks with poor social manners not ppl trying to show you the light from your fears of the beer flu.  It’s ok, some of us have to be at work, so some of you can stay home in fear and hoard toilet paper so other families have to wipe their ass with socks bruh. You’re the epitome of what right wingers call “sheep” lol bow down to your masters in politics while the rest of us cut the tv off and provide you with stimulus money.   Do some forethought into what the world will look like after the TV stops delivering your daily ration of fear mongering, ppl are gonna need jobs, money, and opportunities, and it’s the folks who weren’t afraid of the flu and went back to work without permission that will keep America afloat, you know blue collar/middle class tax payers lol
All in one inside attack, your ignorance is showing, you have no data to prove me wrong so you result to insults and irrelevant large group death data like this. 9/11 happened in one day within a couple hours, not over the course of 6 months 😩😩😩 you’re mad you were fooled by the tv I can’t help your fear
Nice cherry picked statistics homie, now go back and click the hyper link in the article you provided labeled “according to analyzed data” and scroll down, you’ll see that in NC WITH AT LEAST ONE UNDERLYING CONDITION, AND CONFIRMED COVID 19 CASE,AGE GROUP 0-49yrs infection rate is only 18% of ALL infected residents, while ages 50 and up are 51% of the number infected.   So this basically shows that EVEN WITH AN UNDERLYING CONDITION still only 18% of the 22k confirmed cases are ppl 0-49 yrs in age!!!! And checking population percentile per age group also shows that 65.5% of the ENTIRE state population is under 45yrs of age!!!! While age groups 45 and up only make up 34.5% of the population they also carry over HALF of the confirmed cases!! DO SOME FUCKIN MATH BRUHHH THE VIRUS IS NOT THAT BIG A THREAT TO YOU IF YOU DONT FALL IN A HIGHER AGE GROUP OR HAVE MULTIPLE UNDERLYING CONDITIONS OR DISEASES!
Just so youre aware- underlying conditions include things that aren't what most people think of as death sentences. Underlying conditions include things like obesity, high blood pressure, thyroid problems, etc.
Right, and EVEN WITH ALL THESE PPL who have underlying conditions, only .2273 of the population in the state has been infected and 51% of those were over 60!!!! You’re proving me right and you’re not seeing it lol no hate here I’m not mad.    So with all these high risk ppl and no proof in the pudding is it still high risk when not even a 1/4 percentile of the population has been infected even tho 51% of the state is “high risk” cause they’re overweight and etc? I’m just trynna show you the stats are convoluted to scare you is all
Maybe it won't affect you. And that's great!   How about the mom in cancer treatment, who may be exposed by an asymptomatic carrier at the grocery store? Or the grandpa, exposed by another carrier at his doctors office?  Or how about my former coworker, an ER RN, who died from covid exposure at work. He was 44, and his only "condition" was mild obesity. He left behind a wife and 2 kids.  I think the important thing to consider- even if you don't fall ill, or your immediate family- please try and be considerate of the vulnerable.  I'm not going to change your mind on the severity of covid. Thats fine. Just please remember those who it is more serious for, and let's all try to be mindful of one another.   Stay well.

Can I Be Evicted During Coronavirus?

So the government is going to force people to give free housing to people without compensation?   Does this mean property owners no longer have a right to their own property?   So everyone has a right to an income except landlords?
Well there *was* that small business aid program thing that President Porno was talking about.
" So the government is going to force people to give free housing to people without compensation?"  Was that the conclusion they provided in the article? And you mean without landlords getting paid, right?  &#x200B;  "Does this mean property owners no longer have a right to their own property? "  It's a bit more nuanced than that. Read below:  " So everyone has a right to an income except landlords? "  Outside of a few exceptions, most landlords I know do this for a living, and by such own/rent 4-5 homes, minimum, at a time. This means you've spent your time and career acquiring property with the intention of giving people a place to live, and in the hopes of possessing an income stream that, while challenging to maintain at times, is large enough that you can pay specialists and others to do work for any emergencies or issues that come up with your tenants and properties (if you're landlording correctly).  Your renters losing their ability to pay their rent because they lost their paycheck due to the coronavirus, and subsequently you losing your income because the people you relied upon to live lost their income, makes you a parasite.
This makes zero sense. In no way are you a parasite for supplying people with necessities. I mean does this make Duke energy, Harris teeter, and spectrum all parasites as well for charging for what some would call essentials? Tenants signed a contract to pay X dollars a month to stay in a spot you owned. If they are refusing to fulfill their end of the contract then the government shouldn't be making it a pain in the ass to enforce the landlords end.
