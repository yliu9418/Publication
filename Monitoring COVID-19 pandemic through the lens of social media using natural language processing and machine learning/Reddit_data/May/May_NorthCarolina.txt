How would I, as a currently healthy person, go about getting a Covid-19 antibody test done?
Are there any places offering antibody tests to the general public in the state (particularly the Triad)?I, along with my family and lots of people I work with, all had a pretty nasty cold-like illness back in Feb/March, and my curiosity is running wild with the idea that we may have all had mild cases of Covid-19 without knowing it.I feel like this is a pretty common thing that people are thinking and talking about now. I specifically remember being sick the week prior to the shutdown being announced.Does anybody have any insight on this topic? I feel like it would definitely help with the metrics if we knew where people were on the *have it / had it / haven't had it* spectrum.
Look for a research study. Most of them are remote. I‚Äôm currently doing a study with Wake Forest Baptist (you have to be a patient with them). I haven‚Äôt had symptoms or been exposed really so I don‚Äôt think I qualify for the antibody portion, but I work in clinical research and I‚Äôve seen a ton of antibody studies come through recently.
Quest Diagnostics offering them for $130
Labcorp is offering them at $150
https://starmed.care/
If you want to pay for it yourself:  [Quest Diagnostics COVID-19 Antibody Test](https://questdirect.questdiagnostics.com/products/covid-19-immune-response/b580e541-78a5-48a6-b17b-7bad949dcb57)  It says to contact your healthcare provider to get it for no cost to you.
I think LabCorp is doing this. Go to lab-locations.com to see all locations in NC.  Don‚Äôt know how much it costs but there‚Äôs a decent chance your insurance company would cover it. You might want to call them just to be sure.
I might just have to look around for studies, then.  Question: is there as strict of a requirement for PPE to do the antibody tests as it is for the viral tests? I'd like to avoid putting a strain on the system by using up PPE that would be needed elsewhere.
I saw they were 119 through quest, but I don't know if that includes taxes/shipping/etc.
Not that I‚Äôm aware of. And like I said, many are remote - no office visits needed. For the WFBH study, they mail the antibody kit to your house, you do a finger prick, and mail it back.
I think they tack on a medical service fee at the end which brings it up to about $130 :)  Edit: I‚Äôm in Charlotte, so that was at least my experience here
Don‚Äôt think so
The thing is, I'm an essential employee and have been going to work every day like normal since this all began. Granted, I try to protect myself and those around me, but no one here is wearing any PPE at work and we're not really changing anything other than more handwashing.  I am also our designated go-to-the-grocery-store person in my family, so I feel like there is definitely a chance I could have been exposed without knowing it.  My own curiosity aside, I feel like widespread elective testing of the general public could only be helpful, right? I don't mind at all if my results are recorded by the state.
That makes sense I was just curious to the discrepancy. Wild times!
Also, there is no current evidence suggesting that having antibodies mean you are immune from catching the virus multiple times.

NORTH CAROLINA COVID-19 CASES JUMP 586 TO 11,509 IN LARGEST SINGLE DAY INCREASE; 420 TOTAL DEATHS AFTER 21 MORE REPORTED

Fuck this bs headline. For actual info see the [NCDHHS website. ](https://www.ncdhhs.gov/divisions/public-health/covid19/covid-19-nc-case-count#cases-over-time)  That number is just the adjustment from all the cases that got reported at the end of the week and each day gets a few cases added.  And the numbers from this week seem to be better than the ones from last week.  But we‚Äôll see how they get adjusted as all the numbers come in.
See y'all in September.

Wonder why these fear mongerers never present the data in percentage points related to the Census population numbers?  NC Population ([Census.gov](https://Census.gov)) - 10.49 million  NC Coronavirus Cases (NCDHHS.gov) - 11,509 Confirmed Lab Tests  NC Coronavirus Deaths - 420  No need to do the basic math, because I already know the arguments of infection rate of those tested (going down currently  at 8.3%), death rate(down to 3.6%), hospitalization rate (down to 4.5%) , and moving statistics. The fact remains though, these stats are going down.   We also know these numbers are mostly elderly, already living in assisted care facilities, & counted as a coronavirus death because they tested positive at the time of death. There's also the fact that some like WHO & Fauci keep applying machine learning models to data sets entirely too small for machine learning algorithms in favor of classical statistical models that generate far more accurate results.  Now you got everyone in government salivating over federal money, while small businesses are being asked to take out loans in places where political opposition chooses to keep states shut. Cooper might be the veto stamp king, but at least he wasn't begging for ventilators everyday like Cuomo. Once everyone found out money was tied to vents, it looked bad politically and they all stopped talking about vents.  I'm with the liberals on blaming Donald Trump too, except for a different reason. He should have never caved on this BS. This thing was here in late 2019, and it will be proven, and coronavirus is here FOREVER people. FOREVER! You aren't hiding from coronavirus, you're just delaying the inevitable. It's a novel virus, human body has to have it before it knows how to produce the antibody, which it does know how to do.  The economic disaster from this will be horrific & historic. This will go down as the biggest mass media generated hysteria of all time and potentially a bigger economic disaster than the Great Depression. All because a group of politicians don't want to see Donald Trump re-elected, they'll spread it out long as they can  As Mr. Leahey would say "Total shitstorm, and no umbrella, get ready for a shit fest once this shit is over Randy"
I like how it's written to suggest the jump is from 586 cases to 11,509 cases in one day at first glance. Gotta get that page click ad revenue.
See you in school.
No worries, yelling this is completely justified.
^ two month old account who trolls various state subreddits downplaying Corona numbers and insulting people.   Interesting. Very interesting.
You ready to be a statistic?
I don't think you understand the point of flattening the curve.   Your premise is right...  ...Effectively, over time, the same number of people will be infected, with or without social distancing. So, you're right. We can't hide from it until we have a vaccine (which may never happen!).   WITH social distancing and the economically devastating shutdowns we've been experiencing, though... the cases will be spread out to the point that hospitals, and our medical system in general, can prepare for the needs presented by the virus.   This is why companies (that had nothing to do with PPE, ventilators, etc) have been busting their respective asses to manufacture supplies that will eventually be needed across the country or (best case) stockpiled for the next pandemic.    WITHOUT social distancing, millions of people would have died... Both from Covid19 and from all sorts of other medical conditions, because our healthcare system would have been fucking wrecked by this virus. The loss of life would have been extreme.   We weren't prepared for this outbreak. Not having the testing capability up front was catastrophic. If we had the proper systems already in place, we would have had an actual chance at containment & everybody could have basically carried on with their normal lives.   My political spin isn't necessary here.  We'll hopefully know better next time, because everything about this sucks.
So you're wishing death on people just for moving here? What the fuck is wrong with you?
Shhhhh he‚Äôs the authority on the subject xD
I don‚Äôt know. Important information to keep up with, but phrased in the most alarming way possible. Positive results as a percentage of tests performed is actually 7% (https://www.ncdhhs.gov/divisions/public-health/covid19/covid-19-nc-case-count), which is in keeping with an almost 2 week decrease.  Citing a large increase of cases without pointing out that A) percent of positives is still trending down, and, B) higher number of positives are partly explained by a higher than average number of tests processed, seems a little irresponsible.  Not the OPs fault, but the all-caps, alarming headline from abc11 does not seem justified, nor do I see them putting these numbers in context in the article.
A statistic of people who don‚Äôt know how to vet the headlines they read? This is clickbait.
I thought he was looking for a kidney transplant cause type 2 diabetes... took me a second to realize he's hating on people from places other than his high school zone.
Obvious troll is obvious. He misses his middle school friends. Ignore.
I literally linked the data from the state website.  That doomsday ‚Äò586‚Äô number is the number of previously unreported positive tests from throughout the week that.  The numbers from each day were updated accordingly.  If you actually looked at the daily numbers, no single day this week gets to 586.  And the number of new cases for this week seems to be lower than those from last week.
Total clickbait.  Get your numbers from the [NCDHHS website](https://www.ncdhhs.gov/divisions/public-health/covid19/covid-19-nc-case-count#cases-over-time)
Care to elaborate as it pertains to this post?
Would you mind terribly if I borrowed your crystal ball to see the future? Trump‚Äôs economy is going to hell in a hand basket so I need to future proof my holdings.
420√∑11,470=0.0366172624  That's 3.66%. Move the decimal two places to get a percentage.  That's a 36.6% higher mortality than the flu (for North Carolina, internationally it's closer to 70%).  But let's look at the international numbers and the US numbers, shall we?  Around the world: Infected - 3,267,184 Deaths - 229,971 Percent - 7.03  United States: Infected - 1,092,815 Deaths - 64,283 Percent - 5.88  All the numbers listed are from the CDC and NCDHHS websites.
Tsk Tsk. Didn‚Äôt I just concede to your mastery of the subject matter?

What a MAGAT thing to say lol.
Those numbers reflect all known cases, symptomatic and asymptomatic alike. You can't factor in untested populations because they're not tested. It's almost assured that those numbers will reflect what's been observed.  Also, the asymptomatic infected represent a small portion of the total number of total infected. It's unlikely that they'll affect the infection:mortality ratio.
If I had a preference, this wouldn't be happening at all (my hope was for this all to blow over with minimal impact, but that isn't the case). However, there is the matter of you and your views - you're willfully ignorant and that, sadly, won't change in the foreseeable future. I hope no one you know goes through what I've seen from all of this, but I do hope your mind changes with expereince.

Coronavirus: COVID-19 cases by zip code is new NCDHHS feature

Here's the [actual NCDHHS site](https://www.ncdhhs.gov/divisions/public-health/covid19/covid-19-nc-case-count#zip-code-map).
If I could make one recommendation, at this point in the pandemic, I think the majority of "total cases" are now recovered.  So, knowing the total cases for a zip code is not very productive.  Maybe a 14 day rolling count of new cases so we can visualize where the outbreak is still happening.
That UI gave me cancer
ALL of these numbers are totally useless without widespread testing available.  WHERE is my test?
I am not doing a great job of explaining the point. Dr Birx does a much better job.  https://www.bing.com/videos/search?view=detail&mid=E4F2624ED162F9745126E4F2624ED162F9745126&shtp=GetUrl&shid=57fc9da7-0a3e-4e37-9775-f4e81ab176ee&shtk=RHIgQmlyeCAtIEhBTEYgb2YgQ292aWQgdGVzdHMgdGhhdCB0ZXN0IHBvc2l0aXZlLi4uYXJlIGZhbHNlLXBvc2l0aXZlcw%3D%3D&shdk=RHIgQmlyeCAtIEhBTEYgKG9yIG1vcmUhKSBvZiBDb3ZpZCB0ZXN0cyB0aGF0IHRlc3QgcG9zaXRpdmUgYXJlIGxpa2VseSB0byBiZSBmYWxzZS1wb3NpdGl2ZXMuIGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlvdXR1YmUuY29tL3dhdGNoP3Y9R2ROLS0xMWJ0YzAgQXByaWwgMjA6IFVTIEFEVklTT1IgRHIgRGVib3JhaCBCaXJ4IHN0YXRlZCB5b3UgY2FuIG5vdCBhc3N1bWUgdGhlIENvdmlkIHRlc3QgcG9zaXRpdmUgcmVzdWx0IGlzIGNvcnJlY3QgLSBpdCBpcyBsaWtlbHkgdG8gYmUgd3JvbmcgbW9zdCBvZiB0aGUgdGltZSAtIGEgImZhbHNlIHBvc2l0aXZlIi4gU2hlIHNheXM6ICJJZiB5b3UgaGF2ZSAxJSBvZiB0aGUgLi4u&shhk=WE4Nzvy8HrqrYJh1KjvoQSiaZyYQJt%2FonxhHTSM7NdU%3D&form=VDSHOT&shth=OSH.VMt3Ui8hxFeVJWjjf6RyBA
A shame that the county-by county one doesn't actually work beyond the different shades of blue. I think Facebook has a functional one.
Using zip codes to map geospatial data is [not a good practice] (https://carto.com/blog/zip-codes-spatial-analysis/)
SC had this almost a month ago.
when you type in a zip in the search on the map, it just takes you to that zip. it doesnt give you numbers.
Agreed - really frustrating to see the headlines of "NC Tops 14k cases" or whatever we're at, with less focus on how many ACTIVE cases there are. That's the whole idea, flattening the curve so there aren't an overwhelming amount of CONCURRENT cases...so why not focus on that?
This might be true in rural areas but I think the urban areas aren‚Äôt in as good of shape
>  at this point in the pandemic  What point do you think we are at?  According to the available data, including infected, recovered, tested (https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6), we are still at the beginning.
Only 200,000 cases out of the 1.2 million have had an outcome. So the majority of people have not recovered.  Most of the non gov sites are going to show you a 7 day rolling avg of cases and the other numbers.  # of tests on avg and the % positive of those tests, along with hospitalization numbers are what I‚Äôm looking at.  I would imagine this data is more for media and organizations to track and process to do all the stuff the government won‚Äôt or can‚Äôt do, but that‚Äôs a whole different political issue.
Total case count is still a productive number.  At this rate, flattening the curve is still the most important to reduce the amount of deaths, but there is no guaranteed vaccine.  We‚Äôre still looking at a long term herd immunity solution.  Total cases/total population should correspond to an eventual slowing down of the rate of infection.
I think it was made by the same people that did the Unemployment website. Lol
at least it didn't give you the 'rona.
4 months into "shit hit the fan" with this and people in general still can't get tests.  Remember when we were supposed to have drive through testing at Walmarts, CVS, and other areas? That evaporated and was swept under the rug like it was never mentioned. Months later you can count on 1 hand the number of drive through testing sites in this state.
Testing asymptotic persons is not advised unless they are at high risk or in contact with those at high risk. Testing asymptotic people would lead to a very high number of false positives.
It works. Just click on show a larger map. Then every time you touch the counties you can see the cases and deaths.
Your point?
It isn't a great UI.  You need to click on the blue flag icon, then the  little arrow on right.  Or, click on the area next to the flag and it should highlight that specific zipcode. This is probably the easier of the two ways.
I'm seeing case and death stats when I hover over the different ZIPcodes.  I've got Chrome, if that helps.
But then you can click on the county and it will give them to you.
The number of active cases and total cases simply isn't that different this early in the pandemic.
Because it doesn't fit the narrative of terrifying everyone into submission.
Several weeks since the beginning of the outbreak and a relatively slow doubling rate in NC for the past several weeks?  It was just an intuitive assumption but I think my point stands on it's own. Cases reported in March are not relevant to the current state of new infections.  So continuing to report on total infections doesn't help people understand where we are today.
There may be a flaw in this logic if you are assuming that an increased # of cases corresponds to an increased number of positive people.
Do you know how the asymptotic tests are being distributed? My doctor(Raleigh) has it but my bosses doctor (Cary) doesn‚Äôt have it yet.
From what i have seen a high percentage of people without symptoms are testing positive; people who would be spreading it around it they did not know.   False positives are the result of poor tests
NC needs to get on their game. Can‚Äôt be behind on info like this.
Thanks for the heads up!
Not sure I follow. The primary goal of the lockdowns is so the hospital system is not overwhelmed. So your overall number doesn't matter as much as concurrent cases.  Per CO this morning: "Two-thirds of the people who tested positive have since met CDC guidelines to be released from isolation. That rate is higher than the rate reported on April 27, when county officials said nearly half of people diagnosed with COVID-19 had recovered and been released from isolation."
The percentage of recovered is still quite small.  That data is important because,since we are just at the beginning of this, the change in the total number of cases is important as well as the total number of cases as a percentage of our total population.      Again, it's important to be clear on where we are in this - this is the beginning.  The big question is how close are we to the end of the beginning as we settle in to understand how long the first outbreak is going to last and as we start early planning for the next wave in six months.
Does your use of positive mean currently symptomatic?  If so you are misunderstanding how antibodies/herd immunity work.
I do not know what criteria the are using for prescribing a test.
Even the best test and testing procedure results in a very large number of false positives. Dr Birx explains this well . Posting this again in case you did not happen to see it.  https://www.bing.com/videos/search?view=detail&mid=E4F2624ED162F9745126E4F2624ED162F9745126&shtp=GetUrl&shid=57fc9da7-0a3e-4e37-9775-f4e81ab176ee&shtk=RHIgQmlyeCAtIEhBTEYgb2YgQ292aWQgdGVzdHMgdGhhdCB0ZXN0IHBvc2l0aXZlLi4uYXJlIGZhbHNlLXBvc2l0aXZlcw%3D%3D&shdk=RHIgQmlyeCAtIEhBTEYgKG9yIG1vcmUhKSBvZiBDb3ZpZCB0ZXN0cyB0aGF0IHRlc3QgcG9zaXRpdmUgYXJlIGxpa2VseSB0byBiZSBmYWxzZS1wb3NpdGl2ZXMuIGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlvdXR1YmUuY29tL3dhdGNoP3Y9R2ROLS0xMWJ0YzAgQXByaWwgMjA6IFVTIEFEVklTT1IgRHIgRGVib3JhaCBCaXJ4IHN0YXRlZCB5b3UgY2FuIG5vdCBhc3N1bWUgdGhlIENvdmlkIHRlc3QgcG9zaXRpdmUgcmVzdWx0IGlzIGNvcnJlY3QgLSBpdCBpcyBsaWtlbHkgdG8gYmUgd3JvbmcgbW9zdCBvZiB0aGUgdGltZSAtIGEgImZhbHNlIHBvc2l0aXZlIi4gU2hlIHNheXM6ICJJZiB5b3UgaGF2ZSAxJSBvZiB0aGUgLi4u&shhk=WE4Nzvy8HrqrYJh1KjvoQSiaZyYQJt%2FonxhHTSM7NdU%3D&form=VDSHOT&shth=OSH.VMt3Ui8hxFeVJWjjf6RyBA
>NC needs to get on their game. Can‚Äôt be behind on info like this.  SC just opened the state up and they haven't even hit their peak yet...    Check back in 2 weeks, ok?  Then we'll see who's "behind"......
My point is that testing is increasing, including symptomatic and asymptotic individuals. This greatly increases the counted number of ‚Äúcases‚Äù with no direct correlation to an increase in transmission or increase in actual infected individuals in a population.
Theoretically as more people in the population get it whether symptomatic or asymptomatic, the less people will potentially be able to get it, so it‚Äôll slow down...eventually.    I know we‚Äôre not to the point of testing every person, but it‚Äôs still good to keep track of numbers.  There will be correlations.

Revenue decline due to COVID-19 depletes NCDOT cash reserve

I‚Äôm over here typing a sympathy letter on the world‚Äôs tiniest computer.
Imagine that.

Outer Banks locals welcoming non-resident property owners back after ban due to COVID-19

Nothing wrong with this but the area hospitals and clinics probably can‚Äôt handle an influx of Covid patients.   I hope they‚Äôre giving thought to the the local community, resources and citizens. before they visit.
Good if they pay taxes and own property there they have every right to be there.
>I hope they‚Äôre giving thought to the the local community, resources and citizens. before they visit  if they were they'd still be back in new jersey at home
The reason they're reopening is because there is excess hospital capacity.   I own some property on the other side of the state, in a rural county that has seen a total of 20 cases so far. No deaths, and at least 5 have recovered. Many of the cases are people who didn't know they even had it (no symptoms) and they're isolating at home and not the hospital. As far as I know, none of the infected people are actually in the hospital now, they are regularly reporting their symptoms to doctors over the phone.  I totally understand the initial precautions, but if governments are using hard data to decide they have the hospital capacity to re-open stuff, then they should.   I chose to stay away from my place in WNC since this whole thing started because I didn't want to bring the illness with me or stress the hospital system if I got hurt or something. But at this point, I'm fine with going up there this weekend. I won't be going to the store or stopping for gas or anything there so I'll have zero contact with other people. I'm comfortable that I won't put any undue stress on the system or infect anyone if I have the virus and don't know it.
Seriously, can they not just wait until Memorial Day . We will know so much more and the area will be ready for the vacationers.
I get where you‚Äôre coming from and yeah, the last chart I saw didn‚Äôt show anything in mountains. In think the urban areas are contributing the most to the numbers.   Apologies in advance for my poor manners. I think I‚Äôm over reacting to the possibility of a rebound as more and more states begin to open.

Due to the high number of claims related to COVID-19, our phone lines are busier than usual. All of our call center agents are assisting other people and our hold queue is full.

What Restaurants are handing Covid-19 the best?
Thought it would be nice to put together a list of restaurants handling takeout/delivery the best as well as good/bad experiences.Try to keep them under single comments.
Musashis ( Havelock) - food was ready for pickup in 15 min. We ordered 6 rolls of sushi and 2 hibachi plates.
Zaxby's (Wilson) - Got in and out in the drive-thru with a mobile order a few weeks ago fine. 5/1 I spent 45+ mins waiting until I finally flagged someone down and asked (politely) WTF was going on.  System seems to be hastily thrown together.
Texas roadhouse in greensboro is pretty good. Has good deals as well
Wake Forest  Over The Falls -  Great variety of food with roadside pickup outside the front of the restaurant.  Mellow Mushroom - Top-notch pizza.  Numbered parking spaces outside.  Call inside when you arrive for pickup, tell them the number of your space and they bring it to your car.
Mcdonalds in Cameron is delivering now, I live less than 3 miles away too. Been digging the delivery McDonalds, never thought we would see it here.   Zaxby in Cameron is on point with it, they shortened hours to close at 9pm, but their wings are on point with no one in the lobby to disturb them.
Govt cheeseburger, Clubhouse/ ashley Christensen, St roch, Union special
Zaxbys and Krispy Kreme in Goldsboro have what seems to be a 2 mile long wait at the drive thrus for orders. I think they're just overwhelmed at the moment.

And it‚Äôs killed 11,848 as of 9:07 PM, WITH a stay at home order in place. Stop diminishing the lives of others lost by comparing it to a virus we DO know about. It‚Äôs not the flu, please focus on something other than ignorance.  Edit: Sorry I misspoke...11,848 are the confirmed cases in NC. 76,513 have died in the US...my point still stands.

Jesus. Are you purposefully ignoring the fact that the numbers for this are that high DURING STAY AT HOME ORDERS? That has limited the spread and deaths. None of your items you're using for your inaccurate comparisons had that.

It's basic logic. Less exposure to infected = less new infections.  Are you seriously arguing this point?

>but its going to take many more lives than it saves.  You have 0 data to support this.  Also I am not oversimplifying it. Are you arguing the point that quarantine prevents spread?  Also you point out more people will catch the virus after things open back up. So then are you going to toss out your "It's not quite a bad flu level of problem" that you made originally?

So as far as data goes, you've presented on link from referencing a model created by 4 actuaries, a single economist and 1 doctor in South Africa. It's presented on a site that if you scroll down just a bit has headlines like **"Professor Lockdown‚Äôs Mistress is a Pro-Greta Virtue Signaling Lefty"**,  so it would be fantastic if you had a less biased and peer reviewed source. BTW, the "data" was reviewed by an attorney, not another doctor, not another economist.  Your second link, directly states that cancer patients are avoiding hospitals over fear of catching the disease. That would have been the case regardless of the stay at home orders and restrictions.

What restaurant is this so I can avoid the fuck out of it  > The owner of our restaurant has been mocking people for wearing masks at work  what a fucking clown, yall should organize and refuse to work unless they accommodate your health
I'm not sure about an official channel, but you can certainly name and shame. You can send a tip to a few of your local/regional media outlets to see if they do anything. Is the bullying/mocking frequent? Maybe you could record audio or video of it and send that in to the media.  EDIT: One of these links with the Department of Labor may be helpful to you for reporting: https://www.labor.nc.gov/contact/file-complaint (presumably the "File a Safety and Health Complaint Report" option)  I don't know, but I'm sorry you're dealing with that. It's irresponsible for an owner of a restaurant to mock people who are just trying to keep others (and themselves) healthy. Maybe tell your coworkers to file a complaint as well if they want to.
Go to the local news, the local residents need to be aware of this before they get food from here and then get sick.
The state is definitely going to need to establish some guidelines on whether can be forced back to work -- there should be an exception for anyone showing symptoms and most people probably agree that no one should lose their unemployment if they'd rather stay home until the CARES Act runs out -- but whether or not the restaurant owner is doing right, if your friends are showing symptoms, why not get a test?  Edit: Oh, I see... Though there has been a lot of [talk](https://www.newsobserver.com/news/coronavirus/article242597001.html) about expanding the testing as the state moves toward Phase 1, those qualifying for testing may still be very [limited](https://www.newsobserver.com/news/coronavirus/article242532121.html) in NC.
Only one way to deal with a bully...
Talk to a pro bono lawyer?  https://www.legalhelpline.info/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwhtT1BRCiARIsAGlY51IGm-kF4S5tagVKrSm947e6VnlXsmZZ8wOr1ymTM2BAryVxZWNt1FsaAnF8EALw_wcB   Number is tel:+18885136561  file a class action suit? Idk
County health department is probably a good start.
Perhaps start with the Department of Labor and your county health department.
Unless they have a medical professional‚Äôs directive to self-quarantine due to virus or symptoms, they need to go to work or call out if they have sick time.  Once they have a doctor‚Äôs note, then it is mandated that they are to be paid for two weeks (up to 80 hours) on the company dime - there is a payroll credit for them out there.  I would suggest them getting a doctor‚Äôs note and problem is solved.
When you put money over the safety of your own employees. Smh. I would like to know the name of the restaurant also.
This is one of those times where we can give a concrete answer to the Randian rhetorical questiton "Why not let the free market handle it?"  We will catch and transmit the virus far and wide before our sense of ethics can catch up to our hunger for tacos.  The free market just isn't fast enough.
The public

It's amazing how some people see an employer as if they are being forced to work there.
This is it OP.  Power is given not taken. Don't give the owner power. You all will  need to have solidarity though, so hope everyone is on the same page.
All of you should strike together.. you‚Äôre more powerful that way.   Incase all else fails and you do decide to go in, make sure you‚Äôre masked up.   Check out The Peoples Mask they‚Äôre one of the only places in stock and actually shipping right away not in two weeks   www.thepeoplesmask.com
They told them that they can technically require people to come to work unless they have tested positive or are caring for someone who has tested positive, but it‚Äôs almost impossible to get tested here. They also fired another employee for being hesitant to come back to work right away because she lives with someone who is high risk. They have made comments about how we are all just trying to live off the government and they are frustrated and on a spree of lashing out at employees saying that they ‚Äúno one wants‚Äù to come to work. Just because it‚Äôs technically legal for them to require people to come to work with symptoms doesn‚Äôt mean do it. It‚Äôs crazy.   I definitely won‚Äôt be going out to other businesses when they reopen because this can be going on anywhere and you‚Äôd never know.    Also important to note that I have not been around my coworkers who are showing symptoms, this was all over the phone.
yeah I bet Cherie Berry is really gonna help
I will pass this along. I think these people are going to quit over this but it makes me feel uneasy returning to work knowing that they would do this. I would love to see them get reported to put a stop to it before we reopen for dine in. People who want to go out when things reopen need to realize that this could be going on anywhere.
No covid related posts allowed there for whatever reason
It's amazing if you don't go to work, you won't have a job and can't collect unemployment, oh and due to the market, can't get a new job.  So yeah 'forced' is a pretty accurate term.
Nobody thinks they are forced to work for their employer. But, when health insurance is tied to your job during the middle of a global health pandemic and jobless rates are off the charts, it's not such a crazy concept to demand common safety precautions be accessible (and not criticized) while at work.
Removed due to Rule 1.
Not only that, if you quit, you don't get unemployment, and no one is hiring. So yeah, basically is being 'forced' to work, especially when its unsafe conditions and the state isn't going to do a damn thing about it.   Look at the work Mark Cuban did in Texas, goes to show how much businesses will 'follow' the rules.
Not a lot of resturaunt servers have employer-provided health insurance and if they did, it would be easier for them to be privately tested.
Even if you don't get insurance, quitting means you get no unemployment.
As I said in another thread and was voted down for saying a few days ago, it really isn't clear whether a person would lose benefits for refusing to work.  If it wasn't covered by the Executive Order which suspended the work search requirement, the state could just declare an exemption and the intent of Congress with the CARES Act, which provides the entire benefit for people not covered by state employment, was that the money would be dispensed by the state until the end of July or until they go back to work. It doesn't say one would have to go back to work, which is why a couple of states have floated the idea of cutting off that benefit separately.  Until the Governor or Labor Commissioner says it, the idea that people must return to work or lose their unemployment has just been an assumption made by social media based on the rules before the pandemic. Someone needs to make an official say it.

Groups seek more protection for workers as COVID-19 cases at N.C. meat packing plants rise

Its about to get a whole lot worse Statewide

Wilkesboro Tyson Chicken plant shut down after COVID-19 outbreak

I actually used to work at that plant. Was maintenance. 7 days a week, ~10 hour shifts.   In a lot of places workers are practically on top of each other. Even when you aren't, to get anywhere you have to rub against each other with how congested it is in places.   I am Very glad I no longer worker there. It was a petri dish between employees even before COVID-19. They apparently didn't start doing temp checks until May 4th.
Meat processing plants are the American version of wet markets. They are cesspools of germs and all the employees are in very close quarters while working.
My parents live outside Wilkesboro.  Last week the total cases in Wilkes County was 24. Yesterday it was 197.
Prepare for more and more of these stories as other business start to reopen. Without mass testing and contact tracing we are going to see some huge outbreaks in factories.  Also just a reminder that the meat packing industry in the USA is awful. Its worse safety wise then back in the Jungle period because the industry primarily uses illegal immigrants now. Go watch the Netflix episode of dirty money on it.
Covid.stories could be the new."refinery is shut down for maintenance" reason for price increases
Music to my ears! Down with factory farming!
Fire and hire all day
I worked at the Claremont plant and that place was a nightmare. I wonder how that plant's doing right now...
Temp checks are essentially worthless.
Can you guesstimate the percentage of employees on the floor who were probable migrants or immigrant workers?   I remember visiting a chicken processing plant down east and the number of migrant/ immigrant labor had to be in the high 90's.
As bad as the meat processing plants are‚Äîand they are very bad‚Äîthe Chinese wet markets are on another level.
I can guarantee that they're DRAMATICALLY more sanitary and higher grade. We've come a long way since The Jungle was written, those peoples haven't.
That's not why wet markets are dangerous. It's because of the variety of animals, often kept alive all mixing and interacting to create a transmission pathway. Exotic and wild animals are kept and butchered there without any kind of sanitation or containment. Blood, waste, etc. Of hundreds of animals all lumped together in a petri dish. Especially bats, birds, pigs which are the usual suspects when it comes to viral transmission into people.  Meat processing plants are just crowded indoor environments. They're covered by hundreds of sanitation regulations.  They are not the same.
So you think that rejoicing over the fact that a billion dollar company is putting every single worker at the plant at risk of contracting a possibly deadly disease is an appropriate response? Even if you‚Äôre against factory farming- your game plan is to murder the hourly paid employees that work at a plant rather than fighting the problem at the source? You really are living the most pathetic life possible, aren‚Äôt you? Not only are you an idiot, you‚Äôre a lazy idiot who doesn‚Äôt actually want to put in the work to change something that they define as wrong. You‚Äôre a fucking pathetic excuse for a human being. Go play in traffic.
It's a screening step that we have available. Given how short on those we are right now I'd say it is not worthless at all. It's just not sufficient on its own.
Hell, Duplin, Wayne, and Sampson counties have a huge Haitian population who mainly work in food processing plants.
60-80% I think. Could be off by a lot with second generation making me think first and vice versa
May I ask why this matters?
The Jungle was a work of fiction though. Sinclair readily admitted that and was only attempting to point out the exploitation of the workers.  But regardless, that is why I called them American versions. However, just look at how many of these plants are hotspots of this virus. And in fact, are some of the largest in the nation.   Recent lawsuits are pointing out official company policies like ["one surgical mask a week"](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/6882078/Smithfield-Clean.pdf) and bonuses for workers coming to work even if they are showing symptoms of illness.  President Trump‚Äôs April 28 executive order invoking the Defense Production Act to order meat processing plants to stay open only encourages this bad behavior. Companies like Smithfield are pushing for the lawsuits to be dismissed in light of the order, without any acknowledgement of the working conditions or the threat of disease transmission to the workers and the local community.

Er, I'm rejoicing in the fact that the plant has shut down. Much like I rejoice at the decrease in air pollution due to lockdowns. It's possible to appreciate the positive outcomes of negative events.  Also, not that I have any reason to justify myself to you, but my career is dedicated to enabling a transition to clean energy and a sustainable model of civilization. I've been vegetarian for 14 years. Why do you automatically assume I don't put in any work?  Maybe eating a vegetable once in a while would help you think more clearly ;)
Um, the plants closed. Workers aren‚Äôt in danger if they aren‚Äôt at work anymore.  Factory farming is abhorrent and it is sad so many people are just fine with ‚Äúdon‚Äôt see don‚Äôt worry about it‚Äù mindset.
Even on its own, if you are worker that is infected and have a temp the damage is done.    The fact that it's being used as a tool is the problem.  If you can't tell if someone has or can reasonably not spread Covid19 then you should not be operating.    This is a situation where money is taking priority over health.
I'm not getting on a plane without a covid test for everyone on that fucking plane.
I just wired up a new addition to the Case plant in Wayne co.  The majority of the people I talked to in the existing building barely spoke english.
A lot of workers carpool and/or live together, so in addition to sharing a workplace, they‚Äôre quite literally always together.  Which means nothing more than faster spread if one household or carpool member gets sick and doesn‚Äôt know it.   For example, I interviewed and hired former Tysons employees who were refugees, living in Guilford.  They all lived  in the same apartment complex, I assume to aid in their transition to the US.  Always easier when you can talk to someone with your same language and culture, you know?  A lot of these refugees had degrees and skills from their home countries that couldn‚Äôt translate to the US so easily, like being an engineer or teacher.  So they start at the bottom, with these awful low-paying jobs, like meat processing.  Carpooling ~2 hours a day for $10/hour.  Just awful.  But anyway, it doesn‚Äôt at all surprise me that the caseload has gotten out of hand, especially given this virus can be asymptomatic.  You could spend hours in the car with someone who has no idea, and now all 4 of you are sick‚Äî to say nothing of possibly spreading it at work.  Not sure what the PPE is like there, but it sounds like they didn‚Äôt reduce density.
A lot of the people who work in the meat plants do qualify for health insurance,  paid time off, etc. Unfortunately,  if they feel sick, they are more likely to go to work because there's also no unemployment insurance. Couple that with often times living in crowded housing and this is a recipe for disaster.  I think federal legislation needs to mandate that all these people have health insurance,  PTO, and unemployment insurance.
They'll be less likely to seek care, which will lead to further spread and worse cases
It also ensure the citizens don't starve to death. Everything's a balance, nothing can be made 100% safe. That information being made available just assists in other agencies' abilities to emplace more layers of safety controls. It is what it is. Try to keep yourself safe as an individual and your family is our lot.
Fair enough; your comment seemed like it was saying that the event as a whole was an overall good thing (including all the negative side effects of such) not as a ‚Äòfinding a silver lining‚Äô kind of thing.
As per the article, It‚Äôs only ‚Äúshut down‚Äù until it‚Äôs cleaned and sanitized.  Will be back open on Tuesday.
I agree with you entirely. My faith in this country to respond to this disaster in any meaningful way from this point on has been completely smothered. I only expect things to get worse as the virus continues to get normalized in the publics mind.
Why wouldn't there be unemployment insurance for them? This site seems to imply that the requirements for unemployment insurance are very low: https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/collecting-unemployment-benefits-north-carolina.html
You won‚Äôt starve to death without meat, for the record.
Their comment in no way implied anything other than not supporting factory farming. You literally called them ‚Äúa pathetic excuse for a human being‚Äù and indicated they should play in traffic.   It comes off as extremely aggressive and quite frankly doesn‚Äôt even make sense. If someone says ‚Äúdown with factory farming‚Äù they‚Äôre indicating the whole industry is abhorrent. Down with factory farms is literally supporting the workers who are being asked to work in unsanitary conditions.   You should perhaps think a little bit longer before wishing death on someone.
The virus has undoubtedly exposed our faults as a nation and of our federal government.  I've never thought about leaving until now.
I cant seem to find anything saying one way or the other but i suspeect you have to be legal to work in order to collect unemployment?  If thats corrrect it would put a lot of the folks in that line of work in tough spot. You see you cant prove you worked if you were working under a bs ssn. Employers in that kind of industry are knoown to overlook clearly fake documents to get the worker. Now go try and collect unemployment with those same documents that were good enough to get you hired and find yourself SOL becausse they are bogus.   I have no idea if thats true or not but it sounds just like the way we would do things.
Yea idk what they are talking about workers at this plant will surely qualify for UI benefits in NC. Now whether or not they will properly navigate the online application process is another story and who knows in that regard.
Very true, that's granted - as of now, in present reality, it's a main staple in human and domestic pet food. Just because something can be doesn't mean there's a pre-existing infrastructure for it to be. Why don't most people understand things aren't simple and are layered in gives and takes?
Correct infrared Temperature checks with correct procedure can do alot of good. Obviously it isn't a cute but it most certainly is better than nothing.
I worked in the front office for a large construction company in eastern NC during college and we would have 10+ employees using the same SSN and fake ids. Of the 200+ employees, 60% (rough guesstimate) were using fake documentation. They also took 15-20 exemptions on their W2 which netted them pretty much $0 in tax payments. Claiming UI wasn‚Äôt option for them and, honestly, it shouldn‚Äôt be because they intentionally didn‚Äôt pay into the system.
> workers at this plant will surely qualify for UI benefits in NC  are you sure?  what if they used forged documents to get the job? They cant prove they worked because they were working under a bogus work id or ssn so they cant collect. They would see it taxes taken out of the paycheck but never able to collect on any of the benifits.
As much as I‚Äôd love it, no one is expecting the whole world to go vegan. However eating meat 3x a day is not necessary, let alone every day of the week. The benefits would be undeniable if people consumed much less meat. Yes, other yields such as corn, grains, vegetables would need to increase. But that could be done if we weren‚Äôt using so much to feed cattle.   Sadly I doubt factory farming will ever be banned...until it‚Äôs too late. The world will overpopulate if we continue at the rate we‚Äôve been increasing, so at some point folks will have to choose between feeding and watering their cattle versus feeding and watering their family.
It's good for determining you are already fucked.     That's like saying a missed period is a good way to determine if your pregnant and should stop drinking/smoking.
I get that they should not qualifly for UI because they are working under using fake documents. (is it really a big secret many of them are using bs documents?  its not) I guesee my point is that the documents are good enough for the employeer to hire them but then they get screwed when it time to try and collect the unemployment because the folks checking documents then are not motivated to let forged stuff slide. Its really unfair to all except the employer.   I would love it if they could prove they had been working and show the documents they used to get the job and then the state could then fine the employers for hiring them withoout proper documents and then use the fines to compensate those folks some. They work thier ass in those places in nasty work conditions and we are just gonna toss them to side lie a used kleenex when shit gets tough.
Now you‚Äôre making a bunch of odd baseless assumptions or questions rather. I‚Äôm saying just solely based off the plants closing due to covid19 they will qualify for NC DES UIB hands down no doubt. Now if they aren‚Äôt legally working there then who knows what is gonna happen, but technically if you‚Äôre using forged documents or rather stolen documents then just declare UIB in the other persons name. As long as the other individual isn‚Äôt working somewhere else or any other reason that NC DES can see then yea sure of course you‚Äôre gonna get declined.   But Like I said, simply going off them having been employed at the plant and now the plant closing because of Covid-19 they will qualify. Now who knows if it‚Äôs worth it to apply who knows. Given that the mandatory one week waiting period has been waved in NC, even if the plant shuts down for only 2 weeks (lets be real these places won‚Äôt shut down for long, they will wait for people to pass the quarantine period and then start monitoring employees from there, likely won‚Äôt open up at full capacity but definitely will be operating at some capacity) that means they will likely earn around $1800 from NC DES UIB with the federal money boosting it, but they won‚Äôt see it until the end of week 2 or start of week 3 since the process isn‚Äôt that bad in the decent amount of cases I‚Äôve seen recently.
You are absolutely right. As soon as a missed period happens a test should take place and after that, pregnant women should stop drinking and smoking. We don't have perfect knowledge 100% of the time. We work with what we can. Stop having your head in the sand....
You! Yes, you there, you logical son of a bitch!  Don't leave us. Who will be our voice of reason when you go?
As a 20 year old college student it wasn‚Äôt my call to fire them. I brought up the discrepancies when I was organizing the Hr files and was told to drop it, with a hint that I would be fired if I kept bringing it up. They knew what they were doing and banked on never being caught.
The documents weren‚Äôt good enough for an employer to hire them. The employer was literally aiding these workers by providing false documentation and filling out forms on their behalf.   They‚Äôll never be able to receive Ui because they aren‚Äôt here legally. Regardless of how hard they work, there have to be rules and consequences for breaking them.
The Senate would never pass anything like this, but it's that easy for the House. They can posture and put out a bill that does this, but even their "compromise" bill has no chance of passing, yet they still didn't. Instead, we get a complicated system of tax credits.
>  then just declare UIB in the other persons name.  I dont think its that easy is it? I have never collected unemployment so i dont know. Doesnt the state actully check documentation to make sure it is really the correct peerson and that the work id or ssn matches? the state is gonna be motivated to spot the fake stuff where the employeer is motivated to ignore it because they want the cheap labor and the feds almost  never crack down or fine employeers for doing a poor job on checking documents for the i-9   See comment from the other person who knew the documents were fake but they overlooked it.
A temp check is too little too late for worker protection.  Why is people going to work to potentially die and infecting others ok with you?     This virus is invisible and doesn't give a shit about a thermometer.
I'm not blaming you directly, but for all the people complaining about this happening and blaming the 'illegal workers', much of the blame can be placed squarely on employers that have a gross disregard for regulations because they won't be held responsible.
I dont disagree.  shame we dont hold the employeers to rules and consequences for what they do in forging or overlooking clearly fake documents.   Finding news of an employer getting fined or jailed for i-9 violations is like finding a unicorn.  I have seen it myself.  I once got some part time work for beer money. Grabbed my passport to prove ssn and that i could work so they can fill out the i-9 like they are supposed to. They never looked at it  I know because when i got home to put my passport away i saw i grabbed my wifes passport. I dont look like my wife. They didnt care.  they just wanted to say they did the paperwork and get a cheap worker.
I mean if he‚Äôs working under stolen documents then I wouldn‚Äôt doubt he‚Äôs using them elsewhere in life wouldn‚Äôt you? Like if you don‚Äôt have a SSN but have a SSN for someone the same sec as you that is unused I‚Äôd just use that one everywhere. And if they have been using it then no problem at all.  And I don‚Äôt know what the states normal checking process is like but right now it‚Äôs basically fast track approve all covid-19 related cases now and deal with the fall out and collect from those who have defrauded them at a later date.
I completely understand why you believe in worker protection. The reality is that the country is generally beginning to open up. I dont completely agree with that as well but Infrared Temperature checks with correct procedure can go a long way to protecting workers.     Do seat belts 100% guarantee the safety of passengers in a car? Absolutely not. But its at least does something.  We are constantly doing a cost basis analysis on our decisions, lets have temp screenings to better help workers who have decided that it would be best for them to go back to work.   Whats wrong with that?
"wouldn‚Äôt you? Like if you don‚Äôt have a SSN but have a SSN for someone the same sec as you that is unused I‚Äôd just use that one everywhere."    Hell no i would not. not a lot of risk in working using bs documents. trying to claim Unemployment or collect ssi or other shit using them draws way more attn that they for sure dont want.  Itss not a ssecret that employers dont fill out i-9s right and often dont keep them like they are supposeed to and the only time the feds will check i-9s is if the emloyer makes a deal with the feds because the employees start making noise about unions or osha violations so they turn the info over to ice and like majik they get raided, folks deported, employer never get prosucuted and three weeeks later they are doing the same thing with a new batch of folks.   I suspect many working under bs documents are not using them for anything other than working in order to stay hidden and out of sight of the state or fed. They know the employers dont care. most times the employeer is pointing them the right way to get the fake documents or like some otheer person mentioned the employer is the one making up the ssn or documents.
People's lives > money.  Going to work to die is bullshit.
This doesn't even factor in how employees at Amazon facilities are taking Tylenol/Advil at the right interval before coming into work to make sure they have a "legit" temp, since Amazon is only paying a 3/4 day for a sick day. Companies need to step up!
It depends for every person that uses bogus documentation once there is someone that uses it for everything. Sure if I‚Äôm using stolen information to just lay low I will use it only once, but if I‚Äôm using stolen information because it‚Äôs all I have then I‚Äôm probably better off trying to fully assume the life of the person I‚Äôve stolen rather than to take a sovereign citizen like approach and try to stay hidden or something.
Completely understand but until we live in the Communist Utopia and not under capitalism, this equation is a bit different. Good luck brother.

More than 800 cases of COVID-19 at 19 NC food and meat processors

How many are symptomatic vs asymptomatic?  I had a coworker get sick at my job, and we quarantined him along with a few others (who are now back to work).  So far no one else has gotten it that we know of, but I wonder how many of us just had an asymptomatic infection.
What is it about meat plants
We should open the state!  /s
Good time to go vegan.
We need to test more and unfortunately, the Federal Government is not leading the way to mobilize said testing (positive, negative, antibody, etc)
Mostly that they work in really close quarters, lots of people lined up shoulder-to-shoulder on either side of a conveyor belt.
The NPR podcast ‚ÄúEmbedded‚Äù did an episode last week on the South Dakota Smithfield Plant and Covid-19 I would recommend. But in summary the nature of the job invoked people being close quarters cutting up meat. The company promised a bonus to employees that didn‚Äôt miss any days in an attempt to keep their normal levels of production. But even if an employee fell ill they could still get this bonus which wasn‚Äôt properly explained to the employees. Many of whom were immigrants and were afraid to lose their jobs. Employees weren‚Äôt told who or how many of their coworkers were testing positive or falling ill. There seemed to be some level of ignorance of middle management who weren‚Äôt taking the virus as seriously as their superiors (Fake news, out to get Trump, it‚Äôs just the flu etc.). And even when the plant was supposed to close down for a 3 day cleaning there were employees being assisted shifts during the closure. The Republican mayor of the city basically had to step in and tell them to completely shut down. In many ways a complete lack of adaptability and management failures. I can‚Äôt say for certain that similar things are happening at our meat plants but it wouldn‚Äôt be surprising.
You should really put a /s on the end of that. You know, lest someone think you're a fool.
[The federal government is hijacking and hording supplies from state governments](https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2020-04-07/hospitals-washington-seize-coronavirus-supplies) while [Jared Kushner is the one deciding how to divvy it all up.](https://www.npr.org/2020/04/04/826922646/jared-kushners-role-in-coronavirus-response-draws-scrutiny-criticism)    I wish I were kidding.
This is accurate. I applied at a chicken plant once, took a tour, but didn't take the job.  It's a very open environment for people moving around (though most people have to stay in a certain area for their task). Things are always moving, people are receiving, passing, shipping out, etc.   People themselves are indeed, shoulder to shoulder, and once you get used to your job--if you're in a part that isn't obnoxiously loud, you start conversations.  Not to mention, if you're in a obnoxiously loud part of the factory, lunch and break times are your times to socialize--which people do by huddling around break rooms or cafeterias, again, shoulder to shoulder.
My SO is a contractor that works in meat processing plants. To add to what you were saying, these companies have to keep running to keep the food supply up. So where he is, if workers are testing positive but are asymptomatic they return to work. They are given PPE (goggles, masks, face shields) when they work. This has to be another reason why it's hitting these plants hard. Breakrooms have been changed to enforce 6 ft distancing measures. All employees have been given an extra $150 a week in hazard pay, so most of them want to keep working.   The plant he's at (out of state) has now been deemed a hotspot for Covid and everyone is being tested. I'm really hoping his test comes back negative. He's been gone for 5 weeks out there and I just want him home. I've been so worried.
Thanks
Poe's Law strikes again
Is it not also a chilled environment to preserve the meat?  Which would also preserve virus strands for longer periods of time.
I think this virus has shown to not care for what temperature its exposed to (possibly because it's just jumping from host to host so fast). Viruses naturally can't last too long outside the body.  But yes, anything with a dying lifespan can stay a little more 'alive' in colder environments since it reduces decay time. Don't quote me on that, I'm not a biologist.  I think more than anything, it's just people being so close to each other for long periods of time. We're talking 6-7 hours while working (some people most likely breathing heavily from work strain), and then an extra hour during breaks.  The people you work with might be different people you see on break, further allowing the spread of the virus.  EDIT: I also want to add a very important detail; like many factories, they're probably pretty loud places. This means almost anytime you want to tell someone something, you get really close to their face--a great move for passing the virus.

Many of North Carolina's restaurants may permanently close because of COVID-19

I'm hopeful that once the economy turns around and the cycles of lock down are over we'll have another burst of economic growth that really focuses in on local sustainability both in food/retail but also in the supply chain. To me a silver lining of this pandemic is that we've identified (very clearly) a lot of cases where globalization and big business are simply not the answer. Sure lawmakers may push for more of the same decisions that created our current challenges.. and I get that.. but just trying to think positive here. For me personally it's been eye opening how a situation halfway across the globe can literally bring life as we know it to a stand-still. Other than 9-11 we haven't had anything like this in my lifetime (maybe WWII was the most recent prior to that?).   I guess my point is that it's awful that these restaurants are closing and I hate the incredible hardship that entrepreneurs and restaurateurs are facing BUT there will always be a need and market for smaller locally-owned restaurants. I think out of the ashes of this dumpster fire we'll end up with a new round of amazing places to grab a bite and for that I'm hopeful. Let's be honest, there's simply no way we'll be content eating at that Darden-owned Italian joint forever...
So sad. Just gives chain restaurants a tighter grip on the local economy.
Eat at home I guess. I'm not going to garbage chains even if there is no alternatives, we're learning to cook better
Dang y‚Äôall gotta list maybe I can grab something to eat there rather than a fast food place üòî.
Yes, it is really sad.  However, they need to reinvent themselves.  Most people want family meals and on the cheap.  I have seen many scale back their menus and offer this.  In addition, many are selling supplies.  Paper goods, meats, and vegetables.  Knowing who your customer is and marketing to them.  This economy is rough on all of us, even those with jobs.
Have 6 months saved or you are a loser, they said.  Guess we have too many restaurants, if they closed that fast. Where's their 6 months? My old restaurant boss used to smugly tell us we should have 6 months saved. Hope he took that advice.  Anyways, cook at home. The restaurants are making all of you fat and unhealthy.
That sucks. North Carolina is already full of franchises. There are hardly any unique mom & pop restaurants left.

Yeah. As happens when a PLAGUE presents itself. Those who deny the reality DIE and get replaced by others. Have a nice day.
And people on this sub want to stay closed longer. Crocodile tears...
I actually don't think that globalization is under threat due to the pandemic. If anything, the pandemic shows that we are in this together. Also, take businesses for example - is it really the small restaurant that is thriving now or is it GrubHub, Uber Eats and DoorDash?
It's a damn shame that of the billions of dollars going to businesses, very little is going to make it to the businesses that need it the most.
No quite. It also leads to new opportunity for new restaurants to open. Similar things happened during 2008.   Currently big restaurants (chains) are often suffering similar issues, especially someone like Cheesecake Factory is hurting hard right now.
The garbage chains are the ones that will survive.  They can take more losses.
6 months will be August.
Look up the Spanish Flu epidemic of 1918-1919. Same thing is gonna happen if we open up too soon.   These buisnesses should have been given substantially more assistance by the government, same for individual citizens. The current administration has created this situation by bailing out large, irresponsible corporations with no oversight, which then lead to furloughed employees and bonuses for upper management.  Do we need to open up to keep the economy going? Absolutely, folks have to eat. But it needs to be slower to reduce the chance of a worse second round in the fall.
Um, we reopened last weekend.
Have you seen the chart floating around showing how busy restaurants in GA, TX, and TN are now? Might as well stay closed.
You sad fool.
This is bad and all but I think preventing more mass death is a higher priority than keeping small businesses open. I don't believe most business is worth sacrificing lives
I didn't say that globalization is under threat - I said we've identified cases where relying too heavily on the global economy has negative impacts on our ability as a nation to react and overcome situations like this. PPE is a tremendous example where relying heavily on global sources has created bottlenecks and unnecessary stress.   Also I have no clue what you're talking about with the small businesses - I don't know of any small restaurants that are "thriving" right now. Most are struggling to stay afloat and that's the entire point of the article OP linked...
Every stimulus the state does should require at least 20% of the small business money goes to local restaraunts
I agree.
I think this is much, much harsher than 2008. And really no end in sight tbh with Covid possibly being around for quite a while.  Well who knows? It does depend on who you talk to or what you read. It seems like our only ways out are 1) herd immunity and/or 2) vaccine. Who knows the timeline on either of those.
This is true as well.  A lot of Morehead City staples closed in 2008 and other and better restaurants popped up in their place. Southern Salt, Ruddy Duck, Floyd's 1927 and Parrott's on 11th all took the place of former establishments and upped the game.
I guess that's a good way to look at it. Hopefully the local restaurant scene bounces back soon, we have such a good one here. As much as I love local restaurants I still definitely have a place in my heart for the big ones like Cheesecake Factory as you mentioned. I'd be bummed if that went away
In all honesty, I've thought for a while that the local restaurant market is way oversaturated. Back when I lived in Greensboro there was, no lie, over a dozen pizza places and about as many Chinese places in a two mile radius. I tried most of them and they all were surprisingly similar. And that's not counting the chains. It was a little absurd and you have to wonder how *any* of them made money.
Yeah, some of these national restaurant chains are going to be bought up by private equity, which will just gut them out and sell for scraps. If anything they're in more trouble (in some regards) than local chains

As a small business owner, I would argue that. I would love to feed my kids and not lose my house. Same for my 7 employees. How do you propose I do that if I can‚Äôt run my business?
Herd immunity is only from a vaccine. Also That's still a Maybe. Coronavirus immunity usually only lasts for a few months. So... A vaccine every few months? Unlikely. This is going to change the world.
RIP Ruddy Duck
You mean the rampant, unchecked greed of the upperclass, the total lack of social safety nets, and shortsightedness of the pro-big buisness republican party is going to tank the economy into damn near the stone age again?  Well, you're not wrong. However, you ignored the part where I said it should open up...but because you and people like you see anyone who varies slightly from your point of view as entirely against your point of view, you tried to come back with something that you felt could measure against the example I gave. And while it could if you were arguing with someone who said "keep it closed indefinitely", it falls flat because opening slowly and responsibly would prevent a second Great Depression and prevent thousands of needless deaths simultaneously.
And it also might happen if we *do* open up and things get worse.  Opening up isn't a magic fix.
Huh? I have been getting food from all of my favorite local restaurants ever since the quarantine started. None of them have closed.
Reopening still may not save a lot of them. With 6' distances required between tables that limits your total throughput on an evening. That combined with people reluctant to dine out will make it difficult to sustain, especially since most restaurants operate on razor thin margins to begin with.
That's IF the Governor and Dr. Cohen decide we are able to go to Phase 2.  I wouldn't be shocked if they extend Phase 1.  I'm hoping they do go to Phase 2 though...
prob not until later than that- I think it will be after Mem Day at earliest.
>Restaurants aren't opening until _at least_ May 22.  ftfy
How do you propose you'll keep people buying from your business if they're dead?  See how that works?  edit to build on that:  Imagine a war.  Your business is going to suffer because your country is being invaded.  The most pressing concern shouldn't be to ensure that you're open so that you can serve customers during the invasion, because the *invasion* is the threat to your business, not the closure.  Customers aren't going to feel comfortable walking in the street to get to your storefront if they're worried about being shot en route.  You are vulnerable to an erosion in consumer confidence.  If consumers don't feel comfortable spending money at your business, you will suffer and you won't be able to feed your family, *even if you are left to open and close at your leisure*.  A deadly pandemic will certainly make them worry enough to curb their spending.  Your best bet is to neutralize the thing that poses a threat to your *customers*, not the thing that poses a threat to *your freedom*.  If you hurry to open so you can pay your bills, but consumer confidence tanks because everyone is worried about catching a deadly virus, *you're still not going to be able to pay your employees or feed your family*.  Your business will suffer either way.  Kinda like in 2008 when the mortgage market collapsed and people had to worry about being underwater with their house payments, then all the ancillary businesses that *served* those people went under as well, *even if their own mortgages weren't at risk*, because folks lost confidence in the market en masse.    Whining and bitching about the inconvenience of the closure is like whining that your tablecloth is dirty at the restaurant on the Titanic.  There are bigger underlying threats to your success than the condition of the tablecloth, I can assure you.
Only a few months? This will ultimately the death of many if you‚Äôre life is at risk every two months.
Yeah I hate it.  I just hope something can come in and just offer up a good menu that appeals to everyone like Ruddy Duck did.

> Opening up isn't a magic fix.  making everyone wear masks would help more than anything else, with the current reopenings   Masks (at least the cloth ones) should be as easy to buy as getting a coke or cigarettes or moon pies or whatever. The availability of masks would help in getting more people to wear them
> None of them have closed.  The ones who own their own spaces are probably okay for now. Most of them are losing money by relying only on take out sales.

You still haven't responded to the fact that opening up won't magically prevent economic harm.  You've painted this as "reopen = good economy", and there's *very* little evidence that's actually true.  The economy might be garbage *regardless* of whether or not we open up, which means the choice is between high infection + job losses and low infection + job losses.
Yeah, I think it should be slow because this virus could kill hundreds of thousands, if not millions, more than the near 82,000 that we've already lost during a time of taking safety measures.  If we reopen slowly, will the economy hurt for a little bit? Absolutely. Will it recover? Absolutely.  If we reopen right now, full on, no stops, there will be at least 50,000-100,000 North Carolinians dead by this time next year. Nation wide, 100 million infected with potentially 2-3 million dead. And that, my friend, will kick off the Second Great Depression.  I want it to open up. I want people out and about spending money. I want my kid back in school and her extracurriculars and spending time with her cousins. I want this bullshit to go away...but it isn't. If we don't take our time and do the right thing, both what you fear and I fear will happen will indeed happen.  Dead people don't earn money.

> I don't think it's going to "magically" save the economy but I think it will save some businesses that are on the edge.  ....and a second wave will plunge others deeper into the red.  It could make things *worse*.  You're *still* glossing over that possibility.  Opening now won't magically save more businesses than a reckless opening would shutter.  > And we shouldn't have shut down to begin with, for a virus that is on par with a bad flu (deaths in the US from covid are roughly the same as deaths from flu in the 2017-2018 season).  The 2017-2018 flu season killed [61,099](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/2017-2018.htm).  Covid-19 has killed [79,756 people](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html) as of the writing of this comment.  Your talking points are already severely outdated.  > And unlike the Spanish Flu that you compared it to,   You have me confused with someone else.  > this is an old person's disease.  1. So you're just willing to let the elderly die?  Just like that?  2. "[These are staggeringly large increases in mortality risk, especially given that all the city‚Äôs Covid-19 deaths have occurred in less than two months. And they are risk increases for the entire population, not just those infected by the coronavirus. David Spiegelhalter of the Winton Centre for Risk and Evidence Communication at the University of Cambridge calculated estimates for the latter using U.K. mortality data and found that the resulting increases in annual mortality risk start at about 20% for boys under 10 and 30% for girls, then follow a similar pattern of being highest for those in their 50s, 60s and 70s, for whom being infected with the coronavirus appears to at least double their risk of dying in a given year.](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-05-07/comparing-coronavirus-deaths-by-age-with-flu-driving-fatalities)"  > The death rate for someone under 50 who catches the covid is 0.4%.

We should have focused our efforts on isolating at risk patients, especially at places like nursing homes  Again, you're completely ignoring the point I'm trying to make.  Starting from today, ignoring everything that has come before this point, there is a lingering possibility that a quick reopening re-ignites the spread of this disease.  It is very possible (and arguably likely) that by reopening we hasten a second, more dangerous wave of infections which will plunge us deeper into an economic crisis than we would be if we reopened gradually.    All those businesses you're worried about?  What do you think happens with them if we hurry to open up now and a second wave kills another 100,000+ people and further erodes consumer confidence?  Opening now doesn't stave off economic turmoil, it just *delays* it, and a strong case could be made that it *worsens the economic outlook*.  You could literally be arguing to make the economic impact *worse than it already is* because you've convinced yourself that this will all be fixed if we go back to the office.
> (deaths in the US from covid are roughly the same as deaths from flu in the 2017-2018 season)  precisely because we drastically changed everything about our normal lives and how our country operates. if we had done nothing we would have millions dead by now.

> You do love using the word "magically" to describe the effects I expect from this.  I'm not glossing over it. I just don't think that's going to happen.  Based on......what evidence?    > A strawman argument. I said that the elderly and and at risk were the ones we should have focused on the most. But keep in mind that the elderly are not the only people to be concerned about.   You literally said, "this is an old person's disease."  I don't know how else to interpret that except as a handwave away for the risk to every other age bracket.  Like the risk of [pediatric multi-system inflammatory syndrome in children](https://discoveries.childrenshospital.org/covid-19-inflammatory-syndrome-children/), which may be linked to a Covid-19 immune response.  > The shut down is going to cause plenty of deaths amongst the young from the socioeconomic conditions.  Yeah, and so is the virus.  You still seem to be suggesting that we can somehow *avoid deaths*.  That's literally how natural disasters work.  They kill people.  And sometimes the aftermath does too.  People die from the winds of the tornado and some die because thereafter they're homeless.    If we're needlessly pontificating about people who we *think* are going to die if we take action A or B, I can just as easily say we should expect "plenty of deaths among working-age individuals from a second wave of the virus".  You seem to be suggesting we should avoid death by choosing B over A.  Both A and B will suck.  You keep acting like B is going to save us from economic hardship, but it'll hurt pretty bad too.  > I don't know what this guy is going on about. Look at the data from NYC. 302 deaths in the 44 and under age range, of whom 244 had underlying conditions and 40 of whom it is unknown if there were underlying conditions. Representing about 4.5% of all covid deaths. (That's as of April 14th, but I don't expect the breakdown has changed). These are the actual deaths being reported, not some guys model of what might happen. Again, this is mainly an old persons disease (or more accurately, a disease mainly effecting people with underlying conditions, but that often goes hand in hand with being elderly).  There it is again.  The utter dismissal of the non-zero risk to everyone who isn't elderly and infirm.  Those people were living perfectly fine with their underlying conditions *right before the virus killed them*.  Are we supposed to dismiss the number of obese people who die in automobile accidents because their underlying health was already a problem before they died of rapid blood loss?  > Yes, it's possible. But I don't think its likely.  Color me utterly unconvinced.  That which can be asserted without evidence can be dismissed without evidence.  > I just don't believe that's going to happen. If I did I wouldn't be in favor of opening up.  Dr. Fauci is saying that [240,000 dead is a very real possibility in a second wave of this virus](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/04/scientist-predicts-coronavirus-return-fall-200401075606758.html).  The CDC says the fall/winter reemergence [will be more devastating because it'll happen at the same time as flu season](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/04/21/coronavirus-secondwave-cdcdirector/) which is already expected to kill between 20,000 and 60,000 people even *without* Covid-19.  You really should start expanding your repertoire of news sources beyond people who have an overt political interest in downplaying the risk to ensure their reelection.

Revised forecasts significantly increase NC death estimates for COVID-19 :: WRAL.com

I thought as much.
Uncertainty also increased by 7x in the revised model....so essentially the sharp increase is a possible outcome....among a list of other possible outcomes.
People aren't listening, nor do I think they will care to until the virus comes knocking on their own or a loved ones door.  I see it every day I go to work now and come home. A plethora of people on the road; lining up at stores en masse.  Again, people will take a mile for the inch given, consequences be damned.
I argued with a local friend about this today. She‚Äôs a #reopennc and #churchesareessential thinker. Her entire family protested in Raleigh today and made a point to take pictures with everyone she met. Those people are going to kill us all.
well that's not good.
Don‚Äôt forget folks, even if you survive (which you likely will) it can cause lifetime damage. It‚Äôs not a flu, it absolutely shreds your lungs and bronchial system.   Sure, a small number of people will die, but is it not pretty awful to be hospitalized by yourself for weeks at a time? And possibly face long lasting affects?
This seems ... not ideal.
There is almost no way this model isn‚Äôt flawed horribly. Texas, who is reopening quicker and has 5 times the population, is projected for half of the deaths.   No other model comes close to what this one does, something is clearly wrong here

Honestly, after Ferguson's shit show of a model Im done with models of this. Im treating this like a flu which it pretty much is unless you live in a nursing home.
Not surprising.
I hate how the press does such a crappy job of putting this sort of information into context.  Consider a place where scientists have been studying for decades and have created and refined elaborate predictive models:   Hurricane forecasts.   And, despite all that study and supercomputer time, the models used to forecast Hurricanes can have HUGE discrepancies in their forecasts.  We've all seen the spaghetti plots pointing in wildly different directions.  So, yeah, it's one study saying "a lot more North Carolinians will die."  That's bad.  But, let's look at other studies. Let's look at how predictive that model has been in the past.  And let's consider that this model doesn't have a whole lot of track experience with this virus.    Heck, why should we believe the current prediction from this model over its previous prediction?
Even though uncertainty is up, this really seems like an overfitting for the NC model, especially because they singled it out.  Either that or some weird input values.  Take Georgia for example, with an expected -28% mobility projected, but NC is -22% seems kinda wrong.  Also the mobility projected decrease -36% -> 22% is huge just over a 5 day period, May 7 - May 12.  And Georgia has had more deaths prior to today, yet as we are more cautious in opening, we're expected to surpass them?
I've been seeing a lot of people, including elected officials, focus on reopening churches. It's apparently not good enough to worship outside, they want to be *inside* a physical building. They're clamoring for it. People defend it and say, "well, if *you* don't want to be at risk, then don't go out." Meanwhile, a study of a choir was published today which states: "[The act of singing, itself, might have contributed to transmission through emission of aerosols, which is affected by loudness of vocalization](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/pdfs/mm6919e6-H.pdf?deliveryName=USCDC_921-DM28169)":  > On  March  17,  2020,  a  member  of  a  Skagit  County,  Washington,  choir  informed  Skagit  County  Public  Health  (SCPH) that several members of the 122-member choir had become ill. Three persons, two from Skagit County and one from another area, had test results positive for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Another  25  persons  had  compatible  symptoms.  SCPH  obtained the choir‚Äôs member list and began an investigation on March 18. Among 61 persons who attended a March 10 choir practice at which one person was known to be symptomatic, 53  cases  were  identified,  including  33  confirmed  and  20  probable cases (secondary attack rates of 53.3% among con-firmed  cases  and  86.7%  among  all  cases).  Three  of  the  53  persons  who  became  ill  were  hospitalized  (5.7%),  and  two  died (3.7%). The 2.5-hour singing practice provided several opportunities for droplet and fomite transmission, including members  sitting  close  to  one  another,  sharing  snacks,  and  stacking chairs at the end of the practice.
> Those people are going to kill us all.  Well, 1-3% of us depending on what numbers you look at.
A [case series of 29 patients with severe covid-19](https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-27359/v1?fbclid=IwAR35EDaKHbjBnANiVWb_fvVtsyhSVvzCBUdqjLJsdHYL00W1fO3H1lUch5I) was recently released in which they performed 3 months worth of follow-up CT scans. These scans showed the lung damage healed for most of the patients and mostly healed for the rest. This provides some strong evidence that the damage being done isn't necessarily lifetime, though it may take a while to fully recover.
Curious what the body count needs to be for you to no longer treat this ‚Äúlike a flu‚Äù
These models keep changing because you stupid asses keep pretending you're not the ones changing it when you go back out with no mask or care in the fucking world
Everyone knows you have to be seen worshiping or it doesn't count.
My wife is an episcopal priest and is pretty tuned into other churches - of all denominations.  She has weekly calls with all the head pastors/priests/rabbis in our area and none of them have any idea where this open churches up push is coming from.  None of them are looking to open soon.       Opening soon would present tons of problems.     1) many if not most parishioners/members are elderly, this means they are at risk or they are left out   2) the number of services required would be a great strain on clergy   3) cleaning involved in a number of services would be costly, exhausting, etc.   4) you are again, excluding people who don't feel comfortable, are at risk, etc from participating in the service, which would be a problem   5) the online participation is high - even among groups that would surprise you - like the elderly and shutins.     6) church isn't a business or the state and isn't obligated to open nor does it particularly help the economy to open     All this makes me think the pressure is entirely political - coming from a group that is looking for any thing to undermine the legitimacy of the stay at home orders.
So, first of all, that's not the title of the paper, which is " High SARS-CoV-2 Attack Rate Following Exposure at a Choir Practice ‚Äî Skagit County, Washington, March 2020."   Secondly, you're misstating the conclusion of the study:  " This underscores the importance of physical distancing, including maintaining at least 6 feet between persons, avoiding group gatherings and crowded places, and wearing cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain during this pandemic. "      The choir was, according to the paper, 6-10 inches away from each other and apparently not wearing masks.   It had 122 (!) members and its median age was 69.   So, it was basically a bunch of old people gathering close together and apparently not taking any precautions at all.  It's an interesting and potentially useful data point.  But, it hardly leads to the conclusion that indoor church services, with appropriate precautions, are inherently less safe than other indoor activities.  \[They may actually be less safe.  But, this paper doesn't prove that.\]
[Also](https://www.vox.com/2020/5/8/21251899/coronavirus-long-term-effects-symptoms)  We are in the early days of having any kind of understanding about the long term effects. What is certain, is that many survivors will experience them.
While it would be nice if the longterm effects were minimal, keep in mind a sample size of 29 is quite small.
If it started killing young/healthy people at a rate dramatically different from the flu. As it stands unless youre old or have serious comorbidities youre unlikely to have serious adverse reactions.
Which, hilariously enough, is [specifically counter to what the Bible says on the topic](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+6%3A1-5&version=NIV). Shocker.
> All this makes me think the pressure is entirely political - coming from a group that is looking for any thing to undermine the legitimacy of the stay at home orders.  Absolutely. I just watched the last recorded meeting of the county commissioners (all Republicans) where I live. They're coming up with a resolution to send to the Governor to let him know that they think small businesses and churches should be considered essential so they can reopen. One of the commissioners said this: "We've been having outside church and it's went well but we're ready go inside." My immediate thought in response to her comment was, "then what's the problem?!" -- if outside service is going well, good! Enjoy it! Continue with it for the time being!  Another one of the commissioners said the governor is "a dictatorship" after the county attorney tried to explain to the board the powers that the state/governor has during an emergency.  It's completely partisan.
> So, first of all, that's not the title of the paper  Luckily I didn't say, "this is the title of the paper‚Äù  >  Secondly, you're misstating the conclusion of the study  I didn't purport to share the conclusion, I shared a portion of details from the study that I thought were interesting. The "conclusion" you quote is what everyone has heard for the past two months. It isn't new. I posted information from a study in the context of functions that regularly take place in churches.  >  So, it was basically a bunch of old people gathering close together and apparently not taking any precautions at all.  Shocking. Thank goodness there usually aren't many old people in churches.  > It's an interesting and potentially useful data point.

But, this paper doesn't prove that.]  Thanks for the insights, Captain Pedant. I'm not a scientist or a journalist. I posted a comment on Reddit because I thought the paper was interesting and relevant.
Thanks for the non-answer. You do realize that you can spread the virus to people that are not young/healthy and that it can kill them, yes?
And that's not a random, cherry-picked passage either, it's from the sermon on the mount, and you don't have to read very far into the new testament to find it.
You edited your post since my comment.   As edited, it's a lot more balanced.
I could have done the same with the normal flu, MRSA, or any other number of potentially deadly viruses. Its just the way society works. I dont see the need to stop society from running for a virus with an IFR of like 1%.
Yes, and in the original post I didn‚Äôt claim that was the title. You read too much into it, so hopefully the edit prevents others from doing so.
There‚Äôs some key differences here. First of all, there‚Äôs a vaccine for the flu. Additionally there is an extremely high number of unknowns involved. There‚Äôs a reason the entire world ‚Äúclosed‚Äù and hint: it‚Äôs not a conspiracy.    So I‚Äôm assuming, you don‚Äôt wear a mask or keep 6-8 feet away from people during flu season so is it also safe to assume you won‚Äôt take any additional precautions for COVID-19?   I think my problem with this line of thinking is that it‚Äôs often packaged with the libertarian-lite argument ‚Äúif you‚Äôre at risk or scared stay home‚Äù (which is riddled with so many holes it might as well be a sieve). Is this your take on it as well?
The flu vaccine is only 50% effective and half the population at most gets it. Its not like it does much. I dont think its a conspiracy. When it was an unknown and the goal of not overwhelmong hospitals was the major concern I supported it. Now the goals have shifted, we know more, and hospitals are furloughing docs due to lack of patients.
 The North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services (NCDHHS) is searching for nurses and health care workers who are furloughed or laid-off to help in the fight and pick-up shifts.    This is CBS not me and if you want to do the fake news over reporting cases shit then we're not going to have a constructive conversation but if you look at what's CURRENTLY happening it's not what you're saying

UNC Health to discuss new syndrome related to COVID-19 attacking children

I have read about this on the u/Coronovirus sub. This virus hits all ages  The unsettling thing is it can create problems such that the deceased might never be counted as a Covid death. One side effect is hypoxia, low oxygen saturation in the blood. This can creep up on a person as the gradually find themselves taking more breaths per minute, and at some point it‚Äôs too late.   The virus can throw off blood clots leading to a stroke. This is a Covid death but it might simply be treated as death by stroke.   There are other things roaming around the internet about Covid but it‚Äôs safe to say; Put your mask on and keep your damn distance!
This makes me nervous....
No!

Typical fake story by the news and observer.  Charlotte is and will always be better.
‚ÄúLooks down to Charlotte and sees banking, over at Chapel Hill and Durham and sees higher education, and the fact that we have more PhDs per capita and thinks, yep, we will be ok.‚Äù  Here‚Äôs the problem though, we also have extremely high unemployment and a DES that just doesn‚Äôt seem to work.  Not all of us will come out ok soon.  Hopefully we can stabilize the million+ that are un or under-employed very quickly.
Here are all 10 cities not ranked in any order ,  Boise City, Idaho  Denver, Colorado  Durham, North Carolina  Madison, Wisconsin  Provo, Utah  Raleigh, North Carolina  Salt Lake City, Utah  San Jose, California  Tucson, Arizona  Washington, D.C.
At least they got a racetrack worth a damn
You will forgive me, but the under/unemployed were there long before this event happened. The sudden concern for them is very funny. Plus, there are those who are destitute and homeless. They are also part and parcel to the state. They are in dire straits. Hopefully we can do something to help ALL Tarheels, not just those who are 'exploitable'... oh, sorry I mean 'employable'... or are the aforementioned just 'expendable'? The very government seems to think they are. The recent voting record of the state seems to say they are. It is a shame that there are human beings that are just 'background noise' in a state that boasts all of the things you mention.
Also, here's a Forbes link: https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurabegleybloom/2020/05/12/ranked-us-cities-coronavirus-recovery/#755e9071de92
Forgot about this post until now.  Shameful only 17 folks from the raleigh/Durham were able to down vote my comment.  Long live CLT!!

Blue Cross/Blue Shield North Carolina - Political Influence (COVID-19 April 2020)
We‚Äôre getting to the end of May 2020. I want to bring up a report Mandy Cohen, MD promoted on April 6.Blue Cross/Blue Shield North Carolina is a $10 billion healthcare insurance company with an enormous amount of state power and very few barriers to push their political influence on everyone. I think they are corrupt since they have a monopoly on this healthcare market (and we deserve better).But, I am impressed by their political influence to produce blatantly false reports and get it read on local news. The organization also has no shame in saying we ‚Äì at BC/BS NC - staffed it with some of the most conflicted ‚Äúbusiness side of the house‚Äù people in our organization (it‚Äôs in plain English: the actuary, the medical expense strategy ‚Äì they didn‚Äôt even ‚Äúcloak‚Äù it by offering a doctor! OMG!)Let‚Äôs go back to April 6: BC/BS NC‚Äôs report (staffed by their employees) states 250,000 ‚Äì 750,000 COVID-infected North Carolinians (2.4% - 7.1% of the State Population) ‚Äúby the end of our forecast period, June 1 2020.‚Äù The epidemiologists (‚Äúpaid hires‚Äù for BC/BS NC) emphasized the point ‚Äúthese estimates include unconfirmed infections. Thus, the additional stress imposed on the health care system is a direct result of having roughly three times as many infected North Carolinians (750,000 vs. 250,000) over the same time period.‚Äù We are here on May 15: today‚Äôs actual data is 16,500 COVID-infected North Carolinians.I‚Äôm saying it to North Carolinians again: this healthcare company uses scare tactics to get their way. I'm going to name-names because the report name-names.Bradley Adams, MS. Managing Actuary (Blue Cross/Blue Shield ‚Äì Business Staff)Scott Heiser, MPH.

I don't really see the connection to BCBS. Can you elaborate more? What is the motivation to publish a bad model?  However, models are sometimes wrong. This is how science works.
I'm not trying to stick up for BC/BS, but it may be because of a report such as this one that the cases are so low in NC.  Sorry I stumbled upon this after looking at numbers by state. Considering the infection rate elsewhere, I would say that their estimate of cases weren't far off.  This is considering that confirmed cases per 1 million population are around 4-10k in many states (and 16k, 18k in NJ and NY).  Since the population of NC is 10.5 million you would think there would be 50k - 100k confirmed cases and then many more asymptomatic and unconfirmed ones.  So would you rather the response been weaker and the cases have been much much higher?
I think your critical thinking/reading skills are lacking, while your conspiracy theory skills are on overdrive.  You made me go back to this old article The report you didn't link to    [https://www.newsobserver.com/news/coronavirus/article241797076.html](https://www.newsobserver.com/news/coronavirus/article241797076.html)  clearly states that the numbers that are part of this conspiracy may come to pass in models where all social distancing restrictions are **fully lifted at the end of April with numbers reported for the end of June.  So A. we didn't fully lift restrictions, and B, it isn't June.**   For Maintain projections it clearly states their numbers include unconfirmed infections, which you have no data to refute, but with a positive test rate as high as we have, and continued lack of testing, 250k as an upper bound seems sound.   None of this is a conspiracy, it's a model that modeled conditions that didn't happen, models will then get updated with new information, simulating other conditions, with notes on their modeling assumptions and methods, to be compared against other models. That isn't a conspiracy.
> The coronavirus could infect as many as 750,000 people in North Carolina **by the end of May if social distancing policies are not extended past April**  1. It's not the end of May yet.  2. The social distancing policies were extended past April.  Why are you claiming this is a valid comparison?
This is less about anything else but preparing for the worst and hoping for the best.  Cooper has taken extra precautions that have kept our infection rates down, and thus we don't meet the situation of that initial model. Rather than pointing fingers, I'm instead very grateful that we are weathering this storm better than predicted.
Here's the link for a refresh: https://www.newsobserver.com/news/coronavirus/article241797076.html
You are suggesting North Carolinians don't trust our elected governor to make good decisions without scare tactics.   I disagree.
The Reddit community leaders have rules about links to news articles. I have to follow them or my posts get deleted. I did proactively add the link to the article in the comments.  The report is in plain English (page 4): "by the end of our forecast period, June 1, 2020."  Do you know the definition of unconfirmed COVID infection? A person tests positive and their test sample isn't sent to a separate lab for confirmatory testing.  Where were you on April 6?
I have different questions:   Why were Blue Cross/Blue Shield Staff "in the Business Unit" authors on this paper? Why isn't there a single Blue Cross/Blue Shield Physician an author on this paper? What credentials do the two people below bring to the table?  Bradley Adams, MS.   Managing Actuary (Blue Cross/Blue Shield ‚Äì Business Staff)  Scott Heiser, MPH.   Senior Manager, Healthcare and Medical Expense Strategy (Blue Cross/Blue Shield ‚Äì Business Staff)   In academia, both gentlemen have a financial conflict of interest and a vested interest in the outcome.  As I said - I'm impressed BC/BS NC is "so open" with corruption they let their "medical expense strategy" staff and their "actuary" staff put their names on documents.  How far off the mark was the result? Way off!
Preach! You are the only one who gets it.
I agree this was about leadership. He knows how to steady a ship in troubled waters.
I don't think that's exactly true, looking at the study.
I‚Äôm not sure what you are suggesting. I think you are suggesting that NC (or any state) does not need to take precautions because the numbers aren‚Äôt as bad as they were estimating (even though these estimates were considering a lack of precautions). If that is you argument, I‚Äôd say you are sorely mistaken.   All you‚Äôd need to do is look at states that were hit much harder than NC, such as NY, and know this wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúscare tactics‚Äù.
"Unconfirmed" can also mean symptomatic but had no testing done. Typically a positive test without confirmatory testing is called a presumptive positive, not unconfirmed.
Because a large part of the model was forecasting infection as it relates to hospital capacity and the likelihood of overwhelming ICUs? They also likely have national data from claims and other states like NY, length of stays, rates of incubation and hospitalization to feed the model.  A  Managing Actuary's job is literally to measure and assess risk, one right now likely finds themselves forecasting business readiness in the event of widespread shortages or sickness, risk of complete wing or hospital shut down due to outbreak, PPE and other resource shortages. Similarly I have no idea why you think someone with a  masters in *Medical* Sciences, a Master of *Public Health*,  or a *Master of Science in Public Health*  could not contribute.  In short, this wasn't a medical paper, it was always a measure of modeling risk against hopital capacity AKA "business". I don't love our for profit system either, but to pretend like anyone who doesn't have a PHD and a white lab coat can't analyze data or work on models such as these is silly.  Finally... it's a pretty shoddy conspiracy if your investigation involved scrolling to ***Page 6*** and freaking out when you read the words they printed in bold.
Conspiratorial dot-hunting aside, you're pointing out that a model predicated on X happening and projected to a date in the future doesn't match a reality where X didn't happen and it's currently the present.  Why is it you think these things are directly comparable?
You're right (sorry about that). If I read the paper correctly, The model has a confirm and unconfirmed category in order to work.
This is spilled milk I'm discussing. I'm documenting it as I see it.  On April 6: The White House released a report. North Carolina (using Blue Cross/Blue Shield ‚Äì NC Report) released a report.  [https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronaNC/comments/g597xo/remember\_april\_6th\_two\_reports\_released\_one\_press/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronaNC/comments/g597xo/remember_april_6th_two_reports_released_one_press/)  I don‚Äôt have to write you a thesis on what happened. Mandy told North Carolinians (in plain English) 250K to 750K people will likely be COVID-infected by June 1st 2020 according to the forecast. Do you think the common person understands probability? She didn't give a 101 Statistics course during the Press Conference.  You are "backfilling" this credibility argument saying this authorship (sponsored by one organization) have access to deidentified claims data.  Well, nobody is reading ‚Äúan update‚Äù of this BC/BS-NC ‚Äúbusiness plan‚Äù because it was flawed at the start. I can‚Äôt find it on their organization's webpage.  [https://mediacenter.bcbsnc.com/](https://mediacenter.bcbsnc.com/)  [https://mediacenter.bcbsnc.com/news/news-stories](https://mediacenter.bcbsnc.com/news/news-stories)  When a company that wrote the paper doesn‚Äôt back-up their report, that‚Äôs a problem (it‚Äôs not even posted).  [https://www.novisci.com/](https://www.novisci.com/)  ‚ÄúOur mission is to improve outcomes for vulnerable patients with complex health conditions through principled data science.‚Äù  I'll agree that we agree to disagree. Your assumptions are just assumptions. We don't know their methodology.  It's scary when THE EXPERT says - at the press conference - the work we produced is no better than "weather forecast like information." My weatherman doesn't forecast more than 7-14 days! Their report: ALMOST TWO MONTHS? OMG!  I'll also agree with you: It's not peer-reviewed and published in a reputable journal. Because, that is how real research is accomplished and they didn't want the scrutiny.
My goal is to document the outcome of this report. I think that's fair.  May 17 2020:   18,130 cases and 676 deaths  Their report:     250K - 750K North Carolinian COVID-infections by June 1 2020 according to their forecast.
You haven't even come *close* to answering my question.
I really don't want to get into the politics (but that's what you want).  From the White House:  The IHME Model released [a POSITIVE report on North Carolina's progress on April 6th](https://indyweek.com/news/northcarolina/IHME-model-north-carolina-death-projection/) .  ‚ÄúOn March 30 the IHME model‚Äîwhich was used to create the White House coronavirus task force projections of 100,000‚Äì240,000 deaths in the U.S.‚Äîforecast 2,411 deaths in North Carolina before August 4, with the peak coming on April 22. On that day, it predicted, the state‚Äôs hospitals would be short 686 hospital beds, 606 ICU beds, and 633 ventilators.  On April 6, the model moves our peak up to April 15, but in every other way, it is unambiguously positive: The projected death toll is revised downward to 496 (technically, a range of 315‚Äì757), while we‚Äôre now projected to have far more ICU beds and hospital beds than we need. We are still 219 ventilators shy of the demand.  Importantly, the virus appears to peter out in North Carolina around early May. However, the IHME model assumes that strict social-distancing measures will remain in place nationwide until June. Returning to business as usual earlier than that may lead to another spike in cases.‚Äù  From North Carolina's Leadership (and this is the ONLY thing that was broadcast on April 6):  [https://www.newsobserver.com/news/coronavirus/article241797076.html](https://www.newsobserver.com/news/coronavirus/article241797076.html)  The experts who wrote the North Carolina paper "got it wrong." We are no where near the 250K - 750K COVID-infections. That is all I wrote about...  \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*  I think you're "out there" to say this Blue Cross Blue Shield NC paper is the only game in town. The White House had press briefings daily through-out March and into April about their reports. They had better intelligence about the models and continuously revised their reports to report progress.  The President continuously got in the way (an insurmountable hurdle).  Just saying ....
It's like you're having a conversation with yourself. Have you even *read* any of my comments. *Nothing* you said is relevant to anything I asked.

TOP 10 U.S. STATES BY CORONAVIRUS CASES (March 15 - April 30)


A coronavirus hero

This implies that he ever cared about the uninsured...
Anyone who takes as much money as Thom Tillis has taken from the NRA is a crook.
Perhaps the best use of this meme I've ever seen.
cal cunningham, babeyyyy
I read this as Thom dumped his stock right before COVID19 became so significant and did he then go buy stock in the company that makes this new promising drug?
If you are expecting Tillis to be concerned about his constituents, you have been misled to believe he gives a shit about any of us.
Wasn't Obamacare supposed to fix this?
This doesn't make any sense at all. Why would pharma company's not want the gov to pay for its products from tax money?       I mean, I know Reddit's gonna bias, but at least don't make it this dumb.
Democrats are very obvious in their tactics too. A single evening watching the news with a critical mind would show that. My only ask of you would be to find someone in your peer group who votes differently from you, let them make their case and genuinely listen.
This sub is beginning to stink. Still can‚Äôt believe the celebration over the protestor lady who contracted the virus.
Where‚Äôs Obamacare in this meme?
He‚Äôs definitely fucking them
Which is hilarious given he's trying to slip anti-2a stuff into coronavirus relief bills. He's awful. He's not pro anything, except Thom Tillis, of course.
As a pro 2A, fuuuuuuuuuck the NRA.
No. Just without any real underlying principles or convictions. Whatever gets him elected is ‚Äúright.‚Äù
Lol why the nra specially?
Thank you! It's OC.
I'm looking forward to November
To an extent. Had the entire package and program of what the ACA was meant to be been implemented.  The exchanges were neutered. Several states didn't expand Medicare to handle the lowest incomes. The requirements to have insurance or pay into the penalty pool were eliminated (effectively, yes, they still exist, but the penalty is $0).
The government caps the price they will pay on a service. So everyone will pay the same no matter what. Which, reduces the potential profits.    Think of it the same way a car dealership does business.  Lets say the cost of the car is $100. The dealership  will put the sticker price at $200.  Now some savy people negotiate and get it for 150. But many will still buy it for 200.  Now it so happens they need to move quantity and put it on sale for 150 and someone negotiates to 125. Still profit  but not as much right.   But if the government steps in and says we will pay you 120 flat for the cars and not a penny more, they either acceot the offer or loose huge sales.  there is a lot of  potential profit lost. And its all about maxium profit. Much cheaper to pay off the people passing laws. 300k is nothing to the company, but to an individual its a huge boost to their pockets so why not?  There are only 2 things most politicians care about, money and power. Many dont give 2 shits about the people they represent. Until its time for you to cast your vote.
I'm not a Democrat and I think Thom Tillis is shady and only cares about pandering and reelection.
The GOP has trump. Please explain why I should ever vote for a party that supports such a travesty. When you watch the news do you see how America is failing compared to the rest of the world?  Stop being stupid.
A single evening watching the news shows that republicans recommend injecting bleach and buttchugging lightbulbs to cure oneself of COVID19.
Fair, but is now a time to show the mutual evils of the party, or to call out individuals separate of party.
I have let them make their case, many, many times. They always come up with the same bullshit platitudes as "dude, just watch the news". Your reasoning is not nearly as solid as you think.
I don't celebrate anyone getting sick, but she said she was infected and asymptomatic. She is exactly who would pass the virus on to others if we were to return to normal. Some people who get it aren't asymptomatic, they get sick and then they die. I'm not glad she's infected, but she and the others protesting are fucking idiots who want to endanger everyone because they don't believe in science.
Bye, Felicia
Talk shit, get ~~hit~~ corona.
Hopefully the rest of the protesters contract the virus also.
You play with matches, you get burned.
You know, I almost read the comments on that one but I had a feeling it was going to be a bunch of hateful people being vindictive. I was really hoping I was just being negative- what a shame.
Don't know, but in real life it's got me opting not to take some self-employed tax deductions and paying more because then I would make too little for ACA insurance. The NCGOP decided not to expand Medicaid so I would have nothing. How can you defend people who so blatantly walk all over the little guy?
Dead in a ditch thanks to the GOP.
Stop trying to push GOP talking points. You‚Äôre making a fool of yourself.
Still negotiating with a hostile actor while it's guts are spilling in the floor
Wrong meme to preach
Underrated comment
The Republicans aren't pro 2A on a federal level or they'd have easily passed the hearing protection act or literally anything else when they had both houses.  Instead bumpstocks got banned via EO. On the same vein Dems would've passed weapons restrictions under Obama with both houses, but he actually extended carry rights to include national parks. It's all lip service on guns from both sides.
Same here brother.
Because they‚Äôre a lobbying group funded by gun manufacturers. Their primary goal isn‚Äôt to protect our Second Amendment rights or to have sensible conversations about the best way to balance public safety with the right to bear arms in the 21st century or any of that: it‚Äôs to sell more guns.   I‚Äôm pro-gun, but I‚Äôve got some positions that conflict with the NRA and while I‚Äôm willing to honestly debate my views with people, the NRA deliberately poisons the well because they have every incentive in the world to scare people into a frenzy and dump endless buckets of time, money, and resources into lying to people because that‚Äôs what sells more guns  Hell, even if I agreed with them on everything on a policy level, I‚Äôd want to come to those position through, to borrow a term, ‚Äúfacts and logic.‚Äù The fact that they have a financial incentive to not change their positions and to sell as many guns as possible regardless of what would be best for the well-being of the average American who doesn‚Äôt own millions of dollars in Smith & Wesson stock would disgust me and I‚Äôd be compelled to not support them just on principle  Sorry if this is more than you wanted but **fuck the NRA**
WTH does that even mean? The 300gs reference here was money that went straight to Tommy boys' campaign.   Or am I missing something here!?
This right here is the correct answer.  So much of the ACA / ObamaCARE they never even implemented.   One was going to be people could be on the exchange no matter where they worked.  They never gave people with work insurance a competitive alternative. My neighbor has a 6k deductible and then it only pays 80/20.    If my neighbor could should that was suppose to drive down cost.   they should have had a public option also.
Everyone needs to remember a very simple thing: Insurance companies, banks, and billionaires don‚Äôt want some of the money. They want all of the money. When one of them complains about a deal where they would make more money than you could ever dream of, it is because they were planning on making much much more.
The big insurance and PBMs get more rebate and exert influence to get reduced prices. Though a single payer will have far more leverage much like in China, some EU countries etc.
Still a broken analogy. $120/car is still better than not selling, which is what people without means to healthcare buy. $0.
My grandmother is hyper conservative but when asked about Thom tillis she says "*Well, I dont know how I feel about him. Hes done some things*". Wont elaborate on those things just that she disapproves of them in that kind of old lady way which basically means "*I fucking hate that guy but im a trillion years old and I gotta be polite about it.*"
I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre taking time to understand why these protesters feel the way they do. Not being able to work and provide for your family has significant physical and mental consequences. Don‚Äôt make huge assumptions about people‚Äôs intentions or intelligence. And by all means, don‚Äôt celebrate someone getting ill, I don‚Äôt care how much of an ass they may be.
Whatever you say Donnie
Edgy
If you don‚Äôt use it, you lose it
How would you defend Roy Cooper keeping large corporations essential and continuously deeming the little guy non essential? I could present many examples here. Democrats take corporate donations too. Let‚Äôs consider both parties and their actions here.
Explain
Took the words right out of my mouth.
You mean the insurance companies, banks, and billionaires who own businesses that employ people and provide them with health insurance? Or like.. the evil ones from the movies?
There are roughly 243 million with insurance in the US vs. 30 million without.   So for simplicity lets assume everyine needs a car, but  no one without insurance buys. If we say the average is 175 per person based on the savy negotiator thats 42,525,000,000 in sales. Now if we add in the 30 million uninsured and drop the number to 120 that comes to 32,760,000,000. Thats a difference of 9,760,000,000 less profits just in overall sales. Not to mention the additional overhead expenses based on production of 30,000,000 more cars.   So im not really sure that the analogy is broken. Over simplified, yes. But it goes to prove the point.
Then they should not be out celebrating the 60,000+ Americans that are dead in less than 2 months from a virus.   Because thats what they are doing. The folks protesting today with guns literally said it was a big 'party'.   That should feel like a slap in the face to every single actual American including you.
I understand that it's stressful, I haven't worked in a month and I'm really worried too, but calling the lockdowns government overreach seems like sticking your head in the sand. There are legitimate reasons to change our behavior, simply demanding things go back to normal because you want them to is childish at best. Staying home would be a lot less scary for families if the GOP didn't constantly attack social safety nets like unemployment and food stamps. For the record, I said twice that I am not glad she is infected. The irony of an aysymptomatic carrier demanding she be able to go around like normal is just ridiculous. She's basically another Typhoid Mary and she deserves to be called out for it.
Their anger is misdirected and causing further harm, including more deaths and more economic damage.   If you want the truth, most of us are \*enraged\* that there is a movement that wants to kill millions of people because they cannot adjust to suddenly being poor. I'm also enraged at a system that has utterly failed the American people because the safety net has been steadily eroded by that same side of the political aisle.   Given they're coming from a flat-earth level of understanding Epidemiology, it's tragic in a way that these protests will continue to spread the virus among themselves and kill some of them and their loved ones. It's tragic they will infect others who were doing the right things. It's tragic that our education system has fallen so far behind that this is the kind of shit people do when asked to do their part in a global pandemic.   But is it darkly humorous when it inevitably happens? Fuck yes it is.
Seriously though, you're so triggered by a simple meme that you've felt compelled to make multiple whataboutism comments throughout this thread, you have so many parent comments you might as well start receiving child support from Reddit.
Fuck off you fucking ghoul. If someone is being reckless and saying people should be out then they absolutely get what is coming to them.
The Democrats are far from what I could wish, but the Republicans are just so damn obvious in their tactics. Stir up votes using fear (of foreigners, abortions, anarchists, what have you) and then use their positions to deregulate markets, wreck the environment, and further widen the income gap. I don't vote for Democrats, I vote against Republicans.
I don‚Äôt mean to stir here, but can you provide those specific examples? I‚Äôm genuinely curious.

No one is criticizing anyone for employing anyone. I can criticize some of their actions without criticizing every action.   This isn‚Äôt complicated.
The ones that got rid of pensions, fight against health care, fight wage increases, basically killed unions, promote predatory lending/credit, and bought politicians... It's not every corporation nor every billionaire, but it's enough to tip the scale so far that getting it back close to level might be impossible.  I've worked for sole proprietorships/small businesses, global conglomerates, and mid-sized corporations, and from my experience, these practices appear to be standard operating procedures by those at the very top.
Seriously, you fall for this propaganda.  While Jeff Bezo made another 20 Billion his workers continue to make less than $20 an hour on avg.   Jeff B could give all of them 50 shares of stock as a 1 time bonus and still have billions.
The contrast setting IRL doesn't go as high as your TV.
Medicaid/medicare take over the entire national healthcare is not the vote or bill. Re-run the numbers where everybody else stays on their normal insurance, and the uninsured are picked up by medicaid/medicare, and let me know what you find.
Your Reddit comments are reckless
yet you‚Äôll lose your mind when ppl protesting in favor of a guy who pointed a gun at cops get arrested
I voted R my entire life until '08.   I got so sick of the lies about the Tax Cuts trickling down, and caring about the budget.    The budget has been the R's battle cry since they cut taxes big in 82 and created it.     Clinton got it under control by raising taxes .04 on the dollar for the top rate, and R's lost their mind.   But in 8 years we had a surplus.  In come Bush and another Tax Cut and another hole in the deficit.  And Wow.... Can you image how a R's would be going crazy if President Clinton lock down the country or rang up all this debt.
I can buy a dress from WMT. I can buy a gaming console at TGT. What completely unnecessary item could I not buy from AMZN? I would assume BBY could repair my electronic devices. I literally could not pay a mom and pop shop to provide these items or services for  me, they likely did NOT get their due PPP relief from the federal government, and If they did provide me these services, they risk getting fined by the police.  It is unfair and I realize these are very complicated circumstances. But can we not try and understand why certain people are protesting?
You would never acknowledge how much it was collapsing in terms of costs and options before the 2016 election. So yeah, why bother continue this particular thread?
Could you give me examples of major employers that do live up to your moral standards?
The guy is right. If you are going to protest against a fucking virus and think you are so special you won't get it, you are a fucking idiot.
Well, I haven‚Äôt told anyone to go out in a global pandemic so - no, not really.
The fuck are you going on about?
>But in 8 years we had a surplus.  You do realize that congress sets and approves the budget, not the president right? The results during the Clinton administration were the fruits of Clinton crossing the aisle and working with guys like Trett Lott, Bob Dole, and Newt Gingrich. Much like the relationship between Tip O'Neill and Reagan.  The problem we've seen over the last decade plus is the absolute refusal of opposition leaders to even attempt to work togethr on anything. From Obama's infamous "Elections have consequences" statement to the recent impeachment...opposition party leaders are at each others throats more then ever. Any compromise becomes weakness and is protratyed as such in a divided media and will dog out leaders that don't tow the lines of their own biases. This puts them on blast throughout all of their own little media bubbles, and does not bode well for society in general.
Hmm, Walmart permanently laid off 300 people in NC, how is Cooper helping them? Best Buy furloughed even more. How is Cooper helping big business?  Oh by allowing the head shops stay open that mostly did? Because they threw out a bag of chips and said they were a grocery store?   People should be protesting for you know, the UE benefits they are entitled to, that more small businesses are helped, but no, they are protesting, so they can go back and earn Walmart more money while brandishing guns that cost more than most minimum wage people bring home in months.   Tell me again how your argument even makes any sense.
Not even a single link? Low effort.  Also, I'd prefer Medicare For All. Obamacare is a GOP doctrine. However, it did help a great number of people by expanding coverage and managing pre-existing conditions better.
Something something Medicare expansion
It seems you are more bothered by the comments wanting better conditions than you are mad at the situation itself. That seems ridiculous.
These aren't tied to my moral standards. These are tied to basic human standards.  But the question is: Why can't I name any that meet this criteria? They should be the rule and not the exception.
Go to opensecrets.org if you want to see who is bought and paid for as well as to see who is paying them. Its all rather simple at this point to see behind the curtain.
> Could you give me examples of major employers that do live up to your moral standards?  Costco?
I was leaning towards the ‚Äúfuck you‚Äù to an absolute stranger. A lot of people need their jobs back, rehire their employees, or simply just to lay out on a beach. I personally believe there‚Äôs a practical and safe way to do that. But yeah, I must be an awful person for disagreeing with you, whoever the fuck you are
What happened during Obama's last 4 years:  congressional deadlock.  Clinton was able to work across the aisle because they worked with him.  Democratic infighting should demonstrate that Democrats are policy focused and not blindly following their team
You are right on the specifics, but not for the bill I am talking about.  Yes, the House and the Senate write the bills, but in this case the 103rd congress when this tax reform was passed, both houses of Congress was in Democratic control.  And not a single Republican in either house voted for it, see below.  "Ultimately every Republican in Congress voted against the bill, as did a number of Democrats. Vice President Al Gore broke a tie in the Senate on both the Senate bill and the conference report. The House bill passed 219-213 on Thursday, May 27, 1993.[1] The House passed the conference report on Thursday, August 5, 1993, by a vote of 218 to 216 (217 Democrats and 1 independent (Bernie Sanders (I-VT)) voting in favor; 41 Democrats and 175 Republicans voting against).[2] The Senate passed the conference report on the last day before their month's vacation, on Friday, August 6, 1993, by a vote of 51 to 50 (50 Democrats plus Vice President Gore voting in favor, 6 Democrats (Frank Lautenberg (D-NJ), Richard Bryan (D-NV), Sam Nunn (D-GA), Bennett Johnston Jr. (D-LA), David L. Boren (D-OK), and Richard Shelby (D-AL) now (R-AL)) and 44 Republicans voting against). President Clinton signed the bill on August 10, 1993. "   Also, the 2nd Half of the 20th Century the President has alot more control over the party and the agenda.   The crazy 21% tax rate for corporations was President Trumps Idea, the GOP was happy with 28%.   And if you listen to the podcast WICKED GAMES, you will hear that the D/R have been fighting over the same themes since Washington.    It is shocking and disappointing how the same themes seem to shape the countries politics.
I personally advocate for covering preexisting conditions. However, Obamacare premiums increased dramatically and the number of coverage options readily shrank. That is common knowledge. I do not believe that a Medicare for All approach would be any different compared to the Obamacare experience.

Yep. All one needs is to be aware of what's happening around you even if it isn't happening to you (yet).
Every company I‚Äôve ever worked for has given me wonderful standards in terms of pay and health coverage. But, I work in the United States. Where are you where you can‚Äôt get good to wages and healthcare?

You realize that if we open things tomorrow, most of those people won't get their jobs back, are not going to rehire, and are going to be afraid of going to the beach?   Just because the switch is flipped doesn't mean the damage is done and that the virus is gone.   Remember how 2008 changed things? Maybe you are too young to remember, but this is our 2008, but 100x worse.   Buckle in. If you arent essential right now, you won't be in the next year either.   Better start protesting for actual UE benefits, because come the end of the summer, you will be getting nothing from the feds either.
It's covered above, but you obviously didn't bother to read it.
So when/if Obamacare is pulled and there is no option and private insurance companies refuse to cover prexisting conditions just like they did before Obamacare, are you going to march in the streets against the GOP?  Nah, you will just tell us that the market will fix it.   Boy at least most the conservative trolls that post on this subreddit are actually fairly intelligent people to begin with.
> However, Obamacare premiums increased dramatically and the number of coverage options readily shrank.  ....as a result of the half-measures implemented due to the crippling done by the Republicans? Once again, see the articles linked.
Lol premiums always increase rapidly. That is common knowledge.
I've lived in NC for my whole life!  Almost no workers get proper wages. Wage growth, when it has occurred,  hasn't kept pace with the rising cost of living.   For healthcare, I've had a few years of pretty great coverage, but the rest of the time the coverage has been pretty terrible. I am a healthy male, though, so I've been lucky although the one time I was put on some medication my insurer immediately told me it wasn't covered. But health insurance shouldn't have anything to do with my employer.     I'm also able to understand that my own personal situation is irrelevant if most people are hurting. Most people are hurting. Stand with them.
Fucking any job that pays below $15 an hour. Congrats on having a privileged life, that's not the case for many though.
No thanks. Let‚Äôs revisit this comment this time next year.
I don‚Äôt know but I‚Äôm hopeful and I believe in our country‚Äôs ingenuity.

Lockdown protest leader who tested positive for coronavirus vows to attend upcoming rallies

Dumbass
They have a word for folks like that: statistic
Can't we arrest her for making terrorist threats?  Ain't that what they're doing to covid19'ers anyways? https://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/491798-texas-teen-who-threatened-to-spread-coronavirus-faces-terrorism
This is about the fourth time I've seen a news outlet publish an article based on that faulty Raleigh News & Observer report that was based on a phone interview where Whitlock answered "no comment" to all the questions because that protest group has a media person to handle press questions. Since they couldn't get an answer out of Whitlock they instead decided to write their story based on a Facebook post Whitlock wrote instead of contacting the media contact for the group.  Whitlock had 2 lab tests done because the first one was damaged in transit to the lab. After the second one she was told to self-quarantine in her house for 2 weeks by her doctor, which she says she did. She missed 2 protests while quarantined and reportedly didn't attend a third one scheduled a couple of days after her quarantine ended.
Hate it here
I ‚Äúvow‚Äù to not give a shit.
Nasty woman. Lock her up!
Tell ultra Karen to check herself.
I wouldn't take too much stock from a tabloid paper from the United Kingdom seriously.
*The Independent* is a well respected news outlet. While it was printed in tabloid format for a while, before it went online-only, there is a history of hard-news newspapers in the UK transitioning from broadsheet to tabloid formats, distinct from the type of newspaper that the term "tabloid journalism" derives from. For example, *The Times* is arguably the UK newspaper of record, but it is printed in tabloid format.

Coronavirus: COVID-19 cases by zip code is new NCDHHS feature

Here's the [actual NCDHHS site](https://www.ncdhhs.gov/divisions/public-health/covid19/covid-19-nc-case-count#zip-code-map).
If I could make one recommendation, at this point in the pandemic, I think the majority of "total cases" are now recovered.  So, knowing the total cases for a zip code is not very productive.  Maybe a 14 day rolling count of new cases so we can visualize where the outbreak is still happening.
That UI gave me cancer
ALL of these numbers are totally useless without widespread testing available.  WHERE is my test?
I am not doing a great job of explaining the point. Dr Birx does a much better job.  https://www.bing.com/videos/search?view=detail&mid=E4F2624ED162F9745126E4F2624ED162F9745126&shtp=GetUrl&shid=57fc9da7-0a3e-4e37-9775-f4e81ab176ee&shtk=RHIgQmlyeCAtIEhBTEYgb2YgQ292aWQgdGVzdHMgdGhhdCB0ZXN0IHBvc2l0aXZlLi4uYXJlIGZhbHNlLXBvc2l0aXZlcw%3D%3D&shdk=RHIgQmlyeCAtIEhBTEYgKG9yIG1vcmUhKSBvZiBDb3ZpZCB0ZXN0cyB0aGF0IHRlc3QgcG9zaXRpdmUgYXJlIGxpa2VseSB0byBiZSBmYWxzZS1wb3NpdGl2ZXMuIGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlvdXR1YmUuY29tL3dhdGNoP3Y9R2ROLS0xMWJ0YzAgQXByaWwgMjA6IFVTIEFEVklTT1IgRHIgRGVib3JhaCBCaXJ4IHN0YXRlZCB5b3UgY2FuIG5vdCBhc3N1bWUgdGhlIENvdmlkIHRlc3QgcG9zaXRpdmUgcmVzdWx0IGlzIGNvcnJlY3QgLSBpdCBpcyBsaWtlbHkgdG8gYmUgd3JvbmcgbW9zdCBvZiB0aGUgdGltZSAtIGEgImZhbHNlIHBvc2l0aXZlIi4gU2hlIHNheXM6ICJJZiB5b3UgaGF2ZSAxJSBvZiB0aGUgLi4u&shhk=WE4Nzvy8HrqrYJh1KjvoQSiaZyYQJt%2FonxhHTSM7NdU%3D&form=VDSHOT&shth=OSH.VMt3Ui8hxFeVJWjjf6RyBA
A shame that the county-by county one doesn't actually work beyond the different shades of blue. I think Facebook has a functional one.
Using zip codes to map geospatial data is [not a good practice] (https://carto.com/blog/zip-codes-spatial-analysis/)
SC had this almost a month ago.
when you type in a zip in the search on the map, it just takes you to that zip. it doesnt give you numbers.
Agreed - really frustrating to see the headlines of "NC Tops 14k cases" or whatever we're at, with less focus on how many ACTIVE cases there are. That's the whole idea, flattening the curve so there aren't an overwhelming amount of CONCURRENT cases...so why not focus on that?
This might be true in rural areas but I think the urban areas aren‚Äôt in as good of shape
>  at this point in the pandemic  What point do you think we are at?  According to the available data, including infected, recovered, tested (https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6), we are still at the beginning.
Only 200,000 cases out of the 1.2 million have had an outcome. So the majority of people have not recovered.  Most of the non gov sites are going to show you a 7 day rolling avg of cases and the other numbers.  # of tests on avg and the % positive of those tests, along with hospitalization numbers are what I‚Äôm looking at.  I would imagine this data is more for media and organizations to track and process to do all the stuff the government won‚Äôt or can‚Äôt do, but that‚Äôs a whole different political issue.
Total case count is still a productive number.  At this rate, flattening the curve is still the most important to reduce the amount of deaths, but there is no guaranteed vaccine.  We‚Äôre still looking at a long term herd immunity solution.  Total cases/total population should correspond to an eventual slowing down of the rate of infection.
I think it was made by the same people that did the Unemployment website. Lol
at least it didn't give you the 'rona.
4 months into "shit hit the fan" with this and people in general still can't get tests.  Remember when we were supposed to have drive through testing at Walmarts, CVS, and other areas? That evaporated and was swept under the rug like it was never mentioned. Months later you can count on 1 hand the number of drive through testing sites in this state.
Testing asymptotic persons is not advised unless they are at high risk or in contact with those at high risk. Testing asymptotic people would lead to a very high number of false positives.
It works. Just click on show a larger map. Then every time you touch the counties you can see the cases and deaths.
Your point?
It isn't a great UI.  You need to click on the blue flag icon, then the  little arrow on right.  Or, click on the area next to the flag and it should highlight that specific zipcode. This is probably the easier of the two ways.
I'm seeing case and death stats when I hover over the different ZIPcodes.  I've got Chrome, if that helps.
But then you can click on the county and it will give them to you.
The number of active cases and total cases simply isn't that different this early in the pandemic.
Because it doesn't fit the narrative of terrifying everyone into submission.
Several weeks since the beginning of the outbreak and a relatively slow doubling rate in NC for the past several weeks?  It was just an intuitive assumption but I think my point stands on it's own. Cases reported in March are not relevant to the current state of new infections.  So continuing to report on total infections doesn't help people understand where we are today.
There may be a flaw in this logic if you are assuming that an increased # of cases corresponds to an increased number of positive people.
Do you know how the asymptotic tests are being distributed? My doctor(Raleigh) has it but my bosses doctor (Cary) doesn‚Äôt have it yet.
From what i have seen a high percentage of people without symptoms are testing positive; people who would be spreading it around it they did not know.   False positives are the result of poor tests
NC needs to get on their game. Can‚Äôt be behind on info like this.
Thanks for the heads up!
Not sure I follow. The primary goal of the lockdowns is so the hospital system is not overwhelmed. So your overall number doesn't matter as much as concurrent cases.  Per CO this morning: "Two-thirds of the people who tested positive have since met CDC guidelines to be released from isolation. That rate is higher than the rate reported on April 27, when county officials said nearly half of people diagnosed with COVID-19 had recovered and been released from isolation."
The percentage of recovered is still quite small.  That data is important because,since we are just at the beginning of this, the change in the total number of cases is important as well as the total number of cases as a percentage of our total population.      Again, it's important to be clear on where we are in this - this is the beginning.  The big question is how close are we to the end of the beginning as we settle in to understand how long the first outbreak is going to last and as we start early planning for the next wave in six months.
Does your use of positive mean currently symptomatic?  If so you are misunderstanding how antibodies/herd immunity work.
I do not know what criteria the are using for prescribing a test.
Even the best test and testing procedure results in a very large number of false positives. Dr Birx explains this well . Posting this again in case you did not happen to see it.  https://www.bing.com/videos/search?view=detail&mid=E4F2624ED162F9745126E4F2624ED162F9745126&shtp=GetUrl&shid=57fc9da7-0a3e-4e37-9775-f4e81ab176ee&shtk=RHIgQmlyeCAtIEhBTEYgb2YgQ292aWQgdGVzdHMgdGhhdCB0ZXN0IHBvc2l0aXZlLi4uYXJlIGZhbHNlLXBvc2l0aXZlcw%3D%3D&shdk=RHIgQmlyeCAtIEhBTEYgKG9yIG1vcmUhKSBvZiBDb3ZpZCB0ZXN0cyB0aGF0IHRlc3QgcG9zaXRpdmUgYXJlIGxpa2VseSB0byBiZSBmYWxzZS1wb3NpdGl2ZXMuIGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlvdXR1YmUuY29tL3dhdGNoP3Y9R2ROLS0xMWJ0YzAgQXByaWwgMjA6IFVTIEFEVklTT1IgRHIgRGVib3JhaCBCaXJ4IHN0YXRlZCB5b3UgY2FuIG5vdCBhc3N1bWUgdGhlIENvdmlkIHRlc3QgcG9zaXRpdmUgcmVzdWx0IGlzIGNvcnJlY3QgLSBpdCBpcyBsaWtlbHkgdG8gYmUgd3JvbmcgbW9zdCBvZiB0aGUgdGltZSAtIGEgImZhbHNlIHBvc2l0aXZlIi4gU2hlIHNheXM6ICJJZiB5b3UgaGF2ZSAxJSBvZiB0aGUgLi4u&shhk=WE4Nzvy8HrqrYJh1KjvoQSiaZyYQJt%2FonxhHTSM7NdU%3D&form=VDSHOT&shth=OSH.VMt3Ui8hxFeVJWjjf6RyBA
>NC needs to get on their game. Can‚Äôt be behind on info like this.  SC just opened the state up and they haven't even hit their peak yet...    Check back in 2 weeks, ok?  Then we'll see who's "behind"......
My point is that testing is increasing, including symptomatic and asymptotic individuals. This greatly increases the counted number of ‚Äúcases‚Äù with no direct correlation to an increase in transmission or increase in actual infected individuals in a population.
Theoretically as more people in the population get it whether symptomatic or asymptomatic, the less people will potentially be able to get it, so it‚Äôll slow down...eventually.    I know we‚Äôre not to the point of testing every person, but it‚Äôs still good to keep track of numbers.  There will be correlations.

North Carolina's Coronavirus Testing Rate Is One Of The Worst In Nation

We have gotten up to about 5,000-6,000/day in the last week.
Ah, but our number of positive tests are also among the lowest . .  . Winning
Hey at least 45th out of 50 is better than our unemployment benefits which are 49th out of 50.  >cries
I really wish people would start to recognize that when it is "bad" the time to be worried is 3 weeks prior.  Half the south is about to start reopening because of bullshit political pressure, and cases are going to explode.
But, hey, let‚Äôs start to reopen ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Novant Health has tests starting tomorrow and is taking appointments now at the Urgent Care centers.
All I‚Äôm saying is we need a huge increase in testing before we can move anywhere past phase one safely. Without the testing, it‚Äôs just guess work, and not educated guess work.
Not that the article is 'wrong' but it seems out of date, but was updated 5 hours ago?   I don't like news stories like this.  Clearly we should increase testing, especially now that we are moving into Phase I re-opening of the state.
It was mentioned in the article that this was an expensive commitment? Does anyone know, ballpark, how much this is costing?  I might be confused but we know there hasn‚Äôt been much in the way of federal guidance and it sounds like when the counties were asked to put to get her a plan there was pushback. Sounds like everything has to be done at the state level. Is anyone else getting that interpretation?  When testing are they talking about testing to see if you actively have the virus or testing for antibodies?
I pleaded with our local testing hospital to allow us to test our plant workers somehow.  They refused unless each person had a prescription from their doctor specifically asking for a test.  We are considered "essential", yet have no means to test our workers.  Currently have around 100 people at the plant.
Hmm, it's as if there should be a federal pandemic response team that can provide support to the states in a time like this.
In fairness, our cases per 100,000 residents is one of the lowest, and we have tons of hospital capacity.  If we treat anyone with the symptoms who can't get a test as a presumed positive... isolate them, give them meds that help, and have hospital beds ready if their conditions worsen... what would we have done differently?  It's just a number, the treatment outcome for the individual is no different for knowing they definitely have it.  I mean clearly, in a perfect world everyone gets a test.  But there's just not enough tests.  We're doing the next best thing.  And our tests per day has risen significantly just in the past few days, so this may be an issue with the data simply not catching up to reality yet.
Plan A: lets put our heads in the sand and hope this goes away. Limit testing so we can massage numbers.  Plan B: Blame someone else
According to this site:  https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us/  it is not the worst.  It's not good, but it's not the worst.
A woman died of Coronavirus in Paris in late 2019 (per. Coronavirus subreddit yesterday) It‚Äôs been here for months. Guarantee over 1,000,000 in NC have been exposed alone.  Testing or not it‚Äôs been here for a long while. Don‚Äôt worry, practice safe social distancing you‚Äôll be fine.
We are doing better than sweden with the same population. And they are all the rage in the news.
Unless you work for Tyson chicken...lmao
Phase 1 folks
I wonder if this record will be broken? Despite the measures taken, the number of cases continues to grow. This is terrifying. To whom it is interesting to know more - I recommend chat –°ovid-19 in the application utopia p2p
Shocking said no one
Lots of offers for antibody tests right now from all the large medical groups in the state.  Those test will determine if you have had it not if you have it.  So please don‚Äôt get the two confused and thinking you are getting tested for a current active case of COVID19.
Yee Yee boys. Gota be first in something üòé.
Gee, thanks, Roy...
So, when it's all about lock downs and who controls what, it's  the governor, but when there's not enough test kits available, it's  the GOP legislature.  Whatever helps you sleep at night...
At that rate it'll only take 4 1/2 years to test the whole state.
Yeah, that‚Äôs a joke.
RE-OPEN NC!  LOWEST POSITIVE TESTS!
Can‚Äôt have positive cases if you don‚Äôt test
Hahaha
For some reason this seems to be our comfort zone. I think NC ranks #3 in terms of military assets but like 48 in terms of military spending. Where are we ranked for education? In the 40‚Äôs somewhere I think. There are more rankings for sure but these just came to mind.
Cold blooded but true.
‚Äú1st in flight, 48th in education.‚Äù
And there will be far more resistance to closing again after we have reopened than there would be to staying closed still.  We might be an intelligent individual species, but en masse we're morons.
When social distancing was imposed six weeks ago, the game plan was to keep it in place until the emergency hospitals set up in dorms and convention centers emptied.  It worked extremely well, so one had to receive treatment in a makeshift hospital.  The game plan was never to prevent people from getting sick.  Most people- more than half of the state, national, and global population, will catch the virus this year.  Dr Cohen, head of the NC Dept. of Health and Human Services, spoke candidly in the press conference when lockdown was imposed "I'm just trying to help people get sick more slowly".  Not to stop them from getting sick, that bridge was burned in early February.  It is not impossible to contain the virus- South Korea has a very firm handle on it, and New Zealand has eliminated it.  But that would have required strong national action in January, things like shutting down most air travel, and starting mass testing months before we actually did.  When that failed, flattening the curve became the only reasonable goal.  We did it.
I wish I could upvote you 30x. We have done nothing to improve availability of testing for the general public in their communities and therefore any decisions we make are based on flawed, extrapolated data. Lots of institutions dropped the ball to get to this point, but I haven't seen anything to lead me to believe we are anywhere near a testing capacity that would make me feel confident.
Clearly we should increase testing *before* moving into re-opening.
Billions will be spent in NC when all is said and done, but a small fraction of that will actually go towards virus testing, tracing and prevention.
Our cases are low because our testing is low lol
ramp up test production at the federal level. provide testing to any American who wants it. The White House has known about this for 5 months.
In comparison to the countries who actually have a handle on this, our current testing capacity is laughable. It should have been ramping up for the past 2 months, but the lack of guidance from the federal level resulted in states fighting each other for supplies and, before you know it, we still have incomparably low penetration for community testing that is accessible to most of the public. Until that happens, and I'm talking orders of magnitude more than our current capacity (even if it's better than it was), this reopening will stick for a month and then shit will hit the fan and we will be staring down shelter in place orders into the fall.
Knowing who has already had the virus is extremely important information.
12th worst is pretty bad.
Only if you're looking for news to confirm that we're not *quite* the worst in the world.  Which, I guess, hooray for us. If you look at places that have actually done well like South Korea or Germany, you would see how badly we're doing.
I'm next door (and it looks like you are, too), and Wilkes's massive jump in cases does *not* make me feel good about Phase 1.  When not quarantining, I work in Forsyth County (and previously in Guilford), and I know that a lot of those Tyson employees travel from as far as east Greensboro, if not further.  They carpool to North Wilkesboro with other employees, and some are refugees who live in close quarters with other refugees.  In other words, lots of close contact for easy transmission-- and not just within the borders of Wilkes.
I reached out to this account and they don't seem to be a bot. They are also not doing any self promotion that I could discern.
Yay! We're first in being ... last?  And don't forget that whole flight thing. Keep sucking it, Ohio.
COVID- 23 is gonna be lit by then
Just wait, they‚Äôre re-opening businesses Monday because the strict orders end Friday. Watch those numbers skyrocket. I‚Äôll make a thread about it if there‚Äôs enough interest but a major automobile factory in Newton is re-opening Monday but trying to keep it secretive.
Can‚Äôt test for positive tests if you don‚Äôt have testing kits :P
I came here to say this.
Depends on what ranking you're looking at, but NC is much closer to middle of the pack for education when combining secondary and universities.   https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/rankings/education
The flight did not last long

Well, if it‚Äôs a consolation prize, survivors might actually be able to get Social Security!
> When that failed, flattening the curve became the only reasonable goal. We did it.  We flattened it (from where it was), but it is not yet flat. And again, per this article, even that data that we're using is incredibly incomplete.
>When that failed, flattening the curve became the only reasonable goal. We did it.  This isn't a "one-and-done" situation, though. We have to keep it flat for as long as possible until we have widespread testing and contact tracing. Reopening now because we flattened the curve is 2020's "Mission Accomplished."
>We did it.  We're *doing* it. We've still got widespread infection in communities across the state. It'll be right back when stay at home is relaxed.
A major point you are glossing over is the complete lack of community testing we currently have. Social distancing and shelter in place were meant to buy time to implement mass public testing and hopefully contact tracing. The federal government did nothing to further that and states have ended up fighting over testing equipment and PPE. If we don't have widely available testing, it doesn't matter if the curve looks ok now, we will reopen partially for a month and then be staring down an extra 3 months of quarantine when it becomes apparent that we weren't prepared to reopen.  Source (because people assume I'm talking out my ass when I say something they don't like): I'm a Master's level biostatistician and I do epidemiology research for a living.
This is the same thing I heard when the shutdown began.  Why our government is not trying to educate us on exactly who is at high risk of suffering serious complications and how to protect yourself as the shutdown is lifted is very confusing to me.
You can't re-open without widespread testing. That's a fact, not political.
That has been done. Nearly all criteria for phase 2 has been met except for the arbitrary 2 week delay.
Will do, thanks for the info.
Which is exactly what we need at the moment. Hopefully ( fingers crossed) there won‚Äôt be rebound from states opening up or a second wave later in the year.
Yes but there's also an *estimated infections* projection based on testing we're NOT doing.  Even that number is low (compared to other states).  My simple comment here is that while North Carolina needs to test more... there's a lack of tests, there's nothing political or nefarious about it.  There's simply no option.  And other states are in worse shape than us, so there's far more money and prioritization being thrown at them.  Let's be thankful that this is a good problem to have... numbers so low we're denied tests because we're not in the weeds like New York.
It is.  I'm not saying it's good, just that it's not the worst.
> Only  I just wanted to put that out there to crub folks trying to tout them as a model for others to follow.
Germany's death per million is about double that of NC
Yup, I'm right next to Wilkes county, up in Ashe. We've only had a handful of confirmed cases here, but of course no one is really getting tested, so honestly who knows.
**FRICK OFF OHIO**
Sorry, but not sorry.  I had it in Feb, before it was trendy or fashionable.  Only found out what it was a couple of weeks ago.  Besides the week I spent on my ass, have been considered essential for 55-60 hours a week.  For me, and the 170+ in the plant where I work, there's been no closure.  No stay at home.  Nothing but a shit ton of OT because of people hoarding.  And my test?  Uh, no...  No test then.  No test after.  And now that I'm seeing a cardiologist about how fucked up I am because of it, the only thing the state of north carolina is doing for me is... letting me keep working.  You blame who you wanna blame and I'll fucking blame who I want to.
If an automotive factory in Newton was closed it was by choice.  Manufacturing plants were excluded from the stay at home orders.
So many businesses never closed. "Essential" businesses may outweigh the non-essential ones. I doubt we'll see skyrocketing numbers because not much is changing.
Businesses acting like people will come out and shop.
Numbers can't skyrocket if test rates don't increase.
That hasn't been the case in GA.
I don‚Äôt think the number I saw  included universities.
For how long? 2 years?  We can't demand a continued flattened curve via nationwide lockdowns without some kind of interim solution in place to keep people from continuing to lose their homes, businesses, and going hungry. We don't have that, so we can't expect people to just lose everything while saying "Welp, at least the curve is flat".
>we will reopen partially for a month and then be staring down an extra 3 months of quarantine when it becomes apparent that we weren't prepared to reopen  I think it's very optimistic of you to think that we'll respond to rapidly riding cases with another lockdown. I think once we open that barn door we won't try to close it again, public health be damned.
Do you think making masks mandatory to enter buildings would help? If we start reopening too much, at least people would be forced to contain their breath.
Yes, it's truly a tragedy of our time that the federal government was so unprepared and has seemingly taken so little action.  However, I take issue with your assertion that a partial re-opening per the current plan will inevitably cause 3 extra months of quarantine. Only time will tell, and I firmly believe the current plan is already conservative enough, since it allows extending any of the three phases as long as we need to, in order to make sure the hospitals are not overwhelmed.  I'm placing all of my money on the hospitals here in NC not ever being overwhelmed by this - we're already through the worst of it, and people are scared to death and being extra cautious, regardless of what is advised at this point.
They don‚Äôt have that information. This virus is not well understood. There are no experts and very little factual data. Every time they make a statement of fact, they are proven wrong, or some new sort of nasty issue pops up.  They just realized in the last 2 weeks that people (even young healthy ones) were having strokes.   It‚Äôs frustrating to not have all the answers, but Covid is just too new.
That's not a fact, however it is the best option.
The 2 week delay isn't arbitrary in my opinion. Your may not need a full two weeks, but you need some time to make sure that a decline in cases or hospitalizations is not just a random blip in the data. The improvement should be persistent so you can have some level of assurance that it will continue in the right direction.
Did you read the article?
There will almost certainly be a second wave no matter what we do. This was pretty much a given by all models prior to states opening back up.
>	there's a lack of tests, there's nothing political or nefarious about it.  There is on the Federal level.
Germany is very much on the decline for both new cases and new deaths, North Carolina is still increasing.  Germany's population density is more than double that of NC.  Germany has tested more than 3% of their entire population.  NC has tested less than half that.
Yep, also in Ashe.  4 of the 5 are connected, which you probably already know, so... go us?  But you're right, probably not a lot of testing going on.  Avery is still sitting at 0, and I have to believe that's by virtue of not testing.
You‚Äôre right. Originally it was by choice. The plants they receive their parts from do this every year like clock-work because the new edition of vehicles come out, so they shut down for a month or so until they get the new year‚Äôs model of parts in to work on.  You‚Äôve brought up an excellent point though. The stay-at-home order in general is asinine. There‚Äôs always going to be idiots ignoring what they‚Äôre told because ‚ÄúGUBMENT BAD‚Äù and then getting everyone else sick. This virus‚Äô spread seems inevitable at this point.
u/Kanye2k24 knows what plant I‚Äôm talking about and said themselves the plant is NOT excluded from the stay-at-home order.  ‚ÄúThe plant was affected by the stay at home order (EO: 121 Section 2 Item 26) as we produce nothing of value in terms of medical/chemical products.‚Äù
This plant in particular was affected by the stay at home order (EO: 121 Section 2 Item 26) as we produce nothing of value in terms of medical/chemical products. They did shut down most of the plant earlier than the stay at home order due to certain customers (Ford/GM) shutting down themselves in states with unions due to Covid-19 in mid March. In previous years they have not shut down at all save maybe 1 or 2 areas working 4 days a week for  2-3 weeks sporadically. In fact many areas were working 7 days a week near the entirety of last year and even more so in the years prior.
Even businesses that did close didn‚Äôt stop people from ignoring stay-at-home orders and social gatherings. Those people just went out and socialized instead of going to work. Again the virus‚Äô spread proves to be inevitable.
It also really depends where you live. Counties and cities have also been mandating certain closings or safety protocols.
People will go out and shop..
Well, this is an automobile factory that doesn‚Äôt have retail customers but I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll do retail as well. You‚Äôd be surprised too. The amount of people here who WANT North Carolina re-opened is staggering. We just had a rally 2 days ago for it. I‚Äôm just waiting for the infection numbers to go up.   https://www.lincolntimesnews.com/news/reopennc-lincoln-county-members-stage-assembly-in-lincolnton/article_439ef89a-8e4c-11ea-bfc1-afe3973dc1c4.html
True. Deaths can‚Äôt show up if coroners refuse to release reasons for deaths too! We‚Äôve got it all figured out now.   https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/29/politics/florida-coronavirus-death-figures-withheld/index.html
Hopefully your personal anecdote is the same here.
Still 28th according to the link I shared. Depends on if you're looking at something quantifiable like scores and degrees or something qualitative like teacher pay and classroom size.
>For how long? 2 years?  ... until such a time as we can institute widespread testing and contact tracing. If that takes two years, then that sounds like a governmental problem, though, let's be honest ... any hold up in funding these things are the result of conservative malfeasance.   >We can't demand a continued flattened curve via nationwide lockdowns without some kind of interim solution in place to keep people from continuing to lose their homes, businesses, and going hungry.  Then support the politicians who are fighting to ensure that the people of America are taken care of and safe, not those who are taking advantage of the pandemic to enrich their lackeys or fighting to ensure wealthy business interests are immune to liability from their employees becoming sick when called in. If it weren't for the behaviors of the anti-government crowd, we would have the governmental infrastructure to make sure that people would get their unemployment swiftly, like in other countries who hold the duty of government to hold up their citizens.
Let's just say that I and many of my peers who can afford indefinite quarantine won't be returning to our previous levels of economic engagement as long as there is any doubt. I know that group isn't a majority, but businesses that reopen before it's safe definitely won't be anywhere close to their previous revenue levels and will be in for a harsh awakening if they plan for that. I can work from home as long as it takes, I'm spending less money, and my student loans have zero interest so I can probably finish paying them off well ahead of schedule. I wish our country valued the lives of its citizens enough to not force the bottom 50% to choose between risking their lives to make money or being evicted and starve, but the leadership we voted in thinks that's the way to go. Sigh.
Everything helps, but comprehensive and free testing for the public is paramount and America has nothing close to the necessary capabilities in place and apparently no real plans to get there.
Us public health folks would vastly prefer to come off like fear mongers and have everyone yell at us cuz these precautions feel like a waste of time later on. I can't predict the future, but I've always had trouble with believing in my fellow humans and recent events haven't done anything to change that, so I lean pessimistic. I hope you're right and that enough people realize how seriously we need to take all this and the reopening goes well. I don't think Roy is moving too fast, he has a lot to balance, but we won't know something is wrong until several weeks after it went wrong.   Additionally, I'm in a position where I can work from home indefinitely without any issue, so I can personally afford to wait as long as it takes. I realize many people don't have those luxuries, so I try to empathize, but it's obviously difficult because their lives are very different from mine. Thanks for your perspective.
Or maybe it was engineered?
On what data was two weeks decided then?
I look directly at the ncdhhs website for the most up to date stats.
Deaths are not a key metric as decided by the governor and NCDHHS, although I think that is a mistake. They are not even tracking it on their site.
That‚Äôs all the more reason why we need funding for testing, tracing etc. If you test positive for the virus in the early stages then your chances of a good outcome are pretty good.  If you test positive for antibodies it stands to reason you could return to work, resume any activities without Covid concern. Short of that I don‚Äôt know what we can do  other than what we are already practicing.  I think we‚Äôre really trying hard.
At this stage testing has little to do with Coronavirus deaths
Yup, go us! We got meth, incest, and no Covid-19 tests.
> This virus‚Äô spread seems inevitable at this point.  It's been inevitable for a few months now. The whole goal is to slow it down as much as possible.
There will also always going to be idiots who just do what they're told because "GUBMENT GOOD"....     The virus' spread was ALWAYS inevitable.  We were only attempting to make it where less people were sick at a given point.
Thanks for spreading facts I didn‚Äôt know about. I appreciate the help with the information!
You mean people weren't supposed to take their spouse and 2.7 kids to Lowe's and wander around for two hours?
Not if your one of the many people who lost their jobs during the close.
I read this comment and immediately thought they‚Äôd just sell all the parts to the car and you‚Äôd have to assemble the entire thing in your yard/driveway.  I know that‚Äôs not the case, but it amused me.
Yes because depending on the Government is not going to cut it. It's time to let the people decide.
Why 2 weeks? Why not 2 months?
It was quantitative iirc and a few years ago as well. It was some information I sent to a friend thinking of moving here so  not a thorough research of the topic.
>>For how long? 2 years? > >... until such a time as we can institute widespread testing and contact tracing. If that takes two years, then that sounds like a governmental problem, though, let's be honest ... any hold up in funding these things are the result of conservative malfeasance.  >   You're either purposefully ignoring reality to make a point, or you've totally lost touch. Cities will burn before the nation stays locked up for two years.
I do agree that Republicans opposing something like a temporary UBI seem to be basing their opinions on stubborn pre-conceived notions of socialism, despite the fact that we're clearly in an emergency situation that deserves a fresh take.  We can support the Dems cosponsoring this bill all we want, but until the Republicans change their minds on it, there's nothing to be done. It's a rock and a hard place situation. I'm also for temporary mortgage and rent freezing but again, without bipartisan support, our support and wishful thinking means nothing.  In the meantime, what's currently in place just isn't working. I despise the "they just want haircuts" meme coming out of the left, because it's hypocritical and dismissive of the fact that people are facing evictions and poverty NOW. These people can't wait months for a decision that is far from guaranteed at this point.
I hear you and I'm in that group too. I agree that reopening too soon will actually be worse for the economy and I've been trying to make that point to the "Reopen NC" types on my Facebook feed, to no avail.  I think we could have extended the shelter in place much longer if we had just increased the stimulus payout and made the payments repeating. Also, a freeze on rent and mortgage payments with relief for landlords seems like common sense but we couldn't do that either.
> Us public health folks would vastly prefer to come off like fear mongers and have everyone yell at us cuz these precautions feel like a waste of time later on.   Well, you're doing a good job, if the comments on Reddit are representative of the general public. Everyone is scared shitless.  > I've always had trouble with believing in my fellow humans and recent events haven't done anything to change that, so I lean pessimistic.  I'm literally in the opposite camp. I lean optimistic. Life is better now than it ever has been for more people than ever before, even with this pandemic. And it will continue to get better for the same reasons it's been getting better for the last 1,000 years.  Anyway, thanks for your perspective as well. Rare to have a healthy exchange of ideas on here.
 If it turns out this thing was engineered then we have a new dynamic altogether. A deliberate act rather than a wet market disaster.  Trump is saying some sh*t like China did, I've  got the intel blah,blah, blah. So yeah they did it, but they didn't mean to.   Dafuq does that mean?
The expertise of dozens of public health officials? I don't have access to their decision making, but it was what they determined was needed to show a persistent decline.   "Arbitrary" implies they pulled the number out of a hat, which I doubt and I think is a disservice to them.
Tell that to the legislature that just approved hundreds of millions for government projects instead of covid causes.
That's not true at all.  If you don't know people have the virus, then you don't know they *died* of the virus.  We're not testing after they already died.
I can‚Äôt tell what point you‚Äôre making other than the virus being inevitable and society trying to slow down the spread of infection. Your first statement has nothing to do with anything. Actually it‚Äôs a complete contradiction. Saying ‚ÄúGUBMENT GOOD‚Äù and following stay-at-home orders does exactly what your following statement claims.
So some folks are doing the right thing for the wrong reason?
I mean, I was thinking Wal-Mart but Lowe‚Äôs works too lol
Lost their jobs and aren‚Äôt rehired because business isn‚Äôt where it was too.
It‚Äôs a choice, you don‚Äôt have to go. Sorry to hear that you lost your job. But I don‚Äôt understand why  we shop at Walmart but  cannot shop at independently  owned businesses?
There would definitely be a lot less cars on the road if that were the case! YouTube tutorials can only take you so far lol
Glad to hear it's improved significantly since then!
I'm not ignoring anything - hopefully, it won't take two years for conservatives to stop fucking around and press the politicians who represent them to get serious about dealing with this. Every moment they spend on thinking about how to downplay this and using unqualified people and resources to boost our woefully inadequate president's esteem is a moment wasted.   But hey, maybe the conservatives do want to see cities burn and the country to be tossed into chaos. It is much easier in that situation to get people to agree that a conservative vision is what is needed to fix this situation.
>I despise the "they just want haircuts" meme coming out of the left, because it's hypocritical and dismissive of the fact that people are facing evictions and poverty NOW.  This isn't a meme and it isn't coming from the left. *This was literally on the signs by Reopen protestors.* If anything, these people are trivializing the economic hardship people are facing. If they were genuinely concerned about economic hardship, they would press conservative lawmakers to stop fucking around with protections for businesses so they aren't liable for employees getting ill, as well as working to get SBE money out of the hands of big businesses that don't need it.  I know it is reflexively American to want to be "fair" and "both sides" every political issue but this isn't that time. We are here because the president and his political enablers have shown themselves woefully not to the task of steering this country through this debacle and instead of addressing their short comings, they are doubling down on protecting his reelection chances by declaring the pandemic solved. The irony is that had they put in half the effort that Bush did after 9/11, he could have easily won. Instead, he's hoping to win on partisanship.
Everything you just said in your second paragraph should be total common sense, and I don't want any of for my personal benefit. Why do many of the exact people who would benefit most from stuff like that throw themselves behind leaders who campaign on making sure it never happens?!? All I can do is sigh.
So you "feel" like it's right?  I say it's arbitrary because they have provided no data or scientific reasoning to back it up. It just seems to be the generally accepted timeframe for any observable change.
You could do the same.
Okay, not going to go down the rabbit hole with you. Just going to reiterate that if you look at Germany and NC, Germany has more than double the deaths of NC.  Have a good day
I could be wrong because I'm not the person you responded to originally, however I believe they were trying to say absolute statements such as "Guvment bad" or Guvment good" are equally asinine if you're choosing to obey or disobey based on some preconceived idea.   Imo, it's always best to say "government is human and as such subject to errors so try as best as possible to decide from subject to subject and item to item weather or not to follow governments instructions based on the amount of data and experience I have regarding said issue" man, that really flows off the tongue doesn't it?
And some people might be pushing it too far because of it.
It's because Walmart sells food and medical supplies. Any independently owned business that sells essential goods could stay open.
It‚Äôd be great, honestly.   I‚Äôd feel a lot more comfortable doing maintenance on it myself.
Based on what scientific data?  If that were true, 2 weeks after the shutdown we should have seen a decrease. It's been over 5 weeks since the shelter in place order in NC.
Have fun in your fantasy land.
I neither said nor implied that my reasoning was based on feelings. It seems like you reflexively doubt the decision making abilities of others for no other reason than disagreeing with them.  I trust the experts because in my experience they're right far more often than they're wrong. It may be based on solid data or it may be a rough figure based on experience. Either way doesn't meet my definition of arbitrary.
I have, believe me. Jeff Jackson touts it on nearly every NC subreddit like it was a huge achievement.
What rabbit hole are you taking about? You don‚Äôt have a point and you clearly didn‚Äôt comprehend the response that explained how Germany is on the down slope. I know this is all new, but it‚Äôs really not that hard to understand.
There‚Äôs gotta be a caveman way to say that instead.  ‚ÄúIGNORE GUBMENT, DO YOU.‚Äù  That kinda works but still misses a few elements.
True! You‚Äôd definitely know you weren‚Äôt getting screwed over by a mechanic. I don‚Äôt know much about cars but I worked at the factory for a year and an AutoZone for a year so I know a decent amount about the parts that go in them, just not how. It‚Äôs amazing how they work.

That is the Leprechaun Detection Kit. What I am being told by the studio and I quote "That must have been a crackhead!" in a ratchet voice. Back to you guys!
My understanding is that sanitizer works but soap is more effective. That‚Äôs in a topical use. Have the results of the testing of injecting disinfectants by medical doctor come back yet?
What's the issue? Good aseptic technique before shooting up.
Walking around downtown Wilmington?
I want the gold, give me the gold!
> Have the results of the testing of injecting disinfectants by medical doctor come back yet?  Trump should volunteer to have disinfectant injected first and let us know what happens.
The joke is that it looks like they are injecting hand sanitizer into their body to kill COVID-19
At a bridge near Sanford.
If you seen the leprechaun say yeaaaaaa
I mean... you said too.
[https://youtu.be/bZfyrIPw3wY](https://youtu.be/bZfyrIPw3wY)  Forgive me for I have sinned but I had to for the sake of the joke!
I guess they used their internal bright light COVID-19 treatment, to find their way home after injecting the sanitizer.  I wonder if they had the option of the bleach injection, or if it was just the sanitizer?
Ahhh....citation?
YEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!
70% is what you want. The remaining water content is what helps carry alcohol through cell walls. Killing bacteria and viruses.

That's true for some viruses, but most research so far on sars-cov-2 indicates that it does kill it.

Jesus. Are you purposefully ignoring the fact that the numbers for this are that high DURING STAY AT HOME ORDERS? That has limited the spread and deaths. None of your items you're using for your inaccurate comparisons had that.

So as far as data goes, you've presented on link from referencing a model created by 4 actuaries, a single economist and 1 doctor in South Africa. It's presented on a site that if you scroll down just a bit has headlines like **"Professor Lockdown‚Äôs Mistress is a Pro-Greta Virtue Signaling Lefty"**,  so it would be fantastic if you had a less biased and peer reviewed source. BTW, the "data" was reviewed by an attorney, not another doctor, not another economist.  Your second link, directly states that cancer patients are avoiding hospitals over fear of catching the disease. That would have been the case regardless of the stay at home orders and restrictions.

The Mountain County That Went into Coronavirus Lockdown

If a city or county wants to have a mandatory mask policy, they should take the action Graham County did. If the entire state adopts one, we've got to close off the borders. Better we do it ourselves than the four bordering states.

Only 2% show as having been exposed? Guess we really were good citizens and stayed at home.  Our numbers seem to be pretty good but it would make a rebound or second wave more impactful. But we‚Äôre early in the antibody testing phase, yes?

Obama says White House response to coronavirus has been 'absolute chaotic disaster'


North Carolina's 7-day average of new coronavirus cases hits new high

Its gonna keep on climbing. People acting like everything is just normal after the weekend...
At least this alarming headline has the truth buried in the article: there‚Äôs been more testing. More testing means they‚Äôre going to find more cases. The percentage of positive cases seems unchanged. The headline could more accurately read ‚ÄúCoronavirus testing hits new high‚Äù but who clicks that link?
Damn, this stinks. I know I‚Äôm breathing carbon dioxide when I‚Äôm wearing those masks (my sympathy to all first responders).  It‚Äôs going to take a lot more than we‚Äôre willing to do in order to be safe without social distancing, masks and fingers crossed.  And we then have these true OpenNCPatriots bellying up to the Subway counter with a rocket launcher.   https://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/ny-rocket-launcher-sandwich-shop-north-carolina-coronavirus-covid-20200511-pzixtzc47beztfvw2exv65qxr4-story.html  Did anyone ever see sh*t  like this before 2016?   No. Halloween does not count.
Cooper: ‚Äúthat‚Äôs okay, let‚Äôs continue with our re-opening.‚Äù
Give it 2-3 week it will be x2 at th very least
Sweet I get to go back to work soon
But we're in phase 1 now, that means everything's OK, right? I have some TJ Maxxing to do.
It's incredibly disturbing and disheartening.
Im sure thats a rhetorical question, but I would be just as likely to click either.
I went to three different grocery stores last Wednesday to find/buy toilet paper from 6-7am, I finally found it at Walmart.   The first place I went to, Food Lion, only one employee was wearing a mask. Then I went to Harris Teeter and Walmart, and in both places all the employees were wearing masks but half the shoppers weren‚Äôt, or following social distance or the aisle arrows.
I passed a convoy of them driving, waving flags and honking their horns. Really great use of their time and energy
Unfortunately, Cooper is in a pretty shitty position.   He is having to do this with very little support from the republican led GA, who has been slow to provide much in terms of actual support for those out of work, like attempting to fix DES, or providing assistance for our frontline medical and retail workers. Or, heaven forbid breaking into the rainy day fund, because apparently it isn't raining that hard right now and that money is for saving anyway, not spending.   Instead, the senate wastes time on strengthening DWI protections or quite literally [supporting the reopen people and undermining Cooper's legal authority](https://www.ncleg.gov/BillLookUp/2019/S712).  The house is a bit better and a bill is being worked on to improve the unemployment situation, as well as help front line workers [\[1\]](https://www.ncleg.gov/BillLookUp/2019/H1061) [\[2\]](https://www.ncleg.gov/BillLookUp/2019/H1056) [\[3\]](https://www.ncleg.gov/BillLookUp/2019/H1057). Not surprisingly, this initiative is being led by democrats, although to be fair a few republican co-sponsors are on 2 out of 3 of those bills. Of course, those were all filed 6-10+ days ago and so time does not seem to be of the essence for our legislators.   And, obviously, on a federal level, there is no real leadership to fall back on.   So, while I agree that I would like to see Cooper take a stronger stance on re-opening and also call out the GA for their lack of action, I also understand why he has taken the steps he has. The GOP is essentially forcing him to do this on his own, which, as anyone who knows the NC GOP can attest, is almost certainly in order to play political games down the road in November.  The real tragedy is that we, especially those in 'essential' retail and our elderly population, are the ones who will suffer from these political games.
Give Cooper a break. I don't see the difference between a 100 people packing into Lowe's on Saturday afternoon (mostly buying plants and mulch and other junk), and a 100 people going to various smaller retail stores, with the shop owners requiring customers to social distance and wear masks. Before phase 1 most of those people were just going to Lowe's, Home Depot, and Target/Wamart because they were bored, or to hoard up on toilet paper and other items they already had plenty of. I would say only a fraction of people were going to "essential" stores were only doing so because they absolutely had to, and were making the fewest trips to the grocery store/hardware store as possible.
Death is a lagging indicator though
It doesn't seem that way to me. We know there are more cases out there than what's been reported because we haven't had enough tests/supplies to test everyone. As they test more people, they are naturally going to find more cases. It's concerning if the percentage of positive tests start to climb, but if they did 5,000 tests on Friday and 450 came back positive, and then they did 10,000 tests on Saturday and 900 cases came back positive, it's not like twice as many people became infected on Saturday. It's just that we found out about 450 other cases that we would have missed by not doin as much testing.
> The first place I went to, Food Lion, only one employee was wearing a mask.  to be fair (to the employees), Food Lion is not providing masks to its workers. They have to get their own. I wish masks (of all types) were more widely available in stores. Yeah, you can make your own or buy online, but masks (at least the cloth ones) should be as easy to buy as getting a coke or cigarettes or moon pies or whatever
It doesn‚Äôt seem consistent does it? Some places it‚Äôs 100% and others maybe around 50%. At this point we know how contagious and horrible this virus can be.  But we‚Äôre like what? Not gonna happen to me?   That said, people who have to wear a mask all day really do sufferer. They‚Äôre made of better stock than me so, seriously, I am in awe.
All that time and energy to get dressed up to go to Subway.
because the problem is people don‚Äôt/aren‚Äôt wearing masks and gloves. People are out and about as if this whole thing never happened
> Give Cooper a break.   Nah, considering if he was a Republican this sub would be going apeshit, I don't think I will. He set specific requirements to be met before we opened, they were not met, and we still opened. He's a political hack that pretends to be above it all when he's right down there with the rest of them doing what's in HIS best interest, not what's best for the state.
Yes, because if Dan Forest were governor, he'd still be saying aggressively stupid things like      > You know, we‚Äôve still had more deaths to the flu this year than we‚Äôve had COVID-19,‚Äù Forest said, adding: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs been about three times more deaths for HIV/AIDS, remember that was a pandemic at one time that still has no vaccine. This one‚Äôs bad. It‚Äôs obviously worse than the normal flu year, but it hasn‚Äôt hit the extremes of other pandemics yet.‚Äù          https://twitter.com/LtGovDanForest/status/1256273474529759243       > ‚ÄúWe know the demographics of the people that are hospitalized and the people that are dying. And I think we need to let the healthy folks get back to their livelihoods and allow freedom to reign again in America.‚Äù           We are *much* better off with Cooper in charge  - the GOP has largely demonstrated a complete inability to not only come to terms with this crisis, but to effectively manage it.
Wait, where did I said you have to like Forest in order to criticize Cooper? Talk about a straw-man. Forest is off his rocker. That doesn't mean that we can't expect better from Cooper. How about putting the partisan hat aside and talking about the subject at hand?

Coronavirus antibody tests are available for $10 or a blood donation

Great way to get people to donate blood.   Remember though: "A positive result on an antibody test does not mean that the person has immunity or ever had COVID-19, said Blood Connection spokeswoman Allie Van Dyke."
Does anyone know if there are any wide/random sample studies going on now that we have the test kits? It would be interesting to know how many people have already been exposed in different areas of the state.
I was going to get one until the GPS took me to a hospital ER with a couple of  lab corp cars parked outside..... I'll get that test later
If the antibody test being positive doesn‚Äôt mean you have immunity then what‚Äôs the point in doing the test? I‚Äôm asking in all seriousness
There's been a few sample studies in other parts of the country but not in NC. For what it's worth they all suggest that the virus has infected substantially more people than is being confirmed, that the amount of asymptomatic to mild cases is high, and that the death rate is lower, possibly as much as ten times lower than the current rate calculated from confirmed cases vs. deaths. You could look at it as being a highly infectious, mostly mild disease with some at risk of more severe illness. You could also say with more asymptomatic people the need for social distancing and wearing masks in public where social distancing is not possible is merited.
They don't know yet whether it'll mean immunity, short term immunity or nothing. But if you find out now whether you have antibodies then when they do know you'll already have your answer.
That‚Äôs interesting about the other Coronaviruses. Any idea if we can predict how this one will behave based on other viruses in the same family?
That makes sense.  I still think it‚Äôs so insane how so many are willing to let the flood gates open when there are so many unknowns. As far as I know we still have no idea what happens to the embryo/fetus if a woman gets Covid/Coronavirus in early pregnancy. Luckily it doesn‚Äôt seem to be doing any damage to 3rd trimester babies (unless new stats have come out that I‚Äôm unaware of) but it can be deadly for newborns.

Which meat processing plants in NC have coronavirus outbreaks? Here‚Äôs what we know.

>There are 23 outbreaks at processing plants in the state affecting at least 1,340 employees, according to data the N.C. Department of Health and Human Services provided Tuesday to The News & Observer. An outbreak is described as two or more cases.   >The plants are in Bertie, Bladen, Burke, Chatham, Duplin, Lee, Lenoir, Richmond, Robeson, Sampson, Surry, Union, Wilkes and Wilson counties.

Goldsboro city workers seeking better pay, on-the-job protections during coronavirus outbreak

With what money? Tax revenues are about to take a huge hit.
About to? We've been cutting taxes like a Wings pretending to go out of business for ten years.
I think he's talking about the fact that the 30% of people who are unemployed aren't paying payroll taxes.
I'd be very curious to know what the level of revenue lost there is, compared to previous changes in taxes. But okay.

FBI serves warrant on Burr in investigation of stock sales linked to coronavirus

>Under the STOCK Act, lawmakers are required to disclose their stock market activity but are still allowed to own stock, even in industries they might oversee.  >The law passed the Senate in 2012 in a 96-3 vote. Among the three senators to oppose the bill was Burr.

Slow clap
Maybe he can retire to Butner
Just remember the justice department is currently being run by the most corrupt AG in a generation.  A man who dropped charges against someone who admitted to lying to Congress, TWICE.  I am sure this is just for show.  I hope I am wrong, but I don‚Äôt see how Barr and trump will allow this investigation to continue in a battleground state like N.C.  They will probably say in a few days ‚Äúafter investigating, no evidence of wrong doing was found.‚Äù  McConnell will probably censure Burr, drop him from a committee or two, and that‚Äôs that.
finally!!! Dude has been shady as shit for years. Unfortunately he'll buy his way out
Bury him under the jail
This means DOJ is close to nailing him to the wall. This has to be approved by both a judge - who themselves must‚Äôve been convinced there‚Äôs likely evidence of a crime in what was seized - as well as the top levels of DOJ since it involved a sitting senator.  I‚Äôll bet he resigns within a month. Maybe even a week. No way he can fulfill his duties as a senator now.
LOCK HIM UP
I won't be shocked if nothing happens. Our current administration won't let anyone in their party be in trouble. Burr will be off sadly.
We need to rise up.  All of those cheayerswin washington need to go, they're all crooks and thieves.  Him and that bitch from Georgia can share the same cell.
Took long enough!!
Mo money mo problems
Take this POS down
They‚Äôll probably cross reference his phone messages with his iCloud data. To see if he deleted messages.
maybe we're not a banana republic(an) yet?
Yes!!!
LOL at least a little good news to start the day right.
If he gets convicted he‚Äôll also get  a presidential pardon or if it goes to court Barr will step in and grease some palms.  The GOP is somewhat predictable these days.
Drag him out in cuffs. And his bro, Tillis, let's vote him out.
Don't stop with just him, go ahead and round up the rest of em.
didnt the senate just pass a law so they don't even need a warrant anymore? lmao fuck
he also voted away your net privacy today.
Anytime they hit white ppl with their own laws they are about to burn them.
Grrrrrr the crooked Democrats
He's innocent.
I've been wondering why Burr and only Burr was thrown under the trump bus. Because  there's no way trump or any of his cronies took a hit in the market collapse.
Interesting and plausible theory there!  Burr is not up for reelection in Nov and he has already stated that he'll retire in 2022. Under this theory, who does Trump think should be NC's 2nd senator?  I believe that under our constitution the governor would appoint a senator, who must be from the same party as the vacating senator.
Why would Trump be upset about the Intelligence Committee Report?  Every time I've brought it up during a debate on Reddit I'm informed that it's been debunked. I mean, they've never provided any evidence to back up it having been debunked, but they seem to really believe it's all false.
Hmmm, I was told only the right had a monopoly on idiotic conspiracy theories....
Don't, you'll get on literally dozens of conservative email lists. or just use a fake email.
You‚Äôd be better off writing Loeffler in Ga and asking her. She has a lot more volume and won‚Äôt be distracted by putting out the 5th volume of the senate Intelligence Committee report that confirms Russia interfered in the 2016 election in support of trump.
You should have called him out about his lady shoes.
Hell yeah, The Wire! Sorry, not tie or senator related- I just saw your name.
We'll keep a bottom bunk open for him.
Yup, DOJ is as corrupt as it gets at the moment. I'm fully expecting "no wrongdoing found, carry along". This is just for show. I'd love to be proven wrong.
Actually maybe not, because this investigation was not brought because Burr did something wrong.  Whether  or not what he did was criminal is irrelevant.  It was brought to punish Burr for his "anti-Trump" actions as head of the Senate Intelligence Committee. Those actions including issuing a subpoena to Orange Cheeto, Jr.   This is why the right-wingers jumped on this issue.  See, for example the article about Tucker Carlson calling what Burr did a great moral crime.  And the left wing is piling on, of course. So the left is  carrying water for Orange Cheeto on this one. West Wing is having a good laugh on this one I assure you. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/03/20/coronavirus-tucker-carlson-burr/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/03/20/coronavirus-tucker-carlson-burr/)
They are going to draw it out until there can't be a special election, then the GOP nominates candidates that Cooper has to appoint from and goes on without losing the senate seat until at least 2022.
I like that the narrative here is already: ‚Äúif he‚Äôs found guilty? Good! If he‚Äôs found to have acted appropriately? Well, the AG is corrupt because he‚Äôs obviously guilty!‚Äù Lol, this is like the comments I‚Äôm already reading about if Trump wins again it‚Äôs because of Russia/cheating/fraud/whatever. Confirmation bias is fun.
Moscow Mitch will call it all a democratic conspiracy
Not with Bob Barr in charge.
Oh you sweet summer child.   (I want this to be true too but I have little faith.)
You're way too excited. The end of this story is he bought a new cell phone.
>I‚Äôll bet he resigns within a month  He might, but it's irrelevant. He'll be replaced with a Trump loyalist who's even more corrupt.
Once he's found guilty.  We're better than them. :-)
Burr will 100% fade away before anything happens. This is his last term.
I think you‚Äôre right *depression sinks in*
I don't think so for him. He pissed off Trump by not burying the Senate Intelligence committee's report on Russian Interference in the 2016 election.  If this really were about insider trading we'd be seeing similar headlines for GA senator Loeffler, OK senator Inhofe, etc.
He's expendable, his expiration date is set since he said he wouldn't run again.  It makes him the perfect Patsy so all Republicans can point to him and say "look, we took out corruption in our own party!!!" so hopefully nobody looks more at what the rest of all those corrupt pieces of shit did.
There is no honor among thieves.  Now Burr can rat out the others.
Some clarity on this.  - If Burr resigns prior to Sept 4, then there would be a special election in November for someone who would serve out the end of the term.  - If Burr resigns after Sept 4, the replacement would be in place until the election in November 2022  - If there is a special election, there will not be a primary, the Executive Committees from each party would nominate a candidate.  - The placeholder until that special election would be chosen from a list of 3 candidates the NC Republicans give to Cooper.  - This obviously means Republicans will not want him to resign until after September 4, and Democrats will prefer him to resign prior.  Edit: Clarity on bullet 2
It's probably less about the report and more about people not falling in line.

I bet it was a John Edwards tie
He might actually have consequences.  He agreed with the Senate Intelligence that Russia was assisting in getting Trump elected.  I'd say it's very possible he's going to be the example of what happens when you anger the regime.
They'll force him to resign after September 4th and have the NC GOP appoint someone more in line with the Trumpublican party.
Goddamn, how do you always manage to have the least nuanced, "enlightened centrism", zero context comments on these posts? It seems like a lot of work to be this willfully ignorant
I think people are arguing the AG is corrupt because he's openly making decisions on whether to pursue cases based on political considerations.
Right, and if it makes Trump look bad he can always blame this on Obama's deep state FBI too.
This had to be approved by the AG's office.
Ha, I mean, I work in federal/electoral politics for a living but that definitely doesn't mean I'm right - if I had a perfect track record of predictions, I'd be posting this before going to work for Clinton's re-election campaign.  It's definitely optimistic. But I just don't see how he can do things like run the Senate Intelligence Committee while an agency the committee has oversight responsibilities for is investigating him.
If that's your take, then the actual end is you and I bought him a cell phone because he's definitely going to expense that to his Senate office.
When a vacancy opens, the party of the open seat submits three names to the governor for them to choose from. Definitely safe to assume all three or six names (if a list is rejected for some reason) would be party/Trump loyalists.  THEN, if he resigns more than 60 days before the scheduled general election day, there's a special election. If it's 60 days or less, the next election would be the next general, but in this case that'd be the regular election date for his seat anyway.  All that being said...I'm not sure the state GOP could railroad in a Trump loyalist who would withstand a 2020 general election in that timeline. A double-barrel election is tough to manage anywhere (look at GA), and NC will be even more challenging given the state of the Tillis/Cunningham race.
There's plenty of people in the prison system awaiting trial...Burr can join them.
Burr‚Äôs insider trading dealings came out first, before the others. I don‚Äôt know what that means, would they have looked for this activity had he not been caught?  What would they be after? They have him on this, don‚Äôt they...?  Edit: word
It could set the stage for the rest even the Democrat lady from CA.
Thank you
Since he‚Äôs being sold down the river I could definitely see Burr resigning before September.
Ding ding ding!
Look I‚Äôm not going to insult your tie because I know what happened to the last guy
This is what I‚Äôve heard in other subreddits.   This DoJ investigation may actually be legit because Burr is the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, and they made Trump look bad during the Russian collusion investigation.
Being called an "enlightened centrist" by a Bernie Bro is like a badge of honor, thanks!
They won't risk allowing a Democratic Governor to appoint a senator. Even if he's required to pick one from the same party, there's no way Cooper would appoint a Trump stooge.
\> THEN, if he resigns more than 60 days before the scheduled general election day, there's a special election.  Can you source this? I'm not seeing anything that indicates NC can hold a special election for US Senate if the vacancy opens 60+days before the general election. It looks like it's a "pick one of these 3 Trump loyalists" and that's it until Burr's term ends in 2023.
What would be the harm if Cooper didn't pick a name? Keep the Senate at 99, until a name he can swallow is put forward.    Especially if this occurs after November and he gets reelected.
haha, good point!
We can only hope
Me too.
Not a Bernie bro, but nice deflection
The selection from a list of three names is a legal requirement - though the creation of the list is political, the governor *must* pick someone from the list.  I'm just not sure Burr can ride this out for another two years - I don't even think he can do it for another month, hence my earlier wild/maybe fanciful prediction.
https://www.ncleg.gov/EnactedLegislation/Statutes/PDF/ByChapter/Chapter_163.pdf  Edit: sorry, forget the text:  "The Governor shall issue a writ for the election of a Senator to be held at the time of the first election for members of the General Assembly that is held more than 60 days after the vacancy occurs."
He legally has to make selections by a certain time. This law was designed to keep seats in control of the party elected to them and to not allow a seat to stay empty.

Not a fan of the governor openly violating the law for a partisan advantage, but that's just me.
>Is every Trump voter a MAGAhead  I mean, yeah, I'm sure most people here would absolutely say that they are, haha.  A Democratic Socialist Benie Voter is just as bad as an Alt-Right Trump voter, in my book.
Completely agreed. It's not Cooper's style, anyway. If Burr resigns, it'll be interesting to see who gets the nod. My guess would be Hudson, Walker, or Meadows - Trump in particular would be pushing Meadows to the NCGOP for the seat.
Lol your bubble is airtight, huh? I know plenty of Trump voters who hate the guy now, and just voted against Hillary. I criticized Bernie more than most so how that makes me a Bernie bro is beyond me

UNC Economist asks why State Remains in Coronavirus Lockdown

How about we listen to the medical professionals that have a deep understanding of medicine, healthcare, epidemiology, and pandemics instead of an economist. Economies recover, dead people don't.
Corona is an capitalist wet dream. kill off the old and sick unproductive citizens. devalue existing middle class assets (real estate, 401k).  reset average wages lower. ramp up unemployment to make the masses desperate for wage slave work
Wait could they not get a UNC medical doctor‚Äôs perceptive? lol Or at least someone who studies viruses?
BuT dEaD eCoNoMy MeAnS dEaD pEoPlE
We have their opinions everywhere on Reddit (at least the doctors who are pro-lockdown). Why would we not want more expert information about the economy from economists?
We already know what will happen with the economy. We don't know what will happen with this new virus. Economies recover, dead people don't.
There‚Äôs no need to be rude. I think we all agree that deaths from Coronavirus are bad. I think we can also all agree that the economic damage from the shutdown is bad.  There is a balancing scale between these two things and we disagree on which weighs how much and we‚Äôre the tipping point is.   How much economic damage is acceptable? How much can we bear before something has to give and we have to allow things to open up and accept the risk? How many deaths do we have to prevent with the lockdown? Are we supposed to stay locked down until the virus is completely eradicated, or is there some acceptable threshold we can live with?
Everything that projects the future is an opinion piece. Your opinion can be substantiated by data, but every piece about the COVID that does not directly state facts is an opinion piece.  Are people biased? Of course they are. Medical experts demanding indefinite lockdowns are biased; economists asking to reopen are biased. Milkmen who want people to drink milk are biased. What matters is the information provided; is it true or false? Feel free to explain why you disagree with the linked article.   As for our response, there's plenty to do, but just because a policy is based on the need to stop COVID does not automatically make it good. Encourage mask use and social distancing; focus testing and prevention toward those most at risk (nursing homes for example).   I too have family members that I love and would hate to see die. However, I love them enough to see them as adults that can make their own decisions, even decisions that I disagree with. My dad and grandma drink too much; my grandpa eats too much. I am aware that this will probably cost me precious time with them, but I would never consider asking the government to come in and force them to live healthier lifestyles.   I love them too much to not let them live their own lives how they see fit, and I can't imagine anything more selfish than forcing them to live how I want them to live just because I think it is 'for their own good'.  I'll close with the fact that I am a religious person, and I am therefore very aware of how broken we all are, not the least of which myself. However, I do not believe that one of my, admittedly many, bad aspects is my love of freedom. I do not believe that I know what is best for my neighbor; only they do, and I would not be so arrogant as to believe that I am able to run their lives better than they can.
I thought we were supposed to listen and believe whenever an expert speaks /s  But in all seriousness, this man is providing his expert insight into an important question regarding how we have handled, and should continue to handle, this pandemic. He is also behaving like an adult and not pretending that or that there are no trade-offs to completely destroying human freedom for a little temporary safety. It is something that people usually understand but have been pretending not to for the last few months for some strange reason.  Why you would be disinterested in listening to what the experts have to say is something I can only guess at....
> I think we all agree that deaths from Coronavirus are bad. I think we can also all agree that the economic damage from the shutdown is bad.  While you may think this is self evident, there is a persistent and vocal minority on one side of the debate who *consistently* downplays the risk of those deaths in favor of a gratuitously magnified effect on the economy.  Take [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/NorthCarolina/comments/ght5z9/many_of_north_carolinas_restaurants_may/fqedxgb/), for example:  >> "And we shouldn't have shut down to begin with, for a virus that is on par with a bad flu"  >> "this is an old person's disease. The death rate for someone under 50 who catches the covid is 0.4%. (Or to phrase another way, a 99.6% survival rate.)"  So no, it does not look like that person *is* in agreement that deaths from Covid-19 are bad.  It looks like they're going into the argument that those deaths are so unlikely as to be irrelevant, except in the case of "[people with underlying conditions](https://www.reddit.com/r/NorthCarolina/comments/ght5z9/many_of_north_carolinas_restaurants_may/fqev433/)", which suddenly seems to mean that those folks are expendable.  The flip side is that some folks are certainly magnifying the threat of the virus, but I've yet to see a significant cohort of them downplay the risk to the economy.  If anything it looks like they're simply willing to live with the effects to avoid a public health catastrophe.  They're simply not trying to rationalize away the effects to the economy with the same single-minded dedication as their counterparts.  ___ ^(Coincidentally, *many* of those detractors were counting on a good economy for Trump's reelection and are now distraught that their golden goose was killed by a respiratory virus, but that's a whole other can of worms...)
The only human freedom that has been destroyed is the lives of those that have died due to COVID-19. 90,000+ and counting US citizens have died so far, and that is with taking drastic steps. Millions would be dead by now if we had done nothing, fewer people would be dead if we had done more. I don't care at all what this person with an agenda from a politically biased think tank organization has to say about the economy.
> He is also behaving like an adult and not pretending that or that there are no trade-offs to completely destroying human freedom for a little temporary safety.  Literally no one has suggested there are no trade offs.  Literally no one.  Not a single human being.  You made that up because you're not listening to what they're actually saying.
I don't understand your point. Yes there are people who ignore the risks completely, and I know there are people who blow it out of proportion. Bringing your assumptions about how people on one side of the argument, and I mean way to one side, vote just sows divisiveness and does not move us forward.
> And we already have a metric that balances both. Unfortunately the economy has to take seat for a small amount of time to American lives. The economy isn't coming back tomorrow, next month or even next year.  What is that metric?  > How does that have anything to do with the people complain about not being able to go to church or protesting in Raleigh with guns? Because it doesn't seem like there much to do with the economy from either.  How does this relate to the price of tea in China?  > That's often the issue with conservative thinking, there is no progress forward, just staying in some make believe past where things were 'good'. Hopefully this is a good learning lesson for many, because there never is any going back. We won't be back to 3.5% unemployment for years to come, and many companies, many jobs simply will not come back.  Making this political isn't helping anyone, it's just sowing divisiveness. Now the under or overreaction is part of the political game, rather than actually working together to fix a problem.
You make a fair point on the comparison to Arkansas and Wyoming. I would even add that it seems cherry-picked since he only chose 2 out of the 11 states to not issue SAH orders. Not sure what the others are or if they are doing worse/better than NC.  However, you are overstating the risks by using the national figures while the article is clearly intended to be only about NC. By including the entirety of the US, you are including the poorly-handled outbreaks in NYC and other northern cities and states when you should be focused on NC and NC alone, which is doing better than the national average wrt COVID deaths. It looks like we have 659 as of this morning per the best stats I can find.  He also does do a good job of giving context to the deaths in NC, which, if heeded, would enable us to more precisely coordinate our response. If the risk of death in NC is disproportionately in nursing homes and similar places, as the data suggests, it would enable us to figure out a better balance between security and freedom.  As for our freedom of choice, every single decision we make of course effects others in a small way and that my liberal idealism cannot always perfectly exist in a world that is not black and white, but that does not mean that we remove freedom arbitrarily, without any due process. Just because I might one day die in a car accident does not mean that I should have my license revoked.  There actually is a standard for temporarily removing freedom if needed, clear and present danger. I am willing to accept the idea that someone with COVID or COVID-like symptoms does represent a clear and present danger to those around them, so if you support mandated quarantines of the sick I would agree. I would also be fine with treating this like extreme STDs, where the intentional or grossly negligent transmission of the disease would be classified as felony assault.  However, locking down healthy people with no symptoms nor positive tests is straight up tyranny. The burden of proof that you are a danger to your neighbor is on the state.
> The only human freedom that has been destroyed is the lives of those that have died due to COVID-19. 90,000+ and counting US citizens have died so far,   This is a lie, 100%. The fundamental rights of protest, assembly, religion, and liberty have been completely destroyed over the last few months. There is more to living than just existing. Might as well lock everyone in a bubble for the rest of their lives. Then we'll live til we're 90!!   All of that is not to mention all of the people who will die from non-COVID issues created by the lockdown, mental illness, domestic violence, stress, and not going to the hospital when they should out of fear of COVID.  > Millions would be dead by now if we had done nothing, fewer people would be dead if we had done more.  Hell of a counterfactual, but the states that never instituted lockdown orders are doing comparatively well, and that's without an expected second wave. The states hardest hit were some of the most restrictive.  >I don't care at all what this person with an agenda from a politically biased think tank organization has to say about the economy.  Lol, so listen to the experts when they say what you want to hear, but you don't care when they disagree with you. Never change, authoritarians.
> The only human freedom that has been destroyed is the lives of those that have died due to COVID-19  This is the opening of the response OP sent me (feel free to read the rest to show I'm not taking this out of context). He is definitely refusing to acknowledge the trade-offs by literally saying that there has been no destruction of human freedom during the lockdown aside from the people who have died of COVID. So there is at least one single human being denying the worst part of the trade-offs.
> I think we all agree that deaths from Coronavirus are bad. I think we can also all agree that the economic damage from the shutdown is bad.  You were wrong on this singular assertion.  We do *not* all agree.  *That's* my point.
>This is a lie, 100%.  Tell that to the families of people that have died from COVID-19.  >The fundamental rights of protest, assembly, religion, and liberty have been completely destroyed over the last few months.  There have been idiots assembling at protest parades with guns every week for the past 6 weeks. If you would pay attention to what's happening, you would have seen this and you would also have seen that the reopening process started in NC and other states 2 weeks ago or more.
No. Not true at all.  Even now you're not listening to the things other people are saying to you.  edit: I really should have read your comment history before I responded.  Sheesh...
You obviously want to blame Trump and his supporters for this, and that's your right to do so, but it's not helping anything.
>  We aren't just 'lucky'.   NY and NJ weren't particularly more open than NC. It seems that we were lucky compared to the rest of the country's average. This is one of the points made in the article, that there doesn't seem to be much correlation between COVID death rates and strictness of the lockdowns. Why did the strict lockdowns in the North not save them as much as the strict lockdowns in the West or South, or the less-strict and non-existent lockdowns in the middle of the country? Either the lockdowns are not effective (unlikely) or the South and West just got 'lucky' as you say.   You also seem to assume that people would not quarantine themselves voluntarily, something that doesn't really have any evidence. You and everyone who agrees with you would lock down just as much as you currently are, and people like me would still socialize far less. In fact, most of the egregious examples of SAH violations, the protests, are a direct result of the lockdown order itself.  > Then when you go out without a mask, without staying 6ft apart, and for non-essentials, then you would fall under that  Yes, **if you have also tested positive for COVID**. It is the duty of the state to prove that you are a danger; it is not your duty to prove you are not a danger. If you sleep with someone in January who has HIV, and they didn't tell you. Then you sleep with someone in Feb, not knowing that you have HIV, then are tested in March and find out that you have it, you did not commit a crime in Feb, since you did not know that you were positive.  > It's not tyranny it's the choice you are asked to make if you wish to be part of society  Lol. Really? You choose to live in this society so whatever happens is not tyranny?  Just this weekend, the US Government passed legislation that allows them to spy on its citizens' search histories without a warrant. That is tyrannical, and just I hope and think that you would agree. Just because you agree to live in the US does not make their every action an acceptable thing for the government to do.  > work at the grocery store (or all businesses except a few categories that are open right now, or wait three days until the rest are opened). Doesn't seem like tyranny as all.  First off, I am not one of the unlucky ones that people like you have forced out of a job, and for that I do consider myself fortunate. However, just because my life hasn't been as negatively effected as some does not mean that I do not feel empathy for the lives that people like you have utterly destroyed (perhaps literally, as I understand that there has been an increase in suicides recently). I support gay marriage, despite not being gay, because I am able to understand that freedom is the right of all people, not just the freedoms that I would personally use.  Second, just because the state will *eventually* get its boot off our necks does not mean that it is okay to do so. Yes, the state will be less tyrannical by this weekend, hopefully, and it will be even less so in the Fall/Winter, but that doesn't mean that this nonsense is acceptable right now.  For a TL;DR: It is tyrannical for the state to treat people like criminals who have committed no crime and do not pose a clear and present danger to others. A person who has not tested positive for COVID is not a clear and present danger to others.
>Tell that to the families of people that have died from COVID-19.  Okay? It is possible for people to die of COVID while at the same time human freedom is being destroyed.  >There have been idiots assembling at protest parades with guns every week for the past 6 weeks. If you would pay attention to what's happening, you would have seen this and you would also have seen that the reopening process started in NC and other states 2 weeks ago or more.  People were arrested for protesting peacefully, and getting a new gun in NC is basically impossible because they have all but halted giving out new licenses. I am aware that the reopening process began 2 weeks ago; we still have a long way to go before the people of NC have anything resembling the freedom due to all US citizens.
What is not true? That OP has completely refused to acknowledge the trade-offs, even after you said that not a single human being has done that?

Coronavirus Total Cases. Visual Timeline until 18th May 2020 üò∑ Wow, USA started skyrocketing in Coronavirus Cases.


NC coronavirus trends stable enough for Phase Two; Cooper decision expected this week

It is hard to see them reopen when the number of hospitalized patients are trending upward.  What exactly is the trend they are looking for? I thought the whole idea of staying home was to flatten the curve and keep the hospitals from being overwhelmed.  It #of hospitalizations isn‚Äôt the metric to watch, then what is?
Yeah and how long exactly is that going to last once everyone is out and about among those who refuse to protect themselves or view this as a hoax?
Their metric for measuring this on a percentage basis is asinine. Basing the positive cases against the overall count is sub-par data recording imho. The numbers day over day are rising and this is a fact that can be seen. It will continue to keep rising the more we relax our policies to circumvent more infections. How many more people need to be infected? Are they just waiting for the hospitals to explode with cases before they retract these opening phases and put us back at square one? And how many people are they willing to just let die because of their sheer ignorance?  I'm going to continue to stay home as well. These businesses will not be receiving any money from me and I'll continue to deny them my patronage even after we officially can re-open safely. Cooper will not receive my vote again in the future. I'd rather have a leader with a spine over one that's made of wet noodle and scared to take criticism from a vocal few. Instead of keeping the rest of the population safe.  And for those that are all gun-ho about re-opening remember this...Don't do like the many that already have gone to the news once they've been infected and hospitalized with either them or their family members dying and beg people to "use them as a cautionary tale" because you've denied yourself that right when you decided to put yourselves, your family, your friends and the overall public at risk.
It‚Äôs time! Finally going to get to enjoy a hot off the grill burger and draft beer this Friday hopefully!  Trust in gov Cooper and the scientists that advise him
Hospitalizations supposedly have been steady.  Cases increasing, but in line with increased testing, so they're catching more asymptomatics.  I trust Roy Cooper- I can see an argument either way, I'd be fine with one more week, but I do want to get back to more of a normal.
No idea. Rural counties are trending up, more beds are being occupied, and metro areas are flatlining from a downward curve.  I'll give Cooper Phase 1........ but we're opening too early for Phase 2 and they have to know it.
Already seen people on my nextdoor saying they won't wear masks and those who don't like it can stay at home. My sister-in-law who works in a grocery store got screamed at for asking a customer to wear a mask.   Ok then I'll continue to stay home as much as possible to protect myself and my family from these idiots. I'm sure I won't be alone. You can't restart an economy without customers.
Also, the "stable trend" is [ever upwards](https://covid19.ncdhhs.gov/dashboard#cases-over-time).
> The numbers day over day are rising and this is a fact that can be seen  This is what happens when you test more people. Let's do some basic math to demonstrate what's going on. Let's imagine a group of 1000 people, 100 of whom have coronavirus. Test 100 of them at random, and you'll have somewhere around 10 positive tests. Test 500 of them at random, and that number will go up to 50 positive tests. The numbers day over day will have risen by a factor of 5. This is a fact that can be seen. Despite the rise in day over day numbers, there was no actual rise in infections. 100 people in that group of 1000 were infected the whole time. Doing more testing made the numbers rise, but there was no actual rise in the number of people infected with coronavirus.
You can't simply go off total numbers either, it is infection rate and hospitalizations that are more indicative of spread.  Hospitalizations have been fairly flat.  Remember that the real goal of shutting everything down was to not overwhelm the hospitals, that has been achieved.  It's a balance and you risk much more harm by keeping everything closed indefinitely.  Per auto updating news article, the rate of spread is slowing: [https://www.newsobserver.com/news/local/article241168731.html](https://www.newsobserver.com/news/local/article241168731.html)      This  chart shows the number of positive cases doubling every 2 to 3 days in  the first three weeks since the first COVID-19 case was confirmed in NC.  As of May 19, the time for the number of cases doubling is about 20  days. We flatten the curve by reducing the number of new cases per day.  This reduction in the slope flattens the curve with the impact of  lengthening the number of days to double.  We absolutely want to be safe and do things wisely.  But, the hard stance you have taken is not helpful.  This is a balance.  It isn't all or nothing.  What do you consider a reasonable alternative to opening without waiting indefinitely for a vaccine?
Good stay home forever we don‚Äôt fucking care your probably a bore anyways
Liberals want us to stay lockdown until there is no economy left
I'm not saying that I don't understand how testing and case counts work. I'm saying that they're still rising when looking at it purely from a case count number. I'm concerned that it will become a larger issue in the near future if we continue to relax our SaH and distancing measures.   We're only testing at best 10k/day right now. Considering the NC population is around 13 million people I don't even think that 7.5%/day equation is accurate either.
I'd honestly like to see broader testing than the 10k (at best) that we're processing right now. A count closer to 50k/day would be much more assuring to me right now, also having the knowledge that if I get infected and need to be hospitalized that I'd be covered as I don't have health insurance because I don't get paid enough to afford my own and the policy my company offers is just as expensive.  Edit: even then I'm still honestly afraid to interact with anyone outside of my household as the people I live with are at significant risk. Even I myself am at risk because of lung issues. Broader testing and seeing that trend either stay as low as it is now or receding would be satisfactory imho. We're about 13 million in this state. 10k test per day doesn't seem like enough of a group of people to get a good figure on infected case counts per day. Testing less than 1% of the population/day just seems like a very optimistic snapshot of what should be a larger group to get a more accurate figure.
Aren't you just a delight! I bet people think the same of you with that attitude.
That's a strange way of saying "Most people across party lines support distancing measures, because they want fewer deaths."  Or maybe you really meant to say that dumb thing.
That's fair.  Just keep in mind that this is all subjective and everyone is going to have a different comfort point.  It's just not fair to everyone to have to restrict their entire lives until you hit your comfort point especially when you are viewing this as someone who is at risk.  The fact you are at risk means that you should treat this differently than other people.  If you remove the high risk groups, this does seem to be a pretty manageable situation.  Keeping everyone locked up because there are some people at a higher risk isn't a good solution.  The better solution will be to let the people at lower risk resume some activities while balancing the need to protect those at higher risk.  I haven't heard a solid figure, but roughly 50+% of all the Covid related deaths have been in some type of community living, many of those being senior living facilities.  That's a pretty important point when considering how to get things going again and what public exposure means.  I'm of the opinion that if we knew in January what we know now and everyone was understanding of the need for social distancing, we would not have near the problem that we have now.  Therefore, I think we can safely start moving back towards somewhat normal life if people do respect hygiene and social distancing.  Yes, you are going to have people that don't behave no matter what - you see that now even still while in the current state of emergency.  But, for the most part, I think people will work to keep this moving in the right direction.  Consider the risk of not reopening.
Your points are well made and of course taken. Thank you for the excellent dialogue.
Likewise.  Good luck and stay safe.  Hopefully, all this is in the rear view mirror soon.
Thanks, you as well.

Corona virus, meat plants, and local Asian/ Hispanic groceries
Let me know if this makes sense.  A lot of our country's meat plants are staffed with migrant workers. So, if you are a migrant worker and your income, housing, everything is dependent on you showing up to work each day but one day you feel sick, what are you more likely to do a) stay home until you feel better b) go to work?Right. You are going to work. If you do not go to work, you do not get paid. You can not visit a doctor bc you do not have health insurance.  If you lose your job, no there is no unemployment insurance from the state or the fed. You're fucked. So, you go in and suffer through it. This is why the meat plants are full of cases. This is also part of the reason the asian and Hispanic markets are starting to show hot spots of positive employees.  But these hot spots are being reported by fellow employees, not by the state. Why? No healthcare, no insurance,  no possibility for unemployment insurance.  I think this is one huge hole in our system that will keep this virus with us forever.We need free healthcare for ALL when it comes to this virus, or we'll never escape it.We also need UI for all, including undocumented workers. How else can we really get rid of this?
This doesn't seem have much to do with NC, however it's not just migrant workers.   One of the reasons case numbers are so high in Michigan (even though they have shut down and are very similar to NC), is potentially due to factory work.   Anywhere you keep people close together and there is a virus or other infection, everyone is going to get it.   I'd be more concerned about assisted living homes, senior centers and nursing homes; as they account for 50% of the deaths due to COVID in NC.   Know why people aren't talking about it? What do you do with people that need care around the clock? Tell their families to 'deal' with it?   That's why its so important to try to minimize contact for vulnerable populations, which means we **all** have to keep maintaining social distancing and wearing masks (along with washing our hands).   UI for all won't help when the state and federal government are telling people to go back to work, nor will health coverage, because the sick will be sick either way.   We all need to do our best and demand businesses actually follow the guidelines set forth, or else there will be a lot more dead people, and this lasts that much longer.
PTO/paid leave/terrible insurance is fairly universal in many fields.   Teachers pay their insurance premiums, high deductibles and also pay their subs : /    Our nation as a whole works too much & rests too little especially when sick
Good to know you never go to work sick - especially during flu season. You set a good example.   Now for the other non-immigrant people who go to work when they‚Äôre sick how are you going to address that? Especially they‚Äôre working with the public who might not have jobs and insurance.   And the kids that get sent to day care and school when they‚Äôre sick because parents need to work no matter what their ethnicity or language they speak at home?
"This is also part of the reason the asian and Hispanic markets are starting to show hot spots of positive employees"  source?
We don't need UI for all nor do we need healthcare for all thats ridiculous. Using the virus as you're reasoning for it is even more ridiculous. If you want healthcare, paid sick time and unemployment insurance dont break the law. Dont come to my country illegally. Go thru the proper process to come legally. My taxes shouldn't go to someone here illegally when there's millions of Americans that are in need
I generally never go to work sick, but most places I've worked have had a combined sick/PTO system.  Give me dedicated sick time and I'll never work sick again.
We needed that for all before this crisis, so how would it change, aimgo?
I've seen the system abused when companies split out specific sick time as well.   So, no perfect solution here.  I would be interested in seeing how the companies with unlimited PTO are doing in light of the current crisis and how they handle extended sick leave in general.
Many people don‚Äôt have that luxury
How did anything I said have to do with race? Dont be so ignorant
I dont care what country you're from or what color you are. What gives you the right to come here illegally and take resources away from the millions of homeless and starving AMERICANS of all colors that could be using them. Kiss my ass calling me a racist you dont know me
We have unlimited PTO and have been WFH since the middle of March. We have some specifics in place for COVID related time off so the company can get government moneies, and the policies are pretty fair.  Since most companies with unlimited PTO are full of the most privileged employees, I'm guessing most are doing however their industry is doing. And they are largely tech companies, so mostly fine, financially. They're dealing with new child-care related time, but also, employees without kids, like me, are taking way less time off than usual.  We've seen some additional time off for employees that need to deal with their kids (both regular child-care they aren't otherwise getting and schooling), but still keeping it moving.
I'm pretty sure that was OP's point...
Thats idealistic.
Thanks for apologizing and you're right maybe my orginal comment did come off the wrong way. I dont hate anyone especially not just because of where they're from or the color of their skin that would be ridiculous. Our whole system is flawed to start with but nothing is ever perfect. Ideally I would love for us to help everyone in the world but that's unrealistic so for me it's like if you had family that were in need you would give to them before you gave to a stranger. That's how I see our country, since this isnt a perfect world and resources are limited I would make sure our people are straight before I go giving to those here illegally. But that's what makes this country so great is that were all entitled to voice our opinions popular or not but thanks again for apologizing
And have a happy mother's day!
