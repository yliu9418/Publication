Even if the cities are able to get this under control, Raleigh is likely to get absolutely fucked by people coming in from areas where infections are spiking.       Our city is strong and we can get this under control, but when we have "bug chasers" trying to get people sick because they are bored may require more direct citizen action to keep the stupid people in their own counties, or at least keep them out of the city center.

COVID-19 Testing available at Durham Walgreens -- must meet criteria

The screening process was about 8 questions and if you qualify you can immediately schedule to be tested.  I qualified despite only being "Priority 3" using the CDC's guidelines (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/priority-testing-patients.pdf).
I wonder what they are going to do when people start getting upset because they can't get a test? I know a few psycho people that think they need a test every time they step outside!
And it's still the super long swap jammed up your nostril test?
No, this is a self test nasal swab.  Not nearly as brutal as the longer ones at hospitals
The brain tickler?
Just curious, those hospital ones are rough to witness.
I saw a video on twitter the other day of a solider getting one and it was horrific. That foot long swab vanished into his head.
I saw a flu swab being done the first of March, before I even realized what happened, "OH DEAR LORD" flew out of my mouth. Then I laughed so hard, it scared the crap out of me.

Drivers License Issuing During COVID-19
Since the NCDMV suspended road tests, there really is no way for them to issue driver licenses and permits at the moment, leaving a lot of people who need them for work, groceries, etc. without access to driving privileges. Has anyone heard of plans to resume issuing them? (with proper protocols of course)EDIT: Grammar
No one knows when we’ll reach the different stages of everything opening. As far as road tests my guess it will be at least another 30 days if not longer.
The NCGA is working on a grace period for expirations of up to six months. There is already a 90 day extension in place, but it looks like new drivers can only complete all of the other tests and then take the driving test later.

Whole Foods in Chapel Hill has confirmed cases of COVID-19

Time to open the economy and stop the shelter in place.  - protesters and republicans
May the odds forever be in your favor.
So you want nothing to re open until everyone in the entire world gets a vaccine?   Come on man, that’s just ridiculous.
This will infect everyone, it doesn't care about the economy.  Why can't we put a hold on debt and bills until it's not a threat then reopen.   You are arguing to reopen things that may put yourself and others in danger, why the fuck do you want that.  We should be protesting for universal healthcare, a living wage and pausing debt payments, not opening the current economy so you can risk your life.   Fuck that.
I have a nsew theory about the re-openers. One thing that the stay at home has revealed that nobody has much acknowledged is that a lot of labor in this time and place is superfluous. The old narrative of your personal worth is tied to your hard work is showing itself flawed.   To me, this is great news. I’m a poet, lover, prognosticator, and curmudgeon. There is wealth enough in the world to keep me fed, sheltered and healthy.   But to these folks, their core identity is threatened here. Being community oriented and gregarious is beyond their conception. That their labor heretofore might be pointless is too painful for them to admit.   It is sad. These folks deserve our compassion, for they are in excruciating mental pain.   Incidentally, Trump is among their number. Due to economic distortion, he has an inordinate amount of influence and luxury around him that makes it easier to hide the truth from himself and others. But his work has always been superfluous, and he knows it.   We need to find a way to stop their destructiveness, but they still do deserve our compassion.  Edit:  I must study politics and war that my sons may have liberty to study mathematics and philosophy. My sons ought to study mathematics and philosophy, geography, natural history, naval architecture, navigation, commerce, and agriculture, in order to give their children a right to study painting, poetry, music, architecture, statuary, tapestry, and porcelain.  —John Adams
So you do want everything to be closed for the next 6-12 months?
In what imaginary world do you think that would even work?
Reopening should not be based on a date, it should be based on data.     This is a virus, it won't go away on its own.
Yes. If thats what it takes to get us to a point new case are declining, folks going to the hopital are decling, and new deaths each day are way down and we have testing (both antibody and do you have it now that) a hard yes.   Are you out of work because of it?  What do/did you do that you are so wound up to get things open?  I know many places hiring right now if you are feeling like you want to get out and do something.    You know we had almost the same umbeer of folks in the us die in the last 24hours from covid 19 as we did on 9-11?  We have had more dead in a few months than we had in the whole vietnam war.   If it takes 3 weeks or 2 years for the world to figure out how manage this thing then thats what it takes. You feelings and need for money or whatever does not sway me and many others that we should lighten up and let more die a slow horrible death from this thing.
The healthcare and wages part are happening in Canada.   There are others but you won't care.
No, I am not out of work.   I’m just sympathetic of people who are and are struggling.  It’s clear that you are not hurting for money.  This argument is pointless. The government is going to re open everything, regardless. I hope you’re able to stay at home and be safe and healthy.
Don't poke their fragile ego they think the USA is best at everything including healthcare. These people are fucking idiots.
> It’s clear that you are not hurting for money.  I am not.  I saved for something just like this.  That old tried and true advice of saving 6 months livng cost for a rainiy day seems to be good advice. I listend.   I am sympathetic for those out of work but those who want to work mostly can with things just like they are right now. There are many many jobs chugging right along and hiring. state is hiring 250 contact tracers right now, constructtion is still going on, delivery drivers are in demand as are folks willing to stock store shelfs or work in warehouses.  Census called me and begged me to not bail on them becaue they need folks and should soon be figuring a way out to get that rolling along safely (19 an hour, roughl 8 weeks of min 40 hours a week) I told them i wont but truth is i am prolly not gonna be willing to do it anytme soon.  Gonna wait and see.
Well you’re assuming everyone has enough disposable income to save money at all.   Not everyone is as lucky as you.
Its not luck i am where i am.   I lived far below my means for many years and often worked jobs i hated and spent a lot of time away from family and home for promotions to be where i am.  I get not everyone is able to.
That’s not related at all. You’re privileged.
Really?  How so.  I had less than 3k in my bank accunt at 17.  3k i earned from working since i was 12 delivering newspapers and cutting grass and washing dishes at a chilis. I never made more than 80k a year.   I fricking saved like a mad man and worked hard. I drove old cars, i took jobs nobody wanted because they paid more or gave more chances for promotions. Nobody left me a bunch of money.  I bought my first house at 25 and made the down payment with us saaving bonds i purchased every month since i was 18. I stayed in that house well past when i could afford to move because i wanted to save more. I rode a bike 5 miles each way to work for that first year after i bought that house  (in florida heat) because we could not afford a second car.  I am 52, retired and in a paid for house.  I know how to live cheap. I will be fine but it aint luck that got me here.
I got ya. I’m just frustrated since I know a lot of people struggling in all parts of the country. I’ve got no problems at all right now so who I am to talk.
It’s luck that you’re 52 and have saved money (a product of being older and more secure) at the time that this particular crisis strikes.  Although I’m sure in the past you’ve experienced somewhat similar crisis of your own and were unlucky in those cases.  This is like literally the thesis of Malcom Gladwell’s Outliers if you haven’t read it, btw.
I get it.  Everyone is frustrated.   this to shall pass.

NC Covid-19 stats with simple graphics to help understand numbers
[https://covidactnow.org/us/nc](https://covidactnow.org/us/nc)
If you go in Facebook all the Trump supporting/anti5G/Alien Implant/Tea Party/Bill Gates is the Antichrist/Flat Earth/Simulation theory idiots all say there are 0 deaths in NC as of today
Why are their models so much more extreme than others?  https://covid19.healthdata.org/united-states-of-america/north-carolina  https://rt.live/  https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/covid-forecasts/
Looks like we should all keep staying at home!!!!
But we supposedly peaked 3 weeks ago based on the UW model.  Not!
I live on the coast and one of the local groups for the area people were saying the same fucking shit. And the beaches are packed like it's 4th of July. This shit is never going to end
Thanks for that fivethirtyeight link!     Projections average out to 87K dead in US by end of May - and that's with no change to social distancing / opening up ,etc.
actually NC looks fairly good compared to many States.
I doubt the people making the model were fully aware of how stupid people can be.
I really don't get it - they only protest what affects them directly. Like they're saying their rights are infringed? How? Because they can't go eat at fucking golden corral after church?   Look I agree with people being able to work for those who can't work remote I feel awful for them, the stress they must feel but dam these people are somehow fighting for what they're against - they don't go out and protest like this for things like universal healthcare but now they are there with pro choice signs ...shit makes no sense
Nate Silver has been an interesting twitter follow through this. They also started a covid podcast I haven't listened to, but I thought the piece I linked was particularly good.
Agreed, but I was mostly referring to the projected future hospitalizations if everything lifted today. Those numbers are still pretty overwhelming to me.
I have to wonder how behavior factors into these projections? Even if all restrictions were lifted, I imagine that a large portion of the population would exercise at least moderate caution for the foreseeable future.   Personally, even if all bars, restaurants, etc were to reopen fully tomorrow, I would probably continue to do takeout until we see how this plays out.
That seems to be a projection of what if every precaution was lifted. Also if I am reading it right its as if every positive case was still positive and roaming Targets across the state. A lot of those people are healthy now. Still its a good metric to see what could happen if not careful
Click into the county-specific projections and you'll see those overwhelming numbers are coming from other parts of the state, NOT Raleigh-Durham
Agreed! That’s what my husband & I would do, as well as most locals that we know. I hope that most will do the same to keep the continued spread to a minimum.
Sadly you'd probably be in the minority
If there is no massive second wave then it’s only thanks to the reasonably cautious people like yourself.
I don’t know, all the people I’ve talked to, friends, family, co-workers, various chat groups, etc, have all said the same thing. Hardly anybody wants to chance getting deathly ill for a few drinks or a night out. The only people I’ve “seen” that are dead set on going back to standard operating procedure are the protestors I’ve seen online/in the news.
I am with a youth soccer club and a lot of people are worried still about high risk family members. They are letting us know that even after we can let kids play soccer again they will be avoiding large groups.   We are considering refunding or credits rolling till 2021
I live at the coast and the beach was like 4th of july this weekend and its mostly tourists.
Ah, damn. Wanted to believe people are smarter than that. Welp, the world was nice while it lasted.

I had the COVID-19 Quest Antibody Test in Raleigh, and it was super quick and easy as I guess it should be for $130.

Ok, fair enough.  I did end out having the antibodies at least according to Quest’s test.  I’ll update my blog to include the results.  Appreciate your sentiment
Keep in mind, while [Quest has stated](https://reason.com/2020/05/01/seemingly-small-differences-in-the-accuracy-of-covid-19-antibody-tests-can-make-a-big-practical-difference/) their specificity of the test is 99-100% and the sensitivity is 90-100%, their tests have not been independently verified.   You might have antibodies for COVID, another cornonavirus (there are plenty of them) or not at all.   These individual tests are not all that useful quite yet, but are massively useful in randomized population studies to figure out what the % of a population has potentially be exposed to COVID.   We don't know quite yet if you can get reinfected, carry the virus and spread to others, or a whole lot of other things.
I’ll take it when it’s free 🤗
You had to make an appointment right? I was looking into it this weekend but it seemed like nothing was available and I didn’t think they’d allow walkins, even if you you already bought the test.
You wrote a whole blog on the experience and didn't say whether you tested positive or not? Way to bury the lede.
My appointment is on Friday, looking forward to knowing for sure
Interesting! Thanks for sharing.  Did you notify your co-workers (or HR at work or whatever the protocol is)? I'm curious about the implications between co-workers now in these times. Like, how someone feels about the fact that they caught a virus from a co-worker in February 2020 might be a lot different than how they felt about it last year. Any fallout there? Any policies or new protocols at work?
Everyone should keep in mind that we do not yet have conclusive evidence whether or not the antibodies will protect you:   [https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/immunity-passports-in-the-context-of-covid-19](https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/immunity-passports-in-the-context-of-covid-19)
But why did you get this done?  No one has announced any reason to get this done yet.
Would you mind breaking down the course of your illness from February? A day by day or just the beginning symptoms? I understand if you don't want to.
Yeah, luckily I was only working with 8 people during the time frame.  I notified them all.  Although I can’t be 100% certain that was when I was infected with COVID.  I just let them know that it was a possibility and how to get tested.  There was no real fallout, basically they just appreciated me letting them know.
Did you have any trouble getting  your results online? I just registered for MyQuest, answered a series of personal questions, but my results aren't showing. Any advice?
Thank you. I did appreciate the blog and have even read a few more. Glad to hear you're ok.
It may be worth knowing that because there is very little oversight of these tests, a ton of them are not at all accurate and can provide false positives.
Some of these tests have a very high false positive rate.
Ah, so you are promoting a blog.  edit.
Agreed.  It really doesn’t change my behavior re social distancing, there are too many variables and unknowns in place.
Follow up to that: those are the test statistics given a known sample of Covid19. Once you account for the fact that not many people have this, the effective false negative goes way up.
The Euroimmun test got independently tested and it’s not as good as Quest claims:  [look here ](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.09.20056325v1)
Yep, with the required red tape to get a doctor's approval and with a doctor that doesn't currently do telemedicine it would cost me well over $130 bucks to get tested.   It's so American that you have to go through multiple parties and pay a few hundred bucks to get a simple test in the middle of the worst pandemic in 100 years.
Is it expected to be at some point?
Yeah I had to make an appointment.  Last week I was able to make an appointment at the one in Benson.  At the time, that was the only one in available.  I wish there were more Quest locations like Raleigh.
I walked in the day I paid for it online.  This was in Cary.  Totally empty, waited about a minute.
Point of my post was to let others know how to get tested and the process.
Yes, this is very important to note. We don't know if people can get infected by the virus again and we don't really know how many strains there are. It could become a new flu, having multiple strains every year each requiring slightly different antibodies or vaccines to deal with.
I would say figuring out whether or not you have antibodies to a virus that has put the entire human race on hold is a pretty good reason to get testing...
I’m not saying this is her case but I know a lot of people are freaking out with allergies and colds and they believe it’s Covid. Someone just mentioned that they had a cough with no fever and was tested. I think doctors are to blame because everyone(healthy individuals)runs to the doctor as soon as they get the flu instead of staying inside and riding it out. I’ve had a pharmacist friend say tamiflu isn’t a miracle medication and most of the time it’s too late to take it. Doctors encourage people to come in and infect healthy individuals seeking prescription refills every flu season because they want that$$$$.
If you have antibodies to the virus, you are no longer at risk.  You can stop worrying, stop wearing a mask, stop using hand sanitizer, start licking doorknobs again.  You could volunteer to help out at a rest home, homeless shelter, or hospital. [You could donate plasma, and your antibodies could save other people's lives.](https://www.wral.com/woman-s-plasma-donation-saves-two-lives/19081038/)  This is only starting to be done in the US, but it is proven to be effective.  This is assuming that the test is accurate.  Accurate tests exist, but there is some question whether Quest's test is accurate.  Or, to put it properly, it is unclear how *specific* Quest's test is see /u/-PM_YOUR_BACON 's comment.  It might pick up antibodies to related viruses, which cause the common cold.
Hmm, how many days has it been since your test?  It showed as no results available online until my results became available.  But, once they became available I got an email and they popped into the online portal.
True, the Quest’s test is one of the 10 emergency authorized by the FDA, so it is the best we have available.  But to your point, their own website states Note: This test can sometimes detect antibodies from other coronaviruses, which can cause a false positive result if you have been previously diagnosed with or exposed to other types of coronaviruses. Additionally, if you test too soon, your body may not have produced enough IgG antibodies to be detected by the test yet, which can lead to a false negative result.”
And false negatives.
ny found they are at about 12%.  15,000 random people tested across the state.   https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/amid-ongoing-covid-19-pandemic-governor-cuomo-announces-results-completed-antibody-testing
It’s going to be interesting.  It definitely seems like it would be beneficial for the government to fund test for most everyone particularly once we confirm that having the antibodies equals not able to get COVID again.
NC almost certainly has lower infection rates than every state from VA to NH, and lower than many midwest states as well. I don't think antibody testing here is going to produce the hopeful results that one might want.
Many of the regions they tested in NY had fewer than 10% or even 5%. NYC had under 20% and that brought up their average overall but it's not close to 30% positive everywhere, by any means.
And Quest won't tell you which test they used.
Quest doesn’t need a Doctor’s approval.  You just make an appointment on their website and go.  I got an appointment same day and got my results the next day, all without a doctor.  I don’t think the tests are great, but the service is good at least.
given how things usually are, there will be an app where you have to watch a bunch of in-app ads or upgrade to the pro version.
This is good to know, I got mine scheduled today. How long did it take to do it?
Sure, but since adequate testing isn't being done anywhere, it would be nice to know how you fared. That's really the more important part of the story, especially for people that don't have a spare $150 dollars to get a test. Read: quite a lot at this point.
Flu has a vaccine.  And tamiflu decreases the flu by one day.  Do some research.  Doctors couldn't give a shit about you, they will help you if you want it.  But with your poor know it all attitude they will roll their eyes.
That is not true at all and no medical professionals have shared your views.  Be careful spreading misinformation like that.  Yours is a theory that has not been proven yet.  It gives false hope.  And actually encourages people to go get the disease in some circumstances.  There should be no "hallpass" cards.  This is not the way to beat this disease.
Have there actually been any studies or evidence that show that you can't be infected again? I haven't read anything backed up by science that states that or even implies that.
My test was yesterday, so it's odd that it was back so quickly. I wouldn't expect anything, except I rec'd this email that says:   >***New test results from Quest Diagnostics are now available in your MyQuest™ account.***   >   >***You can login and view your lab results in MyQuest***
Emergency authorization literally only means paperwork has been sent to the FDA. No test has been independently tested and cleared by the FDA.
They drew one vial of blood.  Just a few minutes.  Got the results online 2 days later.
I had one. I paid $170 though. Results were negative despite me, my wife, and my son having at first a dry, then wet cough I would describe as severe with difficulty breathing for several weeks in March. We never had fevers though.  I've never had allergy problems, haven't had a cold since early 2018, and haven't had the flu in over 20 years.  Not gonna lie, I was pretty bummed out when I got the results. I work in a field where you cannot go to work with symptoms. I burned all my sick days and we didn't leave the house for those weeks. We had groceries delivered and wouldn't let the delivery person anywhere near us.   I guess it was just an unrelated respiratory infection.
How does knowing whether a single person has antibodies help anyone else? How is someone's personal health information more important than knowing how to get tested?
There's so much information flowing at any given moment it's impossible to get any semblance of what is accurate or not. Right now there are articles that say that the tests are both low accuracy and high accuracy, and also low-false positive and high false positive. Some articles saying there has been no re-infection worldwide and other articles say the opposite. Some articles say the FDA is stepping in and others saying they are not.   I personally am not looking to get an anti-body test right now but if it can give people just a little more clarity it is worth the price tag for many many people.
Flu vaccines are spotty depending on the year but I’m all for them. That being said I believe we’d have way less flu deaths if people treated the flu like covid and would stay at home unless they have trouble breathing or have an extremely high temp. Doctors shouldn’t encourage people to come in and spend $100-$300 for a visit and meds just to shave off one day or being ill. I actually have a good relationship with my doctor and let her suggest my healthcare plan. I just don’t go to the doctor every time I have a virus.
[Dr. Fauci, April 10:  "Coronavirus immunity cards for Americans are ‘being discussed’"](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/04/10/fauci-coronavirus-immunity-cards-for-americans-are-being-discussed-178784)  Fauci is in no way expressing certainty that it is a good idea, or that people with antibodies are fully immune.  But he's a hell of a long way from "there should be no hallpass cards"  I would construe his position as "Hallpass cards are an idea with merit that we are actively exploring".  Granted, this was almost a month ago, and research moves quickly in this field.
The virus has only been in the human population for five months, so no one knows about long term immunity, but there are no reliable reports of relapse.  The body produces antibodies that destroy the virus, and taking them out of one person's blood and putting them into a sick person makes them better.    There is a big question of whether you're immune *for life*.  We will probably need frequent vaccine boosters.  But if you've caught the covid and recovered, you're safe for now.  [Really good summary in this BC article, with a great takeaway quote](https://www.bbc.com/news/health-52446965)  >"The question is not whether you become immune, it's how long for," said Paul Hunter, a professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia.
Well, it could happen.  I got my results back in 36 hours.  Not sure why it isn’t showing up there.  Maybe download the MyQuest App to your phone and see if it shows there, that is how I viewed mine.  Otherwise,  I don’t know.
Well, I don't pretend to know the in's and out's of the FDA procedures, so that could be the case.  I still stand by my statement that it is likely the best test available.  It is manufactured by Abbott and used both by Labcorp and Quest.  While we still have questions about the reliability of these tests and even what having the antibodies actually means, this is the best test available.
I'm really sorry to hear that. Stay strong.
Who knows how accurate the tests are still
The tests are still only so-so when it comes to reliability.  So you still could have had it.  There are better tests coming out, but Quest doesn’t have them.
Same situation regarding the several weeks of coughing in March.  The person my family caught it from has already taken the antibody test, we hope to hear results early this week.  If she has antibodies, someone in my family will get the test.  We all did have fevers.  My wife had a bit of sinus symptoms, my son and I never had a trace of sore throat or runny nose, just weeks of dry cough.  Two months from the time when I started having a fever, I was beginning to wonder if I had permanent lung damage.
When did you get the test? And this was the antibody test?
If you do end up getting COVID-19 in the future, you still have 2 weeks sick pay provided through the FFCRA law. Not that you will be happy to get it if you truly didn't already, but if one of the big concerns is sick pay, this could help allay your fears somewhat.
I was driving for Uber back in December. Darn near every Duke student had a cough. Was hoping it would go away after Christmas break, but it didnt. All area universities had coughers after the break.   I had the cough sometime early on, probably late Dec, and it lasted a couple weeks. Only felt sick (stuffy head, sore throat, and possible mild fever) for about a day though. (In Nov/Dec 2017 I did have bronchitis bad, followed soon after by a mild flu. Not even the sniffles between then and the cough. I generally dont get sick easily.)  If my memory serves me, it was noticeable in the community until sometime mid Feb. It must have been highly contagious.  However, it was not the Cove because that would mean darn near every student in the area had the Cove.   One of the Duke students told me what was going around. For the life of me I cant recall what it was. Only remember them saying it would go away after a couple weeks without any medication. And it did. Not the Cove.   Ahhhh... the good old days of getting sick without thinking you have a deadly virus.
That’s partially because all of those things are right. These tests can be more accurate one way but less accurate the other way. And these usually go in opposite directions. So given an individual with the right antibody, Test A might fare better than Test B detecting it. But absent the antibody, Test B might be better at “not detecting” it.  Re-infection is almost certainly not occurring. Some people seem to carry parts of the virus longer than we thought but are not infected.  You are right though it’s hard to keep up with the conflicting news. Science at this scale is more probabilistic than deterministic. So every finding we read (and media reports) is really on a grey scale of true and false. It’s hard to convey that message though, even for the best science journalists.
Thanks. I guess I need to consider myself lucky though and not be such a Debbie Downer.   There are people out there that have lost their job, their business, still haven't received unemployment payments, or are dead.
My serology sample was collected Saturday morning at 7:30 am, and I got my results around 5pm yesterday. Yes, this was the antibody test.  Test Name: SARS CoV 2 SEROLOGY (COVID 19) AB (IGG) , IA  Reference range: NEGATIVE

Renewing vehicles during covid 19
So my partner and I are in a pickle. Our tags expired which normally wouldn't be too much hassle but with everything going on we left the state to stay with family and can't get our emissions test to renew our tags. I've been calling the DMV for a couple days and I've never gotten through to anyone. Does anyone know how I could get a hold of a human at the DMV to figure this out?
I can tell you police aren't really pulling people over for vehicle registration right now...But aside from that..looks like the NC bill passed today vehicle renewals due currently dont have to be down until August now
Right now the the state just extended a 5 month extension on them.   There won’t be any late fees for it either.   So don’t worry about it.
There's nothing to figure out, just get it inspected when you get back and renew the registration.
I got pulled the other week in Wake Forest for just that..good times
That's great to hear, thank you for letting me know that. There's so much news flying around it's impossible to catch everything. Huge stress relief, we're staying in a pretty heavily policed area so I've been a bit stressed about that.
Just to add: it was extended for expiration dates from 3/1 to 8/1.
The issue is we don't know when we'll be able to come back and we can't exactly drive around with expired tags until we do.
Damn that’s really really surprising tbh. Was it a trooper?
I know a lot of police officers from various departments....pretty much since march most departments are not doing traffic stops on minor things to reduce possible exposure to COVID 19.
Is the state you're in currently enforcing registration renewals?  Really you're only option is to register it in the state you're in, but that likely requires you to also have a drivers license there.  There is no way to renew a registration without a valid NC inspection within 90 days. It would be up to the state legislatures to pass a law to change that.
Just a regular Wake Forest cop - was pretty surprising
Do not register in the state you’re in. You would have to re-register and pay the impact fee (percentage of value of vehicle). It cost me $600 to reregister when I moved back to NC.

Umstead Park Covid-19 opening?
I heard from someone that Umstead Park would be opening soon (within the week). Unfortuantely my internet search skills aren't the best, so I was wondering if anyone had heard any news about it?
I believe state parks will open as part of phase 1. Should find out for sure today when cooper outlines phase 1 though
I would imagine they will open after May 8. And it will promptly be swamped with people.
There's no official information at this time.
There is so much mass confusion with phases, re-openings, stay at home orders, county by county regulations, and public spaces that I'm just going to wait at home for a few weeks and let the dust settle. This state is on an [upward trend](https://covid19.healthdata.org/united-states-of-america/north-carolina) of infections and deaths and we're doing confusing re-openings so I'm good with chilling at home for awhile longer.
The big question is do you want to be the first person at a place once it's reopened with all the eager reopen folks who are nice COVID incubators at this point.
"William B. Umstead State Park is closed until further notice, as of sunset on Friday, March 27 to reduce the spread of COVID-19 across the state. All accesses, trails, parking areas, restrooms, campsites, and the visitor center are closed.  Please use the following numbers to contact park staff:General questions: 919-218-2809"
But not all state parks closed at the same time, so it's entirely possible that the State Parks group will make individual decisions based on the area the park is in and the over-crowding that occurred prior to closure.
It says that parks *may* reopen subject to social distancing.
My parents drove by Raven Rock park shortly after the parks were shut down since they are new to the area and just checking things out. They talked to the ranger at the closed gate and she told them that the weekend before the park was shut down but everything else was, they had like ten thousand visitors!
It's not that confusing. The 3-phase plan was outlined and widely reported when Cooper announced it. Here, you can brush up from the official source: https://files.nc.gov/governor/documents/files/NC-3-PHASE-PLAN.pdf.  Here's hoping we stick with the May 8th start to phase one, since it will still be until the end of June (at the absolute earliest) before we reach the end of phase 3. Even the worst estimate from the link you provided has estimated cases ranging from 0 to 1,500 statewide by then, which is minuscule and shouldn't scare anyone away from going out in public.
>This state is on an    >   >upward trend   >   > of infections and deaths and we're doing confusing re-openings so I'm good with chilling at home for awhile longer.  I think the thing to remember is that all of this has been about flattening the curve (ie: not overwhelming our hospitals), not stopping everyone from getting it.  As it is now, our hospitals are not suspected to have an issue with COVID-19 cases.  So, while it does seem weird, there's also some rationale behind it.  It's also the case that people are starting to go out and about to places regardless.
I would too but I have jury duty on the 18th.
I will 100% be there to support our local businesses as soon as they are allowed to open. I am not part of an at-risk group, and I am not regularly coming into close contact with at-risk people, so why not?
>As it is now, our hospitals are not suspected to have an issue with COVID-19 cases  [I don't know about that.](https://www.wcnc.com/article/news/health/coronavirus/north-carolina-low-completely-out-critical-supplies-ppe/275-560d5b3e-172c-4e07-bf1d-f0e4524a5190) 0 days left of something as basic as gowns is terrifying.   We're 4 months in and we can't even get PPE or mass testing. I totally get the idea about flattening the curve but we've seen a complete and total failure of government to respond to this pandemic and it's baffling that we're just going "welp have fun out there folks!"
Because that's how you catch the virus, spread the virus, and then get sick from the virus.  When you're in a flood of people, who may be carrying the virus, you can't say whether you're not in close contact or not.  NC has just reached a plateau on new infections and being one of the first wave of people out sets you up to be infected.
I'm sure it will be packed and with COVID's delayed incubation period it's just putting yourself at risk. I love movies but i'm not headed back to the theaters the moment they open up.
You can pass it on without catching it yourself.
May 8th at 1700 phase 1 starts per Cooper.
So what? I'm not worried about getting infected. It's still very unlikely, but even if I do, I have a less than 1 in 1000 chance of dying because I'm not old and sick to begin with.  I will still adhere to social distancing and mask-wearing when I'm in places where there are more vulnerable people who are performing essential activities (like grocery shopping).
That's such a low risk, that I'm ready and willing to accept it. If you are also under the age of 35 and otherwise healthy, you should be too.
No shit, sherlock. That has nothing to do with what I said.
This is not true people in their 30’s are dying like everyone else.
Ad hominem attacks make whatever your argument is mute. Go away. Ick.
Was watching the news when he said it.   Here is an article  https://www.wral.com/coronavirus/cooper-easing-nc-stay-at-home-rules-allowing-most-businesses-to-reopen/19084913/
No, they're dying statistically far less often than people in their 70s and 80s.

An Online Workshop for Parent Resources During Covid-19
If you know anyone who might be interested in attending this free workshop this afternoon please help spread the word! :)   Resources for Parents During Covid-19 Workshop Wed, May 6, 2020 2:00 PM - 3:00 PM (EDT)[https://global.gotomeeting.com/join/498804173](https://global.gotomeeting.com/join/498804173)&#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/vtfrapzep5x41.jpg?width=1545&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=667bfcded79a6f1d8a2c424af8bb8bccdac45766

Washer/dryer sets under $1000? Anyone buy recently (during COVID-19)?
I'm in the market for a washer/dryer set for 1k or less. I don't need delivery/install.I have no clue where the deals are (or what reputable places have them outside of big box retailers) or if anyone has experience buying appliances during COVID-19. I've looked at Best Buy but they are still closed and I don't want to blindly purchase a set. Any advice appreciated.
Sears outlet has scratch and dent stuff.  You can likely find a set for under $1000 there.
There’s a Sears Retail Outlet in Garner. I got a brand new set (some warehouse surface damage) for 500$ total. I’ve had them for a year and they work perfectly.
I got a Maytag washer and dryer set at Lowe's for under $1k. They're nothing fancy but they do the job just fine.
Home Depot has sets for under 1k. There’s also a used appliance store off Capital (just google and it will come up) that looks to have good reviews/carries refurbished washers and dryers.
As far as brands, if you have a choice go with Maytag. Samsung is garbage.  The boards can go out in less than two years and the repair cost is not significantly  less than a new unit - esp. Dryers.
Best buy has a store where they sell 14 day return items and floor samples with a mfr warranty. They maybe slight cosmetic issues. We bought a washer dryer and a fridge for 1500 last summer. It's in Raleigh.
Might want to call Best Buy up, I had heard that they were planning on reopening on an appointment basis for appliance shoppers.  Garner Appliance (in Garner obviously, and Holly Springs as well), is where the builders all go to supply their new homes.  Ultimately, everyone price matches everyone so go with whoever has your preferred unit in stock and takes your preferred method of purchasing/financing.
I just bought one last year. The best model you can get, if you're looking strictly at longevity, is the Maytag Commercial:  https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/b7iysj/update_buying_the_best_washer_and_dryer_maytag/  https://www.reddit.com/r/Appliances/comments/azzpyf/i_reviewed_my_maytag_mvwp575gw_washer/  Getting it local may be difficult, I do know that Home Depot recently carried it (not sure if they still do).
we paid exactly $940 for our whirlpool set. Lowe's and HD were the same price, and way below anywhere else we looked that wasn't scratch and dent. Garner & Conn's are so expensive.
Had no idea they had an outlet - thanks I'll check it out!
Just posted this same info. It’s really the best way to do it.
Awesome - what brand/model if you don't mind me asking?
Thanks - I'm a single dude in a townhome so I don't need a family-sized or super nice set; Maytag sounds fine to me (use them currently at the Laundromat haha)
samsung has become trash.  Maytag is good -- I've also had very good luck with LG.
I believe it's on capital. There hours are weird but they are open fridays saturdays sundays. Not sure right now tho because of the cov-19
[Best Buy, Maytag, $960](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/combo/washer-dryer-bundles/65a546fc-519c-4dd1-98c8-38a4b1e2b7fd)
This store is permanently closed. Even before Covid.
Thanks, I saw that set but it appears they are out of stock until late June (buying this weekend).

Raleigh among top ten cities projected to make the best long-term recovery from COVID-19
Raleigh News & Observer: Two NC cities among top 10 with best chance to rebound from coronavirus, report says.https://www.newsobserver.com/news/business/article242687966.html
Durham was the other city.
Yeah, tech industry is pretty strong here and I guess that sector is one of the safest (in terms of job security) in the face of corona
The pandemic must be over...N&O is back to a paywall /s
Oh man I hope so, it’s been a mess job wise so it’s good to see some hope.
There’s no where to go. #keepraleighboring
I theorized before that because of our lack of real public transportation and reliance on personal cars, we'd end up better off over this thing.  Neat.
I moved here from New York a year and a half ago, bought a house, and couldn’t be happier. I see a lot of long and short term opportunity here. Whether people here want to acknowledge it or not isn’t up to me. In my opinion, Raleigh is a wonderful place and will continue to be, even with its growing pains.
Two years ago, I was accepted to a few grad schools in eastern states. I was so tempted to go there but turned them down ultimately because of the living costs. Now I am so happy that I am in Raleigh because I can't imagine living up there now with virus and all.
I know right..lol
> tech industry   I wonder if the rise of permanent/semi-permanent WFH, will change where people live in Wake County. I don't see people packing offices like they used to, it's just not safe for the foreseeable future.
Incognito
Lots of places to go if you know where to go.
The genius of our leaders! Ignoring internal infrastructure needs wasn't incompetence, it was pandemic preparedness.
population density (sprawl) probably helps as well
i think you might be a little confused about where nc is located geographically
How very Raleigh to have both cities be listed and have Raleigh only mention themselves. :-)
A good point, I'd expect more people to move out to the sticks if they can ensure net connectivity. The cost of housing is cheaper than in the metro area and if you only have to go into work once a week a one to two hour drive wouldn't be so bad.   This list also has Durham, so I'm not sure how to feel about it.
Millions will flock from the big cities if they can work for the large companies and live here.
Downtown🎶🎶
A perfect example of failing upwards! Go Raleigh!
lol this sub can be so pedantic sometimes. You know what he meant.
This is /r/Raleigh. Sorry, /r/BullCity is /r/DeadCity
>  I'd expect more people to move out to the sticks if they can ensure net connectivity.   I'd be tempted to live in Wilson for their Gig fiber internet: They're one of the few cities to have their own ISP  https://www.greenlightnc.com/services/packages-pricing/internet-broadband
Fuckin Durham
Many people moving here from other metro areas want to be in the cities. They want fancy restaurants and craft cocktails on the weekends, and they don't want to take an Uber for 45 minutes to get to it.
Right before Rona came to town there was a thread that said the Triangle WFH rate is 9%  I was astounded that it was so low. I’ve been in sales for a long long time so have always WFH (aka my car!) but, I’ve been in literally 1000’s of corporate offices and legit, it’s heads down, people hunkered over their laptops or scanning 3 screens on their desk. I understand that some jobs simply require on-site bodies but I truly believe 45% or more of the jobs in the world could and should be WFH. Bosses are the problem. People need leaders, not bosses. It’s been interesting to see all of the polls and studies coming out about increased productivity since WFH became ubiquitous
Yep sort of ironic since we are such a hot bed of technology. I do hope organizations will take a serious look at the benefits of WFH after to being forced to allow it. The air quality improvement reports from around the globe have been very encouraging.

Dorthea Dix Wedding - COVID 19
My fiance and I postponed our wedding (thanks, Corona) now we're looking for a ceremony spot. Preferably outside.Has anyone gotten married at Dix park?Does anyone know if we can just show up with \~50 people, get married and leave?  Most places (JC Raulston, WRAL azalea garden, Raleigh Little Theater rose garden etc) are closed and not taking any requests of this sort until...TBD.  I'd also love any ideas or suggestions you guys have! Our reception is downtown so anything near DT Raleigh would be appreciated.
You’re all echoing conversations my fiancé and I are having. Seeing your responses further drives home that we should elope and party next year.   Thanks for your help guys!
50 people is 5x the current gathering limit.
If you're set on having 50+ people at your ceremony, then continue to postpone.
Get married at the courthouse and throw a reception or whatever when covid-19 is behind us.
I don't know anything about Dix, but apparently there is no limit on the number of people who can attend an outdoor wedding as long as they are socially distanced. https://www.wbtv.com/2020/05/12/gov-roy-cooper-provides-clarity-regarding-religious-services-under-nc-stay-home-order/?fbclid=IwAR3Ap23lO_Gm7HPnQue5CTiqolsP6yJT47pVKDES3LFilZrGjC73wRMGxa4
If I recall correctly, phase 2 would increase the gathering numbers to 50.
Yes. But we aren’t there yet and since they didn’t say a date all I’ve got to go on is right now.  Besides, just because we can get together in a group of 50 doesn’t mean we should.
I don't disagree with you. It would be legal in phase 2, but arguably unwise to do so.  Also, who knows when phase 2 will kick in. For all we know, it could be another month or so.

North Carolina sees its worst day of new COVID-19 cases

OK, this is garbage blogspam with no context. From the original article this BS links to:  > Cohen said the state remains in good shape in nearly all benchmarks, including the percentage of tests for COVID-19 coming up positive, number of patients hospitalized by COVID-19 and the number of cases determined by lab tests and surveillance methods.  > The only one of those four benchmarks the state is not meeting is the number of lab-confirmed cases, which continues to rise. The state recorded 691 new cases on Thursday, a single-day high.  > However, Cohen said the seven-day rolling average of cases continues to show leveling. With the increased number of tests being completed, she said, the number of cases are expected to rise.  Basically this kind of shoddy reporting penalizes states who are testing more, because of course when you test more you find... more cases!  Don't expect to see a difference from the policy change yet. Give it another week and pay attention to the number of deaths, which is a much better signal.
Misleading headline and bullshit article. The positive case rate hasn’t gone up. It is stable. We are just testing more. *This is good news not bad news. Despite moving to stage 1 of reopening the rate of spread does not appear to have increased.* And the article itself says as much.   Don’t believe headlines. Read. Think. Choose wisely.
Cases were increasing and we still went ahead to phase 1. I'm seeing fb posts from local stores I follow about opening up in the next few weeks.
well, now you know everyone's' going to want the bars open again tomorrow.
Here's my analysis, you can take it for what it is, but glancing at the chart, It looks like the rates spike up mid week, after being out during the weekend. It looks like it spikes, comes down, and kinda does it every week.
If other countries that have done a much better job of testing, lockdown, and prevention have seen a rise in cases after easing restrictions why would it be any different here?
Not true at all.  Go back and look at where we were at mid April when under 10 deaths a day.  We had 26 in today’s stats.  IHME site had us at 400 deaths by August then and now we are at 4000. This state is going backwards fast.  But no one seems to give a shit, just open her up. Amirite?  https://covidtracking.com/data/state/north-carolina    https://covid19.healthdata.org/united-states-of-america/north-carolina
Seems like mixed news to me!   Record number of cases is never good,  but percentages dropping is good.   I have no problems with this article...
That is a function of test processing capacity.  Lower capacity over the weekends means lower number of tests being processed and reported while a backlog builds up.  Full test processing capacity returns during the week and the backlog is cleared.
They also waited until things were much more stable and controlled before easing restrictions. The point isn't that there might be more cases, it's that we didn't reach the minimum recommendations of the CDC and WHO to begin reopening.
Deaths lag behind new cases by up to a month, they are not a good indicator of the current state of things.  With studies finding that median hospitalization ranges from 12-19 days (with deaths often being on the upper end of the spectrum), plus incubation period, plus time from onset of symptoms to hospitalization, we are likely seeing deaths of people infected in mid April.
I’m a solid advocate for keeping social distancing up as long as we can. And personally I believe we’re ending it too quickly in NC. But if you read the small print at IHME, the reason projections from NC changed dramatically since mid-April is that IHME updated the models they use to make those projections in early May, based on new data that more accurately reflected transmission and death rates.  Things haven’t actually gotten worse since mid May—they’ve stayed flat. Which was the whole point of the stay at home order.   From their own website:  “Why did the estimates for my location change?  On May 4, 2020, we made a major update to our model that led to a substantial increase in forecasted COVID-19 deaths in certain locations. In this model update, we factored in easing of social distancing, rising mobility, and increased testing. Also, our updated model better accounts for the observation that deaths in certain US states have been staying at a higher level for a longer period of time than seen in other countries that experienced earlier epidemics. Our initial May 4 update only covered the US. On May 12, we began using this updated model to project trends for all countries except Ecuador, which uses a different model.  Also, as the pandemic unfolds and we receive more data on COVID-19 deaths, our projections adjust to follow new trends that emerge. The largest changes tend to be seen in locations with little data, which are in the early phases of the pandemic. We have also revised our methods to better incorporate data from locations where estimates of deaths fluctuate substantially from day to day, which we believe to be the result of reporting practices instead of actual death patterns. We have also added data that some locations are reporting on presumptive COVID-19 deaths.”  Source: http://www.healthdata.org/covid/faqs#Deaths
Except it's not a record because there's actual an increase in infection rate, it's a record because more tests were conducted. It's like if you've spent the past week walking around in sunglasses and then today you took them off and went OMG THIS IS RECORD BRIGHTNESS
The only thing I’m an activist about is the proper use of data and statistics. This is not a political topic, but sadly both sides of our political spectrum have a bad habit of misinterpreting and misstating statistics. I’d wager you can’t even guess my political persuasion from my comments on this thread. I’m a scientist and a virologist and I’m passionate about making sure science isn’t distorted to serve political ends.
That's a great analysis, thank you!
I’m a rabid Trump hating Democrat. And I have a PhD in virology. And you don’t have a fucking clue.

J. Cole’s Dreamville Festival 2020 Canceled Due to COVID-19

Such a cursed festival.
They said it went great last year
Yep! It was great. But the first date was postponed and caused some slight annoyances.
It was fine, I wouldn’t say great IMO. plus the fact the food and restroom situation was a mess. There were like 2 hour long lines at the food trucks (roughly 10 of those) for a festival of 40,000. So many people I know + me went the entire 10 hours without eating a single thing. Checked Reddit after the festival and sooo many people had the exact same issue. Personally I think it was pretty disorganized, they could do a better job. That’s just one of the many issues there were. I could get really into it lol.
I’m kind of interested in hearing them.  I didn’t get to go last year and regretted it

North Carolina sees its worst day of new COVID-19 cases

Since 4/16 Wake County alone has gone from 552 (hospital confirmed cases) + 1 death to 1,168 + 28 deaths - Source: https://covid19.ncdhhs.gov/dashboard  Shits never been bad enough to overload hospitals, but it’s still pretty bad and shows were not ready to be opening back up.
Reopening should only be based on good data, nothing more.  That being said when testing is so low the data is incomplete, which is another problem.   We need more testing and only reopen when the data supports it.   A lack of a national plan is hindering the response and our safety net to support us is haphazard at best.  The armed protests need to stop. None of that is helping, they are strong arming the legislature into doing shit to please them.   All this virus did is show how fucked up this country is. Our healthcare is a joke, unemployment is a joke, people are broke, our government is corrupt, we bail out the rich while fucking the poor.  America is broken.
If this really started kicking off in Wake county in roughly mid March, that would mean there were 552 cases in the first month. That means there has been 616 cases in the month since. The total of 1168 doesn't count recovered people as that is a cumulative number and not an active number. If we assume a two week run time for the infection, that would mean somewhere around 300 people are infected right now. While I'm taking a wait and see approach to go out much, people who do choose to go out an partake in the very few incremental activities that are allowed now that weren't allowed a week ago aren't exactly taking crazy amounts of risk. Also keep in mind, the goal of restrictions was not to completely end the illness, it was to flatten the curve, which has happened.
Well, considering that we closed down to avoid overloading hospitals, what numbers would indicate to you that we are ready to open back up? Hospitalizations holding steady and percentage of positive tests going down even as mobility increases and retail reopens indicates to me that we're doing fine at this time, and Georgia hasn't seen a surge after reopening. I'm open to having my mind changed, though.
So the case doubling rate has increased to 30 days? That’s pretty damn good.
300 people infected that took the test. I bet there's tons that haven't taken the test and hundreds of asymptomatics
Mid-March (3/18) was when Wake County hospitals first began testing and reporting to the NCDHHS..  Also, In NC to the only way to count as a SARS CoVid19 infection is through a hospital provided test (either in hospital or at one of those tent setups)..  That said, you are correct the numbers are all weird and there were many MANY sick people (including myself) who got this virus back in January/February who are not being counted because there was no test.  For Wake County:  In March we had 17 confirmed cases (and 0 deaths). By 4/1 we had 195 confirmed cases (and 0 deaths).. By 5/1 we had a massive spike to 839 confirmed cases (and 18 deaths).. And as of 5pm today we’re sitting at 1175 confirmed cases (and 28 deaths) with no sign of slowing and no actual ‘flattening’ that I can see here.
Where exactly in NC are these cases decreasing? All data is showing steady and consistent growth throughout Wake County.  As for reopening, my clients here in the triangle are all still struggling but pushing for remote work through the rest of the summer because they all continue to have new employees each week testing positive even with this social distancing.  As for the whole ‘flatten the curve’ talk, Wake county hospitals have surprisingly never been overloaded or eve n appear to have been in desperate need of PPE.. (Seriously, check the. NCDHHS portal). But, the issue isn’t about overload or masks, it’s about the risk of continued cross infection especially to those who are older, sick already, or without insurance..   - Until the cases drop to much lower numbers those people will all remain at risk.
Number of cases != percentage of positive tests. I didn't say cases were decreasing, I said percentage of positive tests was.

NC churches win temporary restraining order against COVID-19 restrictions

I’d like to see the overlay of churches that teach the universe is 6000 years old & churches that are holding services today.  The guidelines for congregations of the ELCA in North Carolina are still in effect. I doubt I’ll be going to church until July at the earliest.  But we Lutherans aren’t distrustful of science either.
I thought God was everywhere all of the time. So can't you get brainwashed by the TV service for a couple of months.
Let's get our money source sick.  Thanks pastor!
Let them meet and infect one another
I’m grateful my church isn’t rushing back to in-person services. I miss seeing people, but I’ll take virtual services if it means we’re not possibly putting people in danger.
Good old constitution.
We Catholics learned to trust and work with scientists- now one is our Pope. It took atrocities and centuries, but finally...  I would hate to be the greeters at the door, tasked with the responsibility of turning away parishioners once the reduced capacity is reached.
It's hard for him to kill off his followers though if they are all isolating. He's bored. Hurricane season isn't here yet so this pandemic is all he has right now.
If only it were that easy. Those same people will be at the grocery stores infecting everyone else.
You should read the entire opinion, which is in the News & Observer story (link below), because the judge addresses that precise issue  (See pages 10-18).  Unfortunately, the excerpts in the WRAL story don't really do a good job of conveying the law behind this.     [https://www.newsobserver.com/news/coronavirus/article242788161.html](https://www.newsobserver.com/news/coronavirus/article242788161.html)   It's also important that the Governor isn't going to appeal the ruling.  Recall that Roy Cooper is the former state Attorney General -- he's litigated hundreds of cases on matters that were far less important.  He could easily ask the circuit court for a stay of this ruling,  The fact that he didn't means that he doesn't think he has a good chance.
Bush v. Gore
I mean you can have a church service in the church house even still social distancing. So I don’t know why y’all so mad that churches getting reopened.
True.

Raleigh cancels Fourth of July fireworks display over COVID-19

Dogs everywhere are rejoicing!
The cancellation of the fireworks is a budget decision. The city is facing a sizable loss of sales tax revenue.   https://cityofraleigh0drupal.blob.core.usgovcloudapi.net/drupal-prod/COR11/fy21-proposed-budget-message.pdf
Y'all, the reopen crowd is going to lose it over this.
Aw that’s too bad. It will be my first 4th of July since I moved to America and I was looking forward to it.
I’m fine with that. Not a big fan of fireworks anyway.
I rather be safe and sorry but i was looking forward to my first Fourth Of July here!
Money saver
Bummer!! I’ll be in Raleigh for the Fourth too!!
Now here's hoping my neighbors do...
Okay. Good.
Clearly they’re doing this because they hate freedom and are pro-virus
How are we going to celebrate 'Murica if we can't get drunk watch shit blow up?
good.
See y'all in SC.
“Muh freedom!”
Pyrotechnics added to the unemployment list, check!
Fireworks suck unless you are setting them off, then they rule. If you’re upset about a fireworks display getting cancelled you goddamn better be under the age of 7 years old. Only thing worse than people who enjoy firework displays are the ones who take pictures of fireworks.
I didn’t even know Raleigh had fireworks. Well upon second thought ig that isn’t surprising.
This is way too early to make that call...
Well ... that is really bad news.  We're talking over a month away.  Is the governor trying to keep this going all summer long!@??!
This is bad
And military vets
Babies...nevermind, parents of young babies are rejoicing over this news.
Ok that made me laugh.
And the atmosphere.
and people.
Not just because of the fireworks. Scientists are studying appears to be a couple cases where dogs may have contracted SARS-Cov-19
get thaat off of here.  This no place for facts.   I am pretty sure the county just did the property tax thing and its set for a few years? Is that correct?  if so thank you jesus! Cause if it is after thistwhole thing we all would be facing nice increase in the property tax rate to make up some shortfalls.
I hope they lose all of it
They can get that one asshole with the plastic rocket launcher to shoot bottle rockets out of it instead
They'll see this as a literally dissolving the Consitution.
WHAT YOU MEAN I CAN'T CELEBRATE THE BIRTH OF THE RED, WHITE, AND BLUE, YA DAMN COMMUNISTS
It's ready happening here.. Check the cross post to r/triangle lol
I cannot wait to see them go ape, and we can make fun of them.
And we care what they think why?
i like fireworks too but it's best to just wait till we can do one where everyone feels safe and we can really enjoy it.    welcome to america!  i hope we treat you well.
There will be plenty of fireworks still, you'll just have to drive further to see them.
The only worthwhile fireworks display I’ve seen as an adult was at Disney World. That shit was impressive. They have music/projections/a giant fuckin castle to help it out though.
Many will just use them at home illegally.
WE still can but the city won't pay for it.  Let's blow up a car and drink whiskey
It has been at the fairgrounds for a few years now, and was supposed to be as well this year.
> The fireworks display was slated to be held in the area of the PNC Arena and Carter-Finley Stadium.  Come on, literally the second sentence.
why does this have 12 downvotes lol it’s a pretty innocuous statement...
Probably not.  We may be coming up on a cancellation date in the contract for fireworks.
Me neither. I always go to Winston Salem that weekend for the fireworks at the Dash game
Somebody commented above and they may be correct - they may be coming up on a cancellation date in their contract that after which they don't get their money back/have to pay anyway. In that context it makes perfect sense.
it’s due to budget issues from revenue loss, not social distancing
The two headed yokels are still going to be blowing their appendages all to hell and whooping it up all across the county until the early morning in their fartbox import cars that backfire with every depression of the accelerator.
We pay 7.25% sales tax in the county...only 4.75% of that goes to the state, the rest is Wake County tax and that tax revenue has SERIOUSLY dried up.  Sure, property tax makes up a huge chunk of the budget, but it's not the only revenue source.
He didn't say it wasn't due to coronavirus?
From what i have seeen of them its way past that point. they clearly lost it a long time ago or never had it.
Every bit of it
There’s only one comment about it there, and it’s not even that unreasonable.
“We”   Well I’m glad our elected representatives finally decided to show up for once.
Thank you! You aight 🥰
or watch them on television/internet
I dunno, this one was pretty good :)   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndVhgq1yHdA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndVhgq1yHdA)
More trips to the ER then....whoops!
JOE, how did you get out of prison??
You can count me in
Ikr lol. I’m not even insulting Raleigh I just said I didn’t know they had fireworks. I’m kinda new to Reddit and I feel like users are easily triggered.
COVID-19 definitely is related, and none of us can say for certain they didn’t factor in any potential health risks, only that it wasn’t the sole determination for the cancellation. Even with health risks put aside it’s unlikely people would get out in the numbers needed to make the display profitable for the city and with a potential deficit they have to error on the side of caution.
The feeling is mutual.
My family left a communist regime to come to the USA. This is not communism. This is not depriving people of their rights. If anything, a stronger social net would be a boon to those of us who have been left out in the cold with no work and no benefits yet, business owners included.
I'd argue that someone saying this "isn't about the virus anymore" -> implying that the government is just doing this to be mean (?) is unreasonable
That was wild. I was expecting that Katy Perry vid where fireworks shoot out of her chest.
Very true. The reply that was made gave the tone that you "didn't read your own link" and said it was only because of budget and not in any way related to the coronavirus.
Lmao did you mean go?
Whatever.  Just wait.  Stay home like the government tells you.  They want you to stay home till the election? What has the government, sorry media told you what to think or to do today?   Wait till all the businesses are gone.  And all those people are fighting for your jobs.  Wait till products cost to much.    What is wrong with people gathering outside to watch a fireworks show going to cause?    Maybe we should just not have an election in November?   Too dangerous?     Reddit is full of sheep.  Follow the herd.  Stand in line for bread will become a new normal.    Maybe I’m being a bit dramatic.  Or just being a realist.    Proof on this Reddit post is how many people disagree with my opinion.  And I won’t back off.  Freedom is what Independence Day represents.
I wasn’t talking about that one, I was talking about the one that asked why people can’t watch from their cars. Doesn’t really matter, though.
Well since it's been posted above that is about the budget and not the virus their statement is correct.   here's the link:  [https://cityofraleigh0drupal.blob.core.usgovcloudapi.net/drupal-prod/COR11/fy21-proposed-budget-message.pdf](https://cityofraleigh0drupal.blob.core.usgovcloudapi.net/drupal-prod/COR11/fy21-proposed-budget-message.pdf)
works for me
Yes
It’s not primarily due to the health concerns, it’s due to the city being unable to pay for it, which is still caused by covid, but they can’t just decide to have it and let the people who feel comfortable be free to go. They literally can’t afford it.
People are down voting you because your hostility & me-ism. Thinking the majority of the world is brainwashed for having empathy. We don't want business to die, we just don't want people to possibly die more. That includes your parents and grandparents.
Right so this document states that as a result of lost revenue due to covid, we'll pass on the fireworks to save money. That is an equally unreasonable thing for an NC resident to be upset about.    Our government is balancing books and now people cry over some otherwise mediocre holiday entertainment?
I respect your honesty
That I can agree with.   This makes more sense.  This is just the beginning too.  When people are not out working and paying into the system.  We run out of money.    Which is basically my point.  How long do people think they should hide under their rock while the government hands them a check?  How long do they think the government can keep handing them a check?  How long before the government controls the people?   This was the whole idea behind our Independence Day.    Thank you for your comment under all the hate I receive here.  The down votes just show how bad Reddit really is.  They don’t agree.  They can simply downvote you.  No comment needed.
You know that the implication was though in both title of the post the article it linked which does mention the loss of revenue or balancing a budget.
If you don’t like the idea.  Then don’t go.  Stay under your rock while the rest of us live our lives.    It’s an outside event in an open area.  This is just dumb!!!
Eh. A downvote is whatever. I’d actually much rather a platform have a downvote or dislike option than not, because otherwise people’s only option to express their disagreement IS to comment, and the comments are often nasty vitriol instead of something worthwhile. If you don’t have something *productive* to say, might as well say nothing at all. Let it roll off ya back 😉
>reason
This doesn't look very compliant towards social distancing: [https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/3676486\_062918-cc-july-4-celebrations-img.jpg?w=800&r=16%3A9](https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/3676486_062918-cc-july-4-celebrations-img.jpg?w=800&r=16%3A9)     Second, the lack of fireworks was I thought due to loss in sales.
Thanks.  I am not on Reddit for a popularity contest. I am the kid in school that sits at the lunch table by himself.    The downvotes come from thin narrow minded people.  Which is hilarious because they are usually “liberal”.  These same people are out in the streets in mass crowds.   I guess the social Media platform wasn’t good enough anymore.
within reason. phrase. If you say that you will do anything within reason, you mean that you will do anything that is fair or reasonable and not too extreme. I will take any job that comes along, within reason.
That’s not Raleigh.  It can still be done in a safe manner in many places.    You mean a loss in tax revenue.  From employee people and small businesses.
I am a liberal and I disagree with what you were saying before, but can have a discussion with you. People on both sides of the line can be nasty at times. Your experience is that those are typically liberal folks because that is who disagrees with you. My experience is that conservative folks have commented on my opinions and viewpoints fairly often with calling me names like “stupid snowflake bitch”. Not sure what that accomplishes but there we are.  People are out in masses now to protest the killing of black americans by excessive force from police officers. They are assessing the risk and feeling that this is bigger than that, AND they are encouraging folks to wear masks and to stay home if they are high risk. Many of the reopen protests or simply folks on the conservative end who have advocated for reopening have actively discouraged the need for masks, and encouraged the reopening of businesses like restaurants that are staffed by low-income folks who disproportionately lack health insurance or the means to choose staying home over the option to work, putting them at risk against their will. Pretty big difference, wouldn’t you say?
[It was, but even if it wasn't here's another set of pictures.](https://raleighskyline.com/content/2014/07/05/city-watching-on-july-4th-and-fireworks-in-raleigh/)     And sorry, yes I meant a loss in tax revenue.  I woke up a bit ago, but have neglected my morning caffeine.
I agree.  And I agree with protesting.  I don’t agree with the riots.    Both sides can be nasty.  I agree with that as well.    Maybe that’s why we are having a conversation.  I have quite a few liberal friends.  I have more liberal views than many think.    We will never evolve if we keeping spitting in each other’s faces.    Thanks for reaching out. 😊

﻿570 employees at Tyson Plant in Wilkesboro test positive for COVID-19, the company says

We’ve been supporting the episcopal farmworker ministry that is helping the farm & plant workers who are being impacted by the virus.   They were essential workers who worked hard to put food on our table, risking their lives to do so. We couldn’t find any other organization doing the same in NC, it seemed the right thing to do that would do a little bit of good to help them in return.
It’s hard to imagine that people out and about in the community don’t have it, considering this. That’s a lot of vectors right there.
570... man that's pretty much criminal action that they had so little protections in place to have so many infected in one place
1/4 of the plant.  Phew!  Betcha the low income housing in the community are hot spots.
And not a single death. Hope they can get well and back to work ASAP.
Actually, at least one person associated with that Tyson location has died (so far).   https://www.journalpatriot.com/covid-19/death-of-man-who-worked-for-tyson-in-wilkesboro-tied-to-covid-19/article_73f695d4-94b4-11ea-982b-33812130fc92.html
He didn't work there. So my point stands.
“An employee of the Tyson Foods Inc. chicken processing complex in Wilkesboro who lived in High Point died from COVID-19 on April 30”. It’s also the title of the article.
Case closed. Open it all up. Burn all the masks. Full steam ahead.
But he didn't even get it from someone at the plant? So it's even less relevant. Good job.
Please tell me where you read that he didn’t get it at the plant? Would it matter if he didn’t? He was an employee there, there’s a highly contagious virus that kills some people and they all had to work in close proximity to one another without adequate PPE.   What is your point either way?
My point is that this whole thing is completely overblown. 570 people got it, the plant shut down, and one person died? Of this unprecedented pandemic? Jesus Christ it's basically just the flu but without a vaccine. We need to go back to living our lives without fear.
Weird it looks like you’re making the point that you don’t read and will lie and move goal posts to push your agenda.
They temporarily shut down the plant for cleaning... is that so unreasonable?
How many guns do you own?
Did you ever consider that this person can't read? Reading isn't a big deal when you can just watch fox news and listen to Alex Jones.
Weird it looks like you're going through my comment history and throwing shade at all of my previous comments because I hurt your feelings.
Weird you think someone interested in the reopening of North Carolina wouldn’t be interested in the city he lives in within North Carolina.

North Carolina Reports Highest One Day Spike Of COVID-19 Cases

You wouldn't know it from driving around or going to most stores.
I keep seeing people dismiss this fact by either claiming we need to look at the "percentage" or that "we are testing more", but over the past week we have seen the % of daily positive tests rise from 6% to 10%. Wouldn't we hope that since there are more tests being performed that the % would decrease, signaling that its not as widespread? Now we are seeing a huge influx of cases + the removal of our distancing safeguards. Doesn't this indicate that things are going to get real bad, real quick.
We should expect a bump. Considering we are opening up without any clue where the virus is
I’m not sure how quick you would get it but if they just opened Friday to be positive by Sunday? Thats a quick turnaround
This is expected and there isn’t anything to panic about at the moment. Keep following the CDC guidelines.
https://coronavirus.1point3acres.com/en  Click on NC  The day to day numbers are suspect this whole past week. 535 new cases to 31 to 1023 to 250. I really don’t trust that there was a “spike”. Maybe a batch of positive tests that came through at once?
Look at the data this report came from (follow the link in the article):  81% of those cases (reported) were people younger than 65.  85% of the deaths (reported) were people older than 65.  Most people have little to worry about, unless they have underlying health conditions--and they should be taking active steps to minimize exposure.
The Testing Positivity Rate needs to go down to signal a decline.
Yes it does, this is pretty bad news
You hope that the case fatality rate drops as more testing is performed. The goal isn’t to not get the virus, it’s to keep people from dying from it.  This is where trenching population comes into play.
The NC DHHS site lets you group cases by date sample collected. The last large spike looks to be on 5/18 but that could always just be coincidence.   https://covid19.ncdhhs.gov/dashboard/cases
It doesn't seem like they know or they're not publishing that information, but I don't know what the reporting requirements are for positive cases. I don't see a reason why they couldn't be grouping the numbers by test date, though if they were I'd expect that information to be more prominent.  I'd assume most were taken before the new reopening phase by a few days, but that just gives me more cause for concern about reopening.  edit: OP came through and [found what I could not](https://reddit.com/r/raleigh/comments/gpfz0w/north_carolina_reports_highest_one_day_spike_of/frlqvwi/)
That's not what's trying to be shown. It's saying that we were not ready for phase 2.
Which ones? The CDC said not to move from phase 1 to phase 2 if your state is seeing an increase in new daily cases. NC is and has been every since May 8th when we began phase 1. Phase 2 should have never started based on CDC guidelines.
It's expected because we are expanding testing. However, it's not 'that' expected in relation to the increased hospitalizations and the state dashboard stopped reporting daily deaths.   Especially in light of not meeting the metrics for 're-opening', its a bit concerning to say the least, and worth watching, as Mandy Cohen even said.   Minimizing it doesn't make it suddenly 'go away'.
> This is expected and there isn’t anything to panic about at the moment. Keep following the CDC guidelines.  I'm saving this for later
All this tells me is that younger people are being reckless. Thankfully it's been shown that this virus is difficult to transmit and the elderly wouldn't be likely to catch it from family members... right?
So you're saying that only those with risk factors should be social distancing, wearing masks, etc.?
It’s really just that.   There is nothing wrong with being concerned and cautious.  If your health is compromised.  You should stay locked down.  As matter of fact,  if I’m fact you are.  And can prove it. The state should be helping these folks.  Anyone else that is capable of getting back to work.  Let them.    This isn’t a one size fits all issue.  Having younger healthy adults sit at home isn’t going to work in the long run.    We can’t have everyone hide under a rock till there is a cure.
There have been multiple threads posted in the last day alone that show how careless/reckless people are being.   Everywhere I go people aren't wearing masks or social distancing. I do think that, if things were safe to re-open, that a larger amount of tests would show a lower percentage, because that would indicate that the majority of people were responsibly distancing and isolating.
>trenching population  What does this mean? I googled it but only returned links for excavating earth.
Ah okay, that makes a lot of sense then. Thanks for clearing it up
Most of the bad data is rising slowly.   This is not good news.  OTOH testing is also rising which is good news.   I really wish I could get tested since I have to travel for work and would rather not get anyone sick if I can avoid it.
Key phrase is "at the moment." There is no point in creating hysteria right now - anyone with an iota of intelligence could have predicted that opening up more industries would create a spike in cases.  We have to see how this plays out and continue to monitor.
I think most people aren't being reckless any more than usual; except  maybe on the Beltline.
I'm saying they're the ones who should stay home.
There may never be a cure OR a vaccine.  We aren't going to achieve herd immunity if nobody gets it, either.  The issue with these stories is the idea that the infections "SPIKED".  No, the *number of identified infections* is what spiked.  The number of deaths has actually trended down.  The number of hospitalizations has remained fairly stable.  >Having younger healthy adults sit at home isn’t going to work in the long run.  Except for the ones doing 90 mph on the Beltline, I've enjoyed having so many stay home from work.
I can only imagine that between bar-hopping and church services, weekends will only worsen the infection rate
People getting the virus isn’t necessarily bad. People dying from it is. So you allow healthy people under 40 to get it and keep vulnerable people isolated.
But this spike is before opening anything. It will be a little less than 2 weeks before we see the effects of opening.
9/11 killed over 3000 people. We are approaching 100,000. You are simply not comprehending the scale. Have some perspective. It is not hysteria. Open your eyes.
What if they can't afford to stay home? Don't have access to affordable delivery services, have to care for relatives, have to go to the ER?  The best thing for everyone to do is maintain social distancing and wear masks. No if, and or buts. Everyone should be wearing masks and keeping a distance when possible.
You mean like the Security of Health and Human Services:     >In a statement Saturday, the state's Department of Health and Human Services reported 1,107 infections – around 250 more cases than the state's last highest daily tally.   >   >"This is a notable and concerning increase," said the department's secretary, Mandy Cohen.
It is impossible to infer anything meaningful from the data since everyone can not get tested and testing is still ramping up. There is no need to overreact. We flattened the curve in NC based on our **current** rate of testing, and that is why more industries were allowed to open up.  Cases will continue to have spikes as long as testing is increasing and especially now that more things are opening. We need to continue to monitor with poise but not freak out for every spike.
Do not misunderstand me, I understand the scale of the deaths and I am not pitching for opening everything back up. I am simply stating the fact that we have flattened the curve in NC based on our current rate of testing, and as such, we are allowing more industries to open. We will continue to see spikes as things open and as testing becomes more widespread but creating mass hysteria just for the sake of hysteria is not helping anybody.  This is an evolving situation.
>What if they can't afford to stay home? Don't have access to affordable delivery services, have to care for relatives, have to go to the ER?  Then they need to choose what's best for them.  >Everyone should be wearing masks and keeping a distance when possible.  Do you accept that there's risk to going to any health facility, or the grocery store?  It's the same argument.
I'd agree if people actually took this seriously. The average American and average NC resident is not reacting.
> Do you accept that there's risk to going to any health facility, or the grocery store? It's the same argument.  Yes, there's risk going anywhere. But that's why we should but down that risk collectively, *for everyone*, by wearing masks and social-distancing when possible.  ETA: I'm not arguing we should keep everything closed for months on end. That's impractical and short-sighted. But limiting a building's capacity and cutting down on crowds are economically feasible and safe. More than anything, though, MASKS. I cannot for the life of me understand why people have decided it's okay to risk *other people's lives* by not wearing masks.
And no one is going to argue against that, except maybe the mask part when outdoors.  You certainly wouldn't see me reaching past another person at the grocery store.  But on this sub, you have people arguing against others choice to work, go to church, go to a restaurant, or any number of activities that can be accomplished using the same/similar precautionary measures.  The extremes are just that, and very vocal.
See for me, when I see people arguing that "most of us have little to worry about" and "we have to choose what's best for ourselves", that quickly veers into a "fuck you got mine" attitude that justifies going to packed bars and not wearing masks.
The flip side of that is, "screw your job/livelihood, I need to go to the grocery store" or "People will DIE, if you go to church".  There is no one (long term) answer that can cover everyone's needs.  A cure or a vaccine won't be available for many months, if it ever does.  With proper precautions, people can work, go to church, etc.  Locking down has never been about eliminating the spread, only slowing it.  It's becoming pretty clear the impact of the virus has not turned into the "millions dead" scenario that some predicted, and we know what an economic depression can do.  I can't speak to the bar crowd, except to say that I didn't go there, nor would I choose to.  I can't honestly say my recent visit to the grocery store or Lowe's was any less of a risk.  Who knows if that card reader with the plastic over it was safe.  They don't spray it down or change the plastic with every new customer.
> It's becoming pretty clear the impact of the virus has not turned into the "millions dead" scenario that some predicted, and we know what an economic depression can do.  It hasn't turned into this because we've shut down society temporarily to get a handle on the virus before it overwhelmed the healthcare system (the way it did in other countries) and took the time to develop ways to reopen the economy while avoiding more surges. And I honestly agree with everything else you're saying, but you've pitched it in a way that a lot of people are finding tone-deaf. If we can't tell whether you're advocating "reopen without caution, healthy people don't need to worry" or "reopen slowly and make sure we stay apart and wear masks whenever possible", then I don't think you're getting your real point across well.
> It hasn't turned into this because we've shut down society temporarily.......I don't think you're getting your real point across well.  Right now, we're trying to open things back up, to minimize/reverse the economic impacts of the shut down which could be far worse than the impacts of the virus.  >to get a handle on the virus before it overwhelmed the healthcare system  And we've largely accomplished this.  As I type this, the number of hospitalizations is 589.  This number has been fairly consistent for the last several weeks, and is nowhere near the limits of our (NC) healthcare facilities.  And the fact that we've identified more infections lately (the "spike") without the need for additional hospitalizations would seem to indicate the consequence of infection is less severe to the majority of the public.  Clearly, if hundreds start dropping dead in the coming week or two, the spike means something.  Although, I can't find out if those "positive" tests are positive for the virus or for antibodies, which would mean different stages of infection.

Online questionnaire on the impact of covid-19 worldwide
Hello, mod approved post. I am a researcher at the University of Edinburgh in collaboration with NHS Scotland. We are conducting an online questionnaire on the effects of covid-19 virus, lockdown and social distancing.This can be completed by anyone over 18 worldwide. We currently have a large sample from the US however very few from North Carolina.Please follow the link below and let us know how you have been impacted.Also a chance to win £100 in the prize draw!https://edinburgh.onlinesurveys.ac.uk/covid-19_studyThank you!!! (Feel free to share)The findings of our study will be shared in the group when finalized.For more information please contact me at kelsea.stewart@ed.ac.uk
Hope it helps! Just filled it out! Hoping for that £100 and will spend the next 4 weeks figuring out the conversion 😂 good luck!
Thank ya for the research, interested to see the results

Sheetz on Aviation Pkwy - Parking lot is currently blocked off. I assume it is COVID-19 related but does anyone know for sure?
Parking lot entrances are blocked and pump stations are all taped off as well. Haven't been able to find any News sources on why yet.....
It’s a positive COVID for an employee it was just on WRAL.
Not sure, but I wouldn't immediately assume Covid related.  There's a lot of construction going on over there and also lots of rain yesterday.  So, maybe a busted pipe or just general flooding could be a reason as well.  There could be lots of reasons.
Maybe either that or they found a skimmer.
Very true. Hadn't thought of that.....
Unless it is........and this is 🤷‍♀️
True. I really am old enough that I should know better than to assume (because we all know what happens when you "assume")  Even though it turned out to be correct in this case, it could have been for a large number of reasons completely unrelated to COVID-19.

Media coalition sues Cooper, cabinet agencies for COVID-19 records

Here’s a link to a similar article:  https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.wbtv.com/2020/05/28/media-coalition-sues-cooper-cabinet-agencies-covid-records/%3foutputType=amp  It sounds like the agencies are just taking their merry time with work. Cooper’s quotes make it sound like he’s taking strong action, but I doubt it considering how far this has come. Just as how the unemployment agency’s head recently stepped down, I think something similar will have to be done if Cooper wants to escape the blame of being ineffective.
Well written and detailed article.

Protesting and Covid 19?

Of course you just exposed yourself to lots of people
Your odds are considerably higher, but if you're worried, try to get tested.
Are you being serious?
Lol
\[not an expert opinion\] Being in a big crowd is going to raise your risk by some amount, but it sounds like you took decent precautions. You're probably fine.
True, I’m just wondering how great of a risk considering the precautions.
Look I know it’s a higher risk. I’m just wondering considering I stayed away from people and wore a mask. It was also outside which is much more difficult place for it to spread
Yeah I feel like that too. It’s unfortunate all of this is happening at a time like this 😢 I absolutely didn’t forget about the virus while protesting and for the most part it looked like most people didn’t either
Bunches of yelling with likely at least a lil spit flying in your direction or even a sneeze is all it takes.
No one was yelling near me but that’s definitely true!

Avoid Oakwood Cemetery area. Armed Protestors are converging ARTICLE: Police encounter coronavirus protesters at Raleigh cemetery

what a bunch of fucking dorks
What?  Why?  I have so many questions.  One of them being why are they protesting a cemetery?
Police handled that pretty well
Why would a “PEACEFUL” protest need that amount of  Ammunition?
Dipshits
In North Carolina, you cannot bear arms while protesting.  The irony is if they were persons of color, they’d probably have been shot by the police.
These people are stupid.
Are donning the weapons necessary? Realistically, these people are actually going to put up a fight if it would get to that point? Forget the camo and vests, someone needs to get them some white makeup and a blue wig with a red nose because they’re a bunch of fucking clowns. Also the people who have their face covered are the biggest chicken shit out of all of them. If your going to go all out at least have the decency to show your face.
These goobers always look the same. ALWAYS.   There's also always some dipsit wearing an american flag tank top too.
These are the types that should get the virus. There’s no need for guns right now. Idiots go play with you’re toys together at Home
People are not handling boredom well
Is there any interest among any former combat arms types to go troll the shit out of these dumb fucks on the inevitable next go round?  Still have a plate carrier laying around from the last contracting gig. Was think of slinging some type of high speed super soaker or nerf gun, putting on a clown wig, and making some kind of “I’m with stupid” placard.   Just brainstorming.
I can’t even.... wow.
I don't understand: why haven't they been arrested yet?  They're breaking the law.
Well, thank goodness they are so well-armed.  The zombies of the civil war veterans have been massing in that cemetery for week.  About time some armed citizens took them on.
Did they stop or put the weapons away or were they allowed to continue?

We kill time (me and my two little kids) in the line at Krispy Kreme, and there were HELLA cop/sheriff/trooper cars around the capitol and guvs mansion at 10 am.
Bunch of badasses right there.... 😒
Is that one dude holding a Mountain Dew? Is that part of the uniform?
Openly carrying guns in public, especially this type, is in itself an act of violence to me.
Wow holy shit I was just here yesterday getting some photos. Good thing I got there before these dumbasses showed up.
What I really dislike here is the Mountain Dew drinker trying to antagonize the local police by saying the state/city laws are "worthless paper" while keeping his trigger finger a little closer to ready than it should be.  Federal law isn't the supreme mandate. When you step into a state, county, and city, you are also subject to the laws set within those boundaries.

You don't just spend all that money on a fancy AR and the whole outfit to wear it at home. They're just strutting their stuff around downtown LARPing like they matter.

"The crowd disbursed at 2 o'clock" Thats drinkin' time!
I just looked at the apartment across the street from where they are. Its not a bad place but I am second guessing applying. Gunna steer clear if that is where these guys hangout.
Probably the most ironic thing about this: These people aren't wearing masks to prevent the spread of Covid-19. They're wearing masks because they don't want to be identified. Really brave.
When being an incel goes too far.
A more productive protest would have been 1000 people, each spaced ten feet apart, and wearing face coverings, to demonstrate that we are ready for at least one of the core state preparedness responsibilities set out.
No one should take these poors seriously. Wake me up when people show up with nods and Crye JPCs.
What I really dislike here is the Mountain Dew drinker trying to antagonize the local police by saying the state/city laws are "worthless paper" while keeping his trigger finger a little closer to ready than it should be.  Federal law isn't the supreme mandate. When you step into a state, county, and city, you are also subject to the laws set within those boundaries.
You don't just spend all that money on a fancy AR and the whole outfit to wear it at home. They're just strutting their stuff around downtown LARPing like they matter.
If shit goes south, i'm with the guy with all of the bags:   * first aid kit(iodine, bandages, vitamin pills);  * one miniature bible  * canteen/cup/condiments  * tin of bread rations  * maps/notebook/writing utensils  * soap dish/shaving kit/handkerchief/foot powder  * magnifying glass/flashlight/compass/flint  * one Bernie Sanders flag & microbrewery growler(to help blend in with locals in case trapped in enemy territory)
Mehhh
Well handled by both the citizens exercising their rights and the Raleigh police.
They said in a live video that this is the resting place of the confederate dead. And dead confederates can't protect themselves. Edit: the second sentence was suppose to be /s. Apologies for those who thought it was part of their statement.
Very well... Thank you NC police!
Because people with crippling insecurities, delusional self-entitlement and precarious grievances with constitutional law can (apparently) only be remedied by carrying assault weapons in a Raleigh neighborhood.
They're gonna shoot the virus.
These type of people will use ANY opportunity to LARP in their tacticool operator gear. That is all this is.
they want to intimidate people because they are terrorists.
Not actually clear from the video how much, if any ammo they have, not uncommon for 2A protestors to have empty mags
I'm not super fresh on the laws, but I thought the no carrying during protests thing was regarding concealed carry? I could totally be wrong.
I think RPD would probably try to avoid a firefight with heavily armed individuals in a wealthy residential neighborhood, no matter what race they were
Technically you can't but very few people have ever been convicted of that. The last notable case was thrown out.
>The irony is if they were persons of color, they’d probably have been shot by the police.  No
Sad but true.
Very sad & very true ...
Hyperbole much? Or is this another "imaginary" injustice like the "kid" who was shot a few months ago for "carrying a pizza"?
donning
PT belts will be mandatory I assume?
What law are they breaking?
It's a little known fact, but that is what they we're considering calling the Minutemen back in the day. Unfortunately, some British wanker had already trademarked it.
It is certainly an act of intimidation.
Violence is the use of physical force so as to injure, abuse, damage, or destroy.       Things you conjure up in your head don't alter definitions.
I wouldn’t be too bothered, that’s a nice place to live, and the reason they were in the news is exactly because it’s unusual. I’m pretty sure those guys mostly hang out on Facebook.
but do you have toilet paper
Their right to be assholes
This, seriously. Any interaction with our government involves them having a gun within smelling distance, yet people get so butthurt when a citizen does the same.
Probably not the same people
That’s one of the stupidest things I’ve ever heard.
I'm not saying you're a liar necessarily, but that's so dumb I'm going to need a link to fully believe it.
lol what do dead people need to protect themselves from??
I vote that we make everyone truly equal and treat white protestors the same as black protestors ASAP.
> Because people with crippling insecurities  You can just say “teeny tiny penises.” We know what you mean.
Exactly. What are they protecting themselves from?   Ugh... so gross. Insecure people with deadly toys.   Fragile egos needing recognition because their fathers told them they couldn’t have feelings.
I mean, they have Halloween 🎃
Homegrown Terrorists
I saw a video in another N&O article in which one of them bends over to pick up a dropped magazine and round.
Valid point & makes me feel a little better... so, is it just a show and tell 🤷🏻‍♀️ “look at my cool toys”
NCGS 14-277.2  >	It shall be unlawful for any person participating in, affiliated with, or present as a spectator at any parade, funeral procession, picket line, or demonstration upon any private health care facility or upon any public place owned or under the control of the State or any of its political subdivisions to willfully or intentionally possess or have immediate access to any dangerous weapon. Violation of this subsection shall be a Class 1 misdemeanor. It shall be presumed that any rifle or gun carried on a rack in a pickup truck at a holiday parade or in a funeral procession does not violate the terms of this act.  Since the cemetery is a nonprofit and not a city entity, that may make the ordinance moot. But if they were on the sidewalk that is publicly maintained…  I do rather wish, though, that the police were as patient with unarmed persons color as they are with armed white people.
It applies to open and concealed carry, however I can’t really tell if Oakwood Cemetery is owned by the state/city or not, which would make the difference. Specifically under NCGS 14-277.2      I’m not even going to touch the rest of the straw man argument in the parent comment.      Edit: Oakwood Cemetery is privately held. If the statute is interpreted by its present language they are fine to carry weapons during their protest if they stay at the cemetery.
Doubled up. They make everything magically safe and stupid, so it seems appropriate.
North Carolina is an example of the latter: While the state allows open carry and preempts cities from making their own gun rules, it also has a law explicitly banning guns from demonstrations and one against “going armed to the terror of the people.” Those statutes, both misdemeanors, were recently used to prosecute two leftists who brought firearms to an anti-KKK march in Durham.  From  https://www.thetrace.org/2017/09/35-states-local-officials-cant-ban-guns-protests/
Protesting at the present time is against the law.
Exercising rights is not an act of intimidation.
The *threat* of force is also violence.
Yours too, apparently.
No doubt. I think some just get the vapors easily from things like this, but others feign it to push their agenda against individual rights.
It for sure is the same people.
Or maybe people should protest the fact that the Government isn’t following through in their promise to supply income to people after asking them to stay home. If people focused on the actual problems instead of getting geared up and screaming about needing a haircut something might actually get done.  A $1200 check is a joke when it comes to making up for lost income due to the stay-at-home orders and people should have gotten a larger amount than that. These groups agendas should be focused on asking for more streamlined UI and supplementing income, not being able to go to the beach.
Well there’s a lot of ghosts there
/r/technicallythetruth
Thing of their target demographic though. Is it that surprising?
Apologies. The first sentence was true and the second sentence was /s.
Necrophiliacs?
Inbred paranoiacs brandishing firearms, apparently
I vote we treat homegrown terrorist like terrorist.
They are treated equally.
In another video, one of them bends over to pick up a dropped magazine and round. They are carrying live ammunition.
My assumption is its either a nod to the ongoing political battles over the 2A in Virginia that has many in NC on edge OR its a desire for more publicity. 12 guys protesting downtown is barely newsworthy, 12 guys with guns protesting downtown is a different matter even more so since this is illegal in NC and hence more rare than our neighbors (you often see 2A protesters in NC protesting with empty holsters)  There's also a lot of hate right now to the Wake County Sheriff from gun owners in the county which could play a roll as  well.  But I am really just guessing
So the potential crime could be trespassing
Unless whoever runs the cemetery isn't ok with it.
I mean, technically, isn’t a cemetary a health care facility?
guys I'm sure these protesters have all been through a lot of combat training and are ready to overthrow the most powerful military in the world. I've watched war movies too but I don't think I can do what they do with little to no training.
NCGS 14-277.2 generally does prohibit the carrying of weapons open or concealed at a protest. The loophole is that it only applies to public places under control of the state or one of the states subsidiaries. Oakwood Cemetery is privately held, meaning that they are fine to do as they please if they stay at the cemetery.     Disclaimer: I still think they are acting like children.
They aren't going armed to the terror. There is nothing threatening about their actions. They're exercising their US and North Carolina Constitutional Rights. They peaceably engaged with the Raleigh police.     The Raleigh police let the one individual that was carrying a sign know that he couldn't carry the sign and be armed. When that part was explained, they specifically agreed to comply at the same time pointing out the ridiculousness, and told the police they wanted to be clear because they weren't there to make the police be the bad guys.
Protesting at the present time is not against the law.
So you don’t think somebody can intimidate with speech?
No... a threat is a threat, not violence. And they weren't making threats, either.
How so? Do explain ...  Note: You can not protest with firearms , so no - not their “right”
They should have proton packs instead of shotguns.
https://www.newsobserver.com/news/local/crime/article241087226.html  This is a video of a black protest with no guns on March 11th 2020.  Say that again with a straight face.
Shit.
Well said, thanks.
Some high schoolers kicked Russia’s ass in Red Dawn. This should be a walk in the park.
“Nothing threatening about their actions” - YOU HAVE TO BE FUCKING KIDDING RIGHT????
these men look like domestic terrorists. Imagine if they weren't white.
They are armed to intimidate. The first rule you learn in gun safety is not to show you have a weapon until you need to use it.
Do you need to carry an assault rifle to protest though? Hell no.
I thought it was deemed a "nonessential activity?"
Then that's more than exercising of rights.      No, the simple exercising of rights in of itself is not intimidation.
Is burning crosses a threat?
If you actually read the language of NCGS 14-277.2 they might actually be allowed to if that cemetery is privately owned. I can’t really tell if it is or not.      I still think they are acting like children.       Edit: Oakwood Cemetery is privately held. If the statute is interpreted by its present language they are fine to carry weapons during their protest.
You're exercising your rights. Just like these gentleman.      Yea, that was explained in the video that the two rights couldn't be exercised together. I don't know if the Founding Fathers would have agreed, but it's current law.
Just shows how little thinking was involved here
Ah, the good ole "pizza boy" protest. Didn't some of those protesters burn and destroy things? Compared to the much smaller, much more polite group of protesters yesterday? It is almost as if actions play a large role in the response you get.
Oh shit you're right. Forget what I said. Can't wait to see what kind of government they set up once they overthrow this tyrannical one.
I thought you were going to excercise your right to no longer engage in conversation with me, Bobo? Anyway, no need to shout.      threatening: indicating or suggesting the approach of possible trouble or danger.      Open carry is the law in North Carolina. These gentleman took no actions other than to exercise their US and North Carolina Constitutional rights. Exercising your rights does not suggest possible trouble or danger.
How many people were shot yesterday? I saw one shooting in Durham, but none in Oakwood. Strange.
Most mass gunmen are straight white men who can’t get laid.
They are not armed to intimidate. They are exercising their rights.      That is not the first rule you learn in gun safety. The first rule is don't point your weapon at anything you don't intend to destroy. Your rule  is a conceal carry rule. You need to be licensed in order to conceal carry. Open carry is allowed in NC. Open carry does not require a license.
They weren't protesting, they were exercising their US and North Carolina right to bear arms Constitutional rights. The police made it clear they could protest or they could exercise their right to bear arms rights, but not both. The agreed to comply and said they weren't here to make the police the bad guys.
The Governor issued a clarification that protests were not illegal, but social distancing was required. They issued that clarification because reopenNC was getting ready to take legal action.
I don’t think you have a good grasp on the topic you are discussing.
Are they burning crosses, captain strawman?
Interesting ... wonder if the owner is part of their organization/ group?   Thanks for sharing.
🙄 Aren’t you the same “gentleman” that compared having feelings to dogs licking plates?   I’ll extra my right to no longer engage in conversation with you. Thanks
Protestors on Tuesday were armed and destroyed parts of the governors mansion.
Pretty sure almost every major mass shooting in the United States recently has been a white man with an assault rifle from Sandyhook to Las Vegas if you want to start comparing things.
What’s the point of full camo?
Is this what economic anxiety looks like?
If that makes you happy.
The point is: can speech be deemed violent? Is simply burning a cross a violent act?  It’s a yes or no question.
No idea what you're babbling about dogs licking plates, but thank you as well for discontinuing.
And those protesters were justifiably arrested. None of the pizza boy protesters were arrested, which seems to suggest that the largely black protest group was treated *better than* their white counterparts.
They are carrying weapons. We are an open carry state. If you don't like Constitutional Rights, there is a process defined in the Constitution by which you can amend or remove those protections.       I'm not grasping at anything. You're the one displaying that characteristic of desperation with your insults, strawman arguments, and self righteous pontificating.      The rights in question apply to lessons learned from all of human history. Our Founding Fathers applied these lessons to create a nation that recognizes and protects the rights of the individual. Human nature hasn't changed in the subsequent 250 to 300 years. Absolute power still corrupts absolutely. The ability to speak out against such power and defend ourselves from it with force if necessary are our rights and protected by the founding document of our nation. I know that's right.
Uh yeah there have been numerous studies about the demographic representation of mass shooters. The only group that is overrepresented for some reason besides males is Asians. White males are actually underrepresented as mass shooters when the demographic makeup of society is factored in-  https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2017/oct/06/newsweek/are-white-males-responsible-more-mass-shootings-an/
Camo is intimidating?
I'd say current economic anxiety along with government authoritarian measures don't help.
I've already said no... a threat is a threat, not violence. And they weren't making threats, either.      Exercising rights is not in of itself in any way, shape, or form an act of violence or threat of violence.
https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.cnn.com/cnn/2020/03/11/us/raleigh-police-shooting-protests/index.html  There was at least one arrest. I get that you want to feel right here, but maybe fuck off. I'm done replying.
What’s the point of it?
Ah yes, Trump is sure making life hard out there for white gun owners.
You should look up the difference between *assault* and *battery*.
Ok, so they were treated equally. Which makes your original point wrong. Glad to see you bowing out.
I don't know. Next time my neighbor goes for a walk in her camo yoga pants, I'll ask her.
You sure are race obsessed, I'll give you that. I just don't feel like diving down your strawman rabbit hole at the moment, so I'm going to leave you alone to your mental masturbations.
Again... exercising rights is not in of itself in any way, shape, or form an act of violence or threat of violence.
Please show me all of your examples of Pro Trump people of color opening carrying or wanting to express their right to carry like this?
maybe we shouldn't have the right to walk down Fayetville street with an assault rifle.
Strawman, strawman... straw, straw!      Oh... right there baby... yea, that's it. Faster, faster....     You're almost there.
Maybe we should have the right.       Should or shouldn't regarding Fayetville St. aside, exercising rights is neither an act of nor threat of violence.
Oh you’re like the “be the middle” guy. Fun.
how is walking down fatetville street with your finger on the trigger of an AR-15 and full camo not a threat of violence? are you really that far down the rabbit hole lol
Did someone do that?
maybe look at the pictures that the N&O published today.   or yeah, I guess you could keep pontificating about "muh rights" or whatever.
I'm trying to figure out what crime you see here. There were no threats made. I've seen no fingers on the trigger as you have claimed. Do you have a problem with people exercising their US and North Carolina Constitutionally protected rights?
Mr. Strawman here reporting for duty.
Report away, man. No idea what you're babbling about.       I've addressed issues specific to this thread, no more, no less.
no one said anything about a crime.... that's why I called you Mr. Strawman.    Most people just think someone walking down a street in Raleigh with camo clothing and an AR is frightening. But I guess that's "your constituional right" or whatever.  Damn liberals, right?
Lol... really? In this thread, of which you've been a part, there have been claims or references to threatening violence, assault, and battery. These are all crimes. So yea, people, including yourself, have alleged crimes.      Some people finding something frightening doesn't make it immoral, illegal, or wrong. Constitutional Rights aren't governed by other people's emotions.
How many mass shootings a year involve an assault rifle? But yeah keep going with your wet dream about "constistuonal and state rights" and " a good guy with a gun"
You're rambling incoherently. I'm going to go to bed.
Nothing about my argument has been incoherent. The fact that my opinions "are frightening"  don't change the fact that expressing them is my constitutional right!   Am I doing this right?   whenever someone starts to point out how ridiculous your rhetoric is, your only defense is to act like they're not making any sense. you should maybe stop doing that.
Everything about your argument has been incoherent. You say something. You end up being wrong. You say something different. You're wrong again. You're throwing shit against the wall in the hopes something will stick.      No, you're not doing anything right.      I don't have a rhetoric. I believe in the principles that our country were founded upon to include individual rights. If you don't like that, so be it.    If you have any additional ramblings, I'll answer them in the morning. Good night.
"principles that our country was founded on"    "constituonal and state protected rights"  "It is the exercise of power under the rule of law, not the momentary opinion of the electorate"   These all sound like Nicholas Cage outtakes in National Treasure
Glad to see you took rambling incoherently to heart.

Coronavirus cases by zip code (map)

2%^ You forgot to move the decimal.
Helps to have some of the best medical infrastructure in the world in one metro area.
And we've only kept it there because we didn't overwhelm the hospitals.
420 / 11,509 = .0365  .0365 * 100 = 3.65% -- about 183 times higher than 0.02%

Wake County has 4th coronavirus outbreak with multiple cases at Apex nursing home

Counter protesting.   The nurses who are in the news are counter protesting the pro-covid protesters.

Plastic bag recycling during coronavirus, preferably outside drop-off?
Is anyone aware of places still accepting plastic bags/film for recycling? Would prefer somewhere I can get to at night and outside to reduce risk of COVID-19 exposure. Plastic bags are not accepted at convenience centers. Edit: I didn't mean like curbside drop off where someone comes and gets it from you, I just meant a bin outside I could walk up to. Food Lion on Lake Boone Trail wins!
Yeah, pretty much all HT's and Food Lions have them in my experience.
My local Harris Teeter has a collection spot outside of the front doors.  It seems too large to move at night, though I've never been there at night to see if it's "open."
Food Lion has them too, not only for plastic shopping bags but also film (like bread bags).
Yes HT & FL all have drop offs. Even Target. Dropped ours off today actually at the FL off of Avent Ferry.
Target is currently not accepting recylables. Food Lion takes plastic and film, paper, glass and plastic bottles. HT and Lowes Foods take paper and plastic. Publix takes egg cartons, paper, and plastic. Wegmans just paper and cans.
I took it to the food lion on Lake Boone Trail. Just what I was looking for...easily accessible at night and outside. Easy to open and spacious bin (unlike the old Kroger on Six Forks recycling). Thanks to all who responded!
Which location?
Literally each and every food lion and harris teeter that I've visited in Raleigh.   Right beside the main entrance (~10 feet from the door).
The one in Morrisville definitely has it.
The one in Clayton, though I assume others would have it as well.

WakeMed vs UNC Coronavirus (Antibody Testing)
I just wanted to share a very strange dynamic that I've experienced with WakeMed and UNC here in Raleigh.WakeMed provided antibody testing to two members of my household. The tests were conducted by LabCorp - one came back positive and one came back negative. 🤔Given the results, WakeMed is requesting that the positive test recipient consent to releasing her data and thus be counted as positive COVID-19.So, I decided to get my own test from UNC given that my ex-wife, with whom I share custody, tested positive for coronavirus and now one member of the household is confirmed to have antibodies.Here's the rub...UNC absolutely refuses to order the test on the premise that the antibody test only confirms the presence of a coronavirus antibody (not COVID-19), which is apparently quite common. Yet UNC will provide the test to those donating plasma, which I don't get because if the test is really meaningless, what good would plasma from a positive test result be?So my question is how can one provider assert that a positive antibody test confirms that the subject had full blown COVID-19 while the other claims that the test essentially means nothing?Is WakeMed pushing a test that literally means nothing to make up numbers? Or, is UNC crying over spilt milk because they don't actually have the tests in-hand? How can these providers be so far apart on this?
If I'm understanding this correctly,  this is disturbing. Are you saying that WaMed is reporting possibly inaccurate positive tests for caronavirus antibodies? Isn't the state using these numbers as part of determining when to move to the next phase of reopening?
There are different antibody tests with varying levels of accuracy. Maybe UNC doesn’t find the Wakemed version of the test to be accurate enough to warrant justification for testing you.
Has anyone signed up for the $10 (upfront fee then insurance bill ) Labcorp antibody test at one of their centers yet?
The tests are conducted by LabCorp. Both UNC and WakeMed use LabCorp. So it's the same test.
Good question. Apparently, they request a release of the data per HIPPA regulations. The release disclaimer specifically states that the data will be reported to HHS and will increase the number of infected by one. It also states that this may subject the patient to contact tracing. However, it does NOT state that the testing facility will report it as a positive case. So it could easily mean that HHS or NCDHHS will make the determination regarding how the data is interpreted and reported. Good catch.
Ok, that's not as bad as i was thinking. I don't think they should be using positive antibody tests in those numbers.
So, it seems that this is another topic of debate and the answer isn't as simple as it would seem on the surface. For, example, in VA. and PA, it seems that a positive antibody test is captured as a "probable case", thus creating a clear delineation between a "confirmed case" and a "probable case". HOWEVER, the DOH websites in PA and VA lump confirmed and probable cases into their case counts on their websites, tracker, etc.. I haven't come across any anecdotal reports on how NC handles this but I do think it important to recognize the distinction between how the data is captured/analyzed vs how it's reported. I'm assuming that the ambiguity regarding how the numbers are distributed to the public, media and other federal bodies is by design for political posturing. Some will make the numbers trend up, some might use it to trend numbers down. Hard to say.
I think that IS what OP is saying. Basically there’s no consistency in reporting.
Not necessarily, LabCorp could have produced multiple types of tests
So you're saying LabCorp developed one test for WakeMed and one for UNC,  got both of those approved by the FDA and conducts each test differently depending on who referred the patient?  Seems awfully inefficient but I guess there's a lot we don't see.  If that's the case, who's providing these free tests to the blood donors in Durham that the news keeps talking about?
More likely they were only able to get x amount of materials for test type a and y amount of materials for test type b. Maybe the two providers made agreements with labcorp two days apart, and labcorp contracted company 1 with test a, then ran out of available supply when it came time for the contract with company 2.    Ultimately, no one on reddit is going to have an answer for you beyond speculation.
No antibody tests have been FDA "approved" as of yet.  A very small amount of them have received "emergency use authorization" and even those aren't necessarily 100% accurate.  > There are no approved  available alternative tests .  FDA has issued EUAs for other antibody tests that can be found at https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/mcm-legal-regulatory-and-policy-framework/emergency-use-authorization#2019-ncov  From https://www.fda.gov/media/137469/download
I'd assume they already had a generic coronavirus test from previous strains, and have recently developed a covid-19 specific. Its up to UNC and WakeMed which they choose to purchase or prescribe from their supplier.
Unfortunately, it seems you're right in that no one really seems to have an answer. My limited research shows that both UNC and WakeMed send blood samples to LabCorp who conducts the IgG test.  What's clear, is that UNC doesn't believe in the efficacy of the test because the likelihood is high the test will create a false positive based on the fact that the IgG test will pick up antibodies from previous exposure to coronaviruses other than SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19).  WakeMed clearly advocates that the IgG test is accurate to the point that they will report a positive test result as a new COVID-19 case (thus inflating NC's number of cases).    Both of these positions align with LabCorps documentation on the test. So, it seems the real debate comes down to the likelihood that someone who tests positive for antibodies has been exposed to a coronavirus other that COVID-19. UNC says that likelihood is very high while WakeMed asserts that it's very low.
To be specific, I'm talking about antibody tests. So, if that's the case, it sounds like LabCorp conducts a generic tests for UNC but conducts a better, more accurate test for WakeMed.
The note I got from UNC or was it labcorp, cant' remember they both sent me a note to encourage me get it but either way, I looked and the test they were providing said it was not one of the approved test kits, so I deleted it as I have no idea how accurate it is so why waste my time.
To my knowledge (and I haven't heard differently from my sis who works there), Labcorp currently only has one serum antibody test.  From their site:  ∗Negative results do not rule out SARS-CoV-2 infection, particularly in those who have been in contact with the virus. Follow-up testing with a molecular diagnostic should be considered to rule out infection in these individuals.  ∗Results from antibody testing should not be used as the sole basis to diagnose or exclude SARS-CoV-2 infection or to inform infection status.  ∗Positive results may be due to past or present infection with non-SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus strains, such as coronavirus HKU1, NL63, OC43, or 229E.  https://www.labcorp.com/tests/164055/sars-cov-2-antibody-igg  The decision is being made by the provider at the institutions as to whether they feel it's necessary given individual circumstances.

The FBI reportedly seized Republican Sen. Richard Burr's cell phone as part of an investigation into potential insider trading related to coronavirus

ironically, he voted yesterday to allow the fbi to access americans’ web history and search history WITHOUT A WARRANT
Good. Fuck that guy.
Glad they’re investigating so we can get the truth.
I hope he resigns
loloolollololololololololololooololololoooloololoolollololololololololololooololololoooloololoolollololololololololololooololololoooloololoolollololololololololololooololololoooloololoolollololololololololololooololololoooloololoolollololololololololololooololololoooloololoolollololololololololololooololololoooloo
The sooner he’s gone the better w/ Tillis in tow☝️
Lock that dude up. Anyone that profits off of the pandemic by downplaying the seriousness of it needs to go.
Somehow not surprised
slow walk it until after the election and we have a new AG.  No matter what they find DO NOT turn it over to Barr and this justice dept
finally.
Lock him up !!!!!
He won't spend a moment in jail and will land firmly on his feet. We're in a kleptocracy.
Honestly, if he doesn't serve out the rest of his term, then treasonous sack of shit McConnell will appoint a Trump toady to fill his spot as the chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, and nothing good would come of that. Burr at least has enough of a spine to not completely kowtow to these criminals.
Considering 45 thinks he didn't protect him enough, he's probably going to jail, more like Cohen instead of Manafort.
Hahahahahahahahah. Good. He sucks.
It only makes a difference if we get out!
Is. He a leprechaun ?
De-Burr NC!  De-Burr NC!
Yeeessssssssssss
Not relevant to the matter at hand, but his new beard is kind of dope
Can anyone provide the phone number to his office? Let's go Reddit, we need to floor him with calls again. I don't see him stepping drown as a Senator as of yet.
compared to Obama gate this is child’s play
*with the exception of members of Congress
Trump hates Burr, this is all part of the plan, unfortunately.
Wow, the exact words in my head when I read the title.  Spot on!
It's bittersweet.  I agree, fuck Burr, but this is probably revenge for him aiding with Mueller since he seems to be the only one being investigated.
Hopefully they go after the multiple other senators that engaged in the same behavior. Seems odd that they would just target Burr when there are others from both political parties that cashed out their investments after attending that meeting.
I have mixed feelings about this, personally.   I engaged in the exact same stock behavior, because I could see the writing on the wall. Sold most of my portfolio back when the dow was 29k, bought it back at 18k, and have made a hypothetical fortune since then.  I didn’t have any internal reporting that he had. Just public knowledge, and an obsession over the news. But I do feel like a kind of criminal, as half of the nation is crumbling.
I'm glad too but I kinda doubt we'll see the truth.  The FBI isn't known for their transparency and Burr being singled out despite everyone who did insider trading reeks of revenge from the Trump administration.  I'm glad this is happening I just hope it's for the right reasons which I unfortunately doubt.
If he resigns now, we get two Senate races this year.
I hope he goes to jail for the rest of his miserable life.
FBI is under the DOJ.  There is no way the DOJ hasn't cleared this in the first place.  Notice how it's only Burr and not the other senators?   The others are more loyal to Trump than Burr is.   We are fucked as a country.
Eh, Burr is already not running for another term. If you really want him out now, best case scenario is to let this investigation proceed (which will take a couple of months anyway), they find he violated the STOCK Act, he resigns 2 years early while another Republican serves out the rest of his term.   There are some serious ethical issues if a federal agency "slow walked" an investigation until another president was in power. The FBI already has a history chock full of corruption. We should want less of that, not more.
Shit. This is going to happen either way. He stepped down as committee chair.
Cal Cunningham is running against Tom Tillis. Not Burr. But I like your sentiment!
Is this sarcasm? or do you truly think Obamagate is a thing (it's not btw)
Compared to "Obamagate" this isn't a hoax.
is your comment intentionally funny or unintentionally funny
What constitutes Obamagate?
Of course can't forget that part
Is this a joke?
Unfortunate why? Best of my knowledge, Burr is a useless turd.
Agreed. Additionally, he was also working on another volume and more information regarding the involvement of Russia in our election. AG Barr is doing more of Trump's dirty work to hide damning evidence. That still does not excuse Burr from being a piece of garbage and a potential criminal guilty of insider trading.
Yeah, he's the foremost Republican actually stating that there was Russian interference, so this reeks of revenge.
When you look into the details, there is a major difference in the cases. Most Senators have their assets in a blind trust where they have no knowledge of trades and are not allowed to influence the trust manager's trades. Trades are still reported under their name as they are the owner.  Burr did not make use of such a trust. He traded himself. Pretty dumb as these blind trusts are in place specifically to avoid the situation he is in now.
You're not a criminal for making investment decisions based on the news and knowledge of what's going on in the world. That's how the market is intended to work.
Paging /u/JeffJacksonNC
I wouldn’t hold my breath.
I saw the mistake as i hit the enter key.    Point i am trying to make is to keep it in house and close too the vest before the elections and when we have a new ag is the time to drop the hammer on these dirty rats.
4 years ago i would 100% agree. I have about reached my breaking point and decided that playing by the rules against a an admin that coompletly ignore the rules and standards is not the way the go. It might be time to take off the gloves and play the same way they do for a bit then return things to the way they are supposed to be done.   of course the right says  the left has done that for years so its ok they dont play by the normal rules right now. problem is they are wrong. They are just brainwashed or stupid.
Ohh wow you’re right. I’m dumb. Still vote for Cal haha
Obama "did some things" but nobody seems to know what exactly. None of these dipshits will ever be able to give you a straight answer.
just spying on a political opponent while ur the outgoing president
You know we’re fucked when this is a legitimately good question.
The exception? I don't believe it is.
Burr was the chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee until he stepped down today. As chair, he authorized the release of a report that implicated Russia in election interference in 2016. This upset the president.
What a weird time we live in to be saying "yeah fuck that guy he deserves it, but wait no not like this."
Could be, but I think it might have something to do with his brother-in-law also dumping a ton of stock the same day as Burr. Hard to prove insider info if it's just you, but If people close to you are making the same moves its probably not a coincidence and he probably told them to do so. If I recall correctly, that's how they got Collins in NY, a bunch of family members made the same trades.
Well I got me a new house with a crazy low interest rate, my company was bailed out so I still have a job (knock on wood), and I am getting money in the mail from Uncle Sam.   Covid has been a financial gold mine. It’s evidence that our politicians are working _only_ for those in the professional class working at huge firms, and not those laboring or small businesses owners.
Jeff in DC would be ideal
So you want to politicize the DOJ?
So, let me get this straight: Because you think the presidential office is corrupt, you're okay with the FBI (one of the most important and powerful federal agencies in our country) also acting unethically in order to counter them, all for removing a Republican senator (who has often been an outspoken critic of the president) who, at that point, will only have less than 2 years remaining in his term, who is already not running for another term, and replacing him with *another* Republican, who could potentially be worse (an ally to the supposed "corrupt" president), who WOULD run for re-election, and possibly win another term meaning *6* more years of a Republican in that seat rather than 2?  That seems like a big sacrifice for a pitiful (and possibly counter to what you desire) result.
Oh, so nothing rooted in reality?
"Political opponent" LMAOOOOOO he was the OUTGOING 2-TERM PRESIDENT, he HAD NO POLITICAL OPPONENTS you absolute DUMB FUCK.
Temporarily stepping down.   It's not permanent.
It also has a lot to do with the fact that he didn't use a blind trust as the majority of politicians do. He traded himself. Key mistake.
IIRC Feinstein's husband also dumped stock the same day
Probably because so few have ever worked blue-collar, trade, or service industry jobs, all of which tend to take a hit during recessions, or whatever this is. I appreciate congresspeople like AOC who have worked hand to mouth jobs and can advocate for the millions of others who do.
The selfish part of me kinda wants to keep him in NC because he's such a great public servant here, but yeah, I'd like to see him in DC.
as if its not already under this admin
The argument is that the DoJ has been politicized under Barr, and a new AG would theoretically be less political in handling issues.   Also, going after politicians for this type of dirty dealing on their parts is hardly politicizing things.
> replacing him with another Republican ... who could potentially be worse  Not disagreeing with everything you wrote but NC uses Gubernatorial appointment to replace federal vacancies. He'd likely appoint A Republican a lot more middle-of-the-road.  Also it's a huge stretch to call Burr an "outspoken critic" of the President. He's at best a mild critic of him.  I've always thought of him as our better senator but this stock sale thing looks awfully tone deaf and bad.
its just not about burr. its about the many others up to no good and the ag just making it normal to ignore or cover up.   I am confident the FBI is going to do things the right way and within the rules despite my desire for them to get in the mud and play by the same ruless the admin plays by.
..? since you don’t believe this is even possible, it’s a proven fact that he did this exact thing with reporters while president. much like any president obama was very concerned about his image.
We'll have to wait and see on that one.
Are you sure he did it himself like Burr.? Pelosi's assets are in a blind trust. Likely her husband's as well. It will still be reported under their name.
Yeah, when people say “she’s a bartender, she doesn’t know anything” I think it’s ridiculous. If _anyone_ knows about the state of life for working people, it’s a bartender  Does she know the ins and outs of modern global economic policy? Maybe not. But the people who claim to have been knowledgeable on that have driven us off a cliff, and proven to be entirely out of touch with the average working person.
> Not disagreeing with everything you wrote but NC uses Gubernatorial appointment to replace federal vacancies.  Yes, and the governor has to replace the senator with someone from the same party.   >Also it's a huge stretch to call Burr an "outspoken critic" of the President. He's at best a mild critic of him.  I mean, as far as Republican senators go, I think it's fair to say he's been a critic.   >I've always thought of him as our better senator but this stock sale thing looks awfully tone deaf and bad.  Which is why I'm glad it's being investigated. I can see how this could potentially be a violation of the STOCK Act, but also potentially not. Our elected officials need to be held to the standards of the law. I hope the FBI does a good job and acts appropriately.  Edit- would the downvoters like to tell me what's incorrect, here?
Does watching Fox new make you stupid, or were you already stupid before you started watching?
Yea blows my mind. Feelings get in the way of facts. Not surprised by the downvotes.
idk never watched it
Then why are you repeating BS conspiracy nonsense that they invented and have been promoting?
probably because they aren’t the only ones reporting it...
No legitimate news source is reporting it as factual.
just google obama spying on reporters. and all your “legitimate news sources” will pop up

North Carolina hospital nurse said patients attending coronavirus parties, intentionally trying to get the virus

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=E6Kh3ayh1LA  This about sums it up
>We have heard from a lot of patients and the community that they're unafraid of getting the virus, so people are actually out and about trying to get the virus – attending gatherings, parties –just trying to maximize their chances of exposure," Yolanda Enrich, a nurse practitioner at Novant Health Forsyth Medical Center in Winston-Salem, told KOAT Action 7 News.  >Enrich told the tv station that patients attend such parties with the purpose of developing immunity to COVID-19 so that they no longer have to take precautions against the virus during their daily routines.  Wtf.
If they're not afraid of getting the virus, why are they taking precautions in the first place?
Those people are correct. The vast majority of people show little to no symptoms. That’s just the math of it. I’m not downplaying the severity of those that are hit hard by this disease, but let’s not make it out to be something it isn’t. If you are below 65 and have no compounding factors then you have a very low chance of a negative outcome.
> I've seen tons of people express their assumption that they will be fine if they get it  And they're probably correct, if they have no underlying conditions, and are younger than 65.

'N&O: North Carolina hits new high of coronavirus hospitalizations' Does it signal a spread in the virus, better reporting from hospitals, or both?


'N&O: NC hits new high of coronavirus hospitalizations ' is the virus spreading or are hospitals just reporting more?

I know at some hospitals, they JUST started testing every single inpatient for COVID, where they weren't testing them before. They were screening and only testing if they met the threshold for testing.  Bottom line is that it still seems our numbers are increasing with testing, but positive percentages and death rates are holding steady.
I work for UNC healthcare and the number of covid patients we have has more or less stayed steady since late April. Looking at the dashboard available to us, we currently have 507 ICU beds available out of 861 available across the state.
It's pretty clear there has been an increase in hospitalizations. It's' almost impossible to explain away the rise from ~500 hospitalizations on 5/17 to ~700 today because of reporting. That's almost a 50% increase. The article you linked is talking about spotty reporting in mid april, but I'm pretty sure the DHHS site has been at around 90% hospitals reporting for a while.   Governor Cooper keeps talking about looking at 14 day trends, but in his last address they didn't even put up any of the numbers. [There is a clear steady rise in hospitalizations over the last 18 days](https://covid19.ncdhhs.gov/dashboard/hospitalizations) and I hope he addresses this in his next briefing.
It's a good question.  the last time I looked at hospitalizations (about a week ago), only 78% were reporting.   But, without knowing what those 14% reported, there's no way to tell.  They're probably smaller, rural hospitals that don't have many patients.   The number of hospitalizations should be unaffected by an increase in testing, which should make it better measure of the virus' spread than the number of confirmed cases (which is affected by an increase in testing).
All I know is that Rex is no longer telling if a decedent is covid positive when they call the funeral home, citing it’s a violation of HIPAA. I’m waiting for my coworkers to completely kick off about it.
SARS-COV-2 spread like wildfire while we were in lockdown. So, I don’t think we are asking the right questions. The key is are there any pockets where this is spreading or is it a general spread across the population. For awhile it seemed like spread was focused in what I’ll call contained populations where people spend a lot of time in close proximity: nursing homes, prisons, meat processing factories, etc. What we don’t really get from NCDHHS is this level of granular data. COVID spreads readily in these areas.   As for the hospitals, lots of factors. If we look at the general trends, hospitals lag new cases by 2 weeks. The curves I saw this morning reflect this. So are hospitalized cases coming from all across the state or from high risk populations who live/work on high density clusters.  Does anyone have any granular data?
“Facts are stubborn things, but statistics are pliable.”   ― **Mark Twain**
Already reporting 1076 new positive cases today.   Phase -3.0 here we come!  Hospitalizations dropped 30 at least.
I've noticed they haven't dared have another 26,000+ testing day. Probably because they seen the increase in positive cases from that. Testing less than .1% isn't doing any good imho and we should be testing much more.  I'm not confident in the testing of this state right now. Let alone the reporting as well. Something just doesn't seem right.  Anyway, bring on the rebukes. I'm sure I'll hear the same that I heard before they tested more than 26,000 and made the claim that they weren't testing enough to get a reasonably accurate count.  Edit: And as for the hospitalizations. I'm not sure they're close to accurate either considering they were treating cases by symptoms rather than actually testing early on and up until recently.
I wish Roy Cooper would lay out exact cutoff criteria that would put us back in Phase 1 or 0. What would it take? 100% Hospital bed utilization? We only have 18% of ICU beds available already and hospitalizations are clearly rising significantly.
Just because you test positive doesn't mean you get hospitalized.  You have to be high risk, symptomatic and having obvious issues to get hospitalized.  My wife just gave birth at UNC and they tested her.  If she tested positive but asymptotic they would have sent us all home.  Hospitalizations going up is a bad sign... but there is hope.  At UNC the hospitalizations are way down.  This rise in hospitalizations seems very specific to certain hospitals which hopefully means it can be easier contained or counties can mirror better behavior (e.g. Orange County doing education on wearing masks, hygiene, etc).
More testing with the same percentage is bad news. As you point out, the more part of more testing is people with no symptoms, so more of them should have a negative test and the overall percentage of positive tests should decrease significantly. Unless, of course, infection rate is rising.
I’m confused, death rates aren’t holding steady. we had the highest reported deaths last Friday at 47, and two other high days last Wednesday and yesterday at 33 and 43 respectively.    I’m looking at the breakdown on coronavirus.1point3acres.com which is compiling data from CDC and Johns Hopkins
Total hospitalizations is an issue, but a more telling metric is new admissions per day. Also deaths. Also deaths that are not classified as covid19, but are related and much higher than normal for this time of year, like pneumonia. Apparently non-confirmed covid19 pneumonia deaths are running 500-1000% above normal.
Yes, that is why I asked... Is it more spread? Is it reporting? **Or is it both?**  No one is trying to explain anything away. Some of us are just asking questions for clarity so we can understand where we really are in the context of the entire Pandemic timeline. For instance, in that article, they state that :  "When about 25 additional North Carolina hospitals added in their missing numbers (that's about 20% of NC hospitals) that Tuesday the number of hospitalized patients leaped by more than 100, the largest increase since state officials began publishing the data."  So that day, we as citizens saw that 100 person spike and got the sense that the  the virus was accelerating in NC. But was that really what was happening? Actually those were existing numbers that simply hadn't been accounted for, and the net number is still the same, I get that. But what was the true number a week before that? Was that new net number a decrease from a week prior, flat, or actually an increase? We aren't able to tell without a full or at least a consistent data set.  Which we are now learning we never had until very recently.  No one is pointing blame here. A pandemic isn't anything we were expecting, however, simply noting the percentage of hospitals responding along with total hospitalizations would have at least given us an idea of the confidence levels we should be looking at that specific data with in the early going.  This is all-important simply because it is the way we, as a country, have decided to assess our risk and phase in our return to normalcy. We need absolute trust in our data if we are going to use it to dictate our policy.  I'm not saying which way it would go if all data was available:  \- Maybe they were way undercounting hospitalizations early on and the more reliable number we have now is a steeper decline from the peak than we thought.  \- Maybe they were way overcounting (although I'm not sure how having less responding hospitals could lower the hospitalization count),  \- Or maybe the number is rather insignificant and nothing much would have changed.  Whatever the case may be, it just would be appreciated if we could have the hospital reporting %'s  from the entire pandemic so we could match them up with hospitalization numbers by day and maybe get a more clear picture of where we really were, and where we are currently going..  If that data is already out there and I'm missing it, I apologize and could you please simply point me to it?
They certainly have not had 90%+ reporting for a while.
virus' deadly spread.  Just to clarify. The virus may be spreading and inconveniencing people but not to a life threatening status. I know hospital beds is the reason we want to flatten the curve, but it seems important to note that the virus can still be spreading.
Also had the biggest testing day ever with 15,704. That would equal a 6.8% positive rate, which is a slight drop but mostly flat.   As you stated hospitalizations were net -30 (good news).   The bad news is the 32 new deaths coming on the board. That's sad for sure, but note that deaths reported today shouldn't be a marker for where we are heading since the death numbers lag the cases/hospitalizations by a good bit.  So I know you were saying it in jest, but yeah, we're not really on our way to phase 3, but we should be squarely in phase 2 at this point.   The uptick in cases has been corresponding with uptick in tests. So the % positive has been holding very steady and actually dropping the rolling average. Hospitalizations are up and down, but can't really be totally trusted prior to May 10th (hospital % reporting numbers are in questions per N&O and WRAL. Meaning, we were likely a lot higher, and have seen a steady decline since April. Now we are slightly up since May 10, but still it's hard to tell with inconsistencies in reporting almost unavoidable and up and downs only in the 20's and 30's daily. Deaths have been mostly low and flat. 2 days ago we had two deaths it seem sand then we spike to 32 yesterday (not on the dashboard yet). So not really sure how that happens, but it's either a coincidence or report timing was a little off. Average those 2 days out and we're right where you'd expect us to be on that curve. Mostly flat but down from peaks in April
You do realize that testing is expensive, not only in terms of money but also in terms of finite resources like reagents and PPE?  Unless you have a warehouse full of both that we don't know about, rationing to a reasonable degree so that we can continue to provide testing despite shortages is the right answer.
What is a reasonable number of tests per day?
So I saw someone cite that number yesterday as well and the dashboard is a bit misleading.  At this point in the process, hospitals are testing all patients. Which means that if you're hospitalized, and have covid, you're in the "currently hospitalized" count.  Today, 708 people have been hospitalized with covid. Meanwhile, there are 2,635 ICU beds currently in use. If we assume that all hospitalized patients are in the ICU, which is false, that still means that covid is accounting for only 26% of current ICU use. We're also currently using 818 ventilators out of 3366.  Keep in mind, hospitals typically run with ICUs at 65-70% capacity.  Let's take 65% as an estimate because that's more typical, with 70% being the estimate only in inner city areas of the country like NYC. That means the remaining 35% of the ICU is our wiggle room that can provide care for covid patients, and we're currently only using 50% of it.  So if we want a less misleading picture, we need to take it as 50% of ICU space that we have at our disposal for this disease is currently in use.  &#x200B;  Exact criteria is tricky because the data isn't so simple. An outbreak at a large nursing home will drastically increase hospitalizations for a few weeks but doesn't represent an increased threat to the general population, for example.
The problem with exact cutoff criteria is that we learn more and more every day.  Yesterday's exact criteria may not match up with what we think might be appropriate today.
What I meant by "testing every single inpatient" is that they are auto-testing people that admitted to the hospital for non-COVID emergencies. Or as you just pointed out, giving birth. Two weeks ago, your wife wouldn't have been tested for COVID unless she was symptomatic. As such, she could have been positive-asymptomatic and that would have gone un-recorded.
That doesn't match the NC dashboard which shows are highest day was in mid-April, but we have occasionally come close as recently as the 25th. [https://covid19.ncdhhs.gov/dashboard/cases](https://covid19.ncdhhs.gov/dashboard/cases)  edit: looking at your data, I don't see the discrepancy that you are seeing. The numbers appear to be mostly in in line with the NC data with the highest day involving 27 deaths. Not sure where you are seeing the 33, 43, and 47.
https://web.archive.org/web/20200510135352/https://covid19.ncdhhs.gov/dashboard#by-reporting-hospitals  Wayback machine has this page indexed on May 10th and shows 90% of hospitals reporting.
https://web.archive.org/web/20200510135352/https://covid19.ncdhhs.gov/dashboard#by-reporting-hospitals  Maybe not "a while", but at least since may 10th.
Noted. I should have stated that, but I just am assuming the CDC's death rate is correct and consistent ([it's 0.27%](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/planning-scenarios.html)). Meaning, as cases track, so should hospitalizations and thus, so should deaths.  \*However, if their estimated death rate is a work in progress, then it's entirely possible that we uncover way more cases that we weren't aware of....but yeah, if death counts don't tick up with that increase then you're only answers are that there are either A LOT of unaccounted for deaths, or this virus' death rate is even lower than we thought.)
Well, OK.   If that's the case, then I guess we shouldn't care.  But, my point was just that if X% of people with the virus go into the hospital, and X is fairly constant, then the number of hospitalized people is a good proxy.
OCME has access to medical records so they would know if someone in their care was C19+. But, most cases don’t go through the OCME & I think they’re currently being very particular about the cases they are taking on for the protection of their employees.  As far as I know, OCME, WakeMed & the nursing homes will still tell us as we have a different protocol for C19+ removals.
I can tell you .08% of the population of the state is far too little of the population to be tested daily. If "track and trace" is anything of substance and the state wants this to happen I'm certain less than .1% isn't going to benefit that method.   You can't "track and trace" anything if you don't know who does and doesn't have the virus. I can't say what the percentage of test should be per day but I can make a reasonable hypothesis that what's being done now is insufficient for that method to succeed.
Thanks for this link, I wasn’t finding daily deaths by state listed other places. I’m looking at the death chart and hovering to see ‘new deaths’ when the data is narrowed down to NC.
Thanks. That's super helpful, so we can assume May 10ths data is pretty accurate. It would be interesting to see data from around May 14th-16th (around 2 weeks ago when this article was posted) and also to find that data around April 14th (around the national death peak). Are you able to find those? If you don't have the time, no worries, I will try after work.  *edit: I got a bit of free time and went to the Wayback machine to look for answers to my questions. Thanks for the tip* u/brainchrist  \- Could not find data prior to May 10th-   \- 90% on May 10th   \-- 78% on May 11th   \-- 83% on May 12th   \-- 87% on May 13th   \-- 92% on May 14th   \-- 92% on May 15th   \-- 91% on May 16th   \-- 85% on May 17th   \-- 85% on May 18th   \-- 82% on May 19th   \-- Wayback machine keeps sending me to May 21st numbers on this day   \--  89% on May 21st   \-- From May 22nd to May 26th Wayback sends me to May 21st numbers   \- According to N&O 92% yesterday  (May 27)  NC has 126 hospitals in NC according to Wikipedia.. So as a reference that would mean   \-- 82% = 23 hospitals unreported   \-- 92% = 11 hospitals unreported  Just to give you an idea. So since the dashboard has been out reporting has been pretty good and consistent.  But we aren't able to see % reporting from before that. I think having that would tell us a lot more. I'm guessing that is the time period N&O is referring to and the data they are pressing DHHS to provide.  Does this sound right?
Only for a couple of days since may 10th, the rest of those dates we dipped back under 90, but ok
You are right. Hospitalizations were always the strongest metric. Cases have had so many definitions and variations along the way. Deaths lag by around 14 days from initial onset of the virus. So hospitalizations is your best in the moment picture of where we are.
Still not seeing your numbers on that site, but I am seeing numbers on that site that match the state's own data, so I'm having an easier time accepting those numbers.
That's good information to have, but I think the other data point you need is the total beds available/in use from day to day. The number of COVID-19 cases may depend on how many tests have been done, but the number of people in the hospital for all reasons should only rise, I assume, if there are more actual cases. Although I am sure there other factors that cause fluctuations in hospitalizations, but certainly the virus seems like a major influence these days.   So, level bed capacity combined with more total cases would mean that we are simply detecting and reporting more cases. Fluctuating bed capacity in line with fluctuations in reporting would probably indicate the same thing. But an overall increase of occupied beds that can't be accounted for by increased reporting very likely means a higher number of infected people.
I think you can adjust the slider on the top of the page to see other dates. May 10th was as far back as it went though.
Also important to note that hospitalizations require context. Was it 10 completely unrelated hospitalizations? Outbreak at an assisted living facility, where people are much more predisposed to being hospitalized but less predisposed to spreading the virus outside of their facility? Prison outbreak with less predisposition toward hospitalization but still little general spread? Which counties?  Increases of hospitalizations are not one to one with increases in case numbers, because an outbreak at a college dorm would yield a much smaller number of hospitalizations than an outbreak at a nursing home.  I wish that data was available to us, but HIPAA and stuff.
Something to consider is that total occupied beds is going to be increasing because hospitals have restarted elective and other surgeries and procedures. Which in turn is also discovering more positive people because those folks are being tested preop
Yes. I think the ICU beds will be the number with the most relevance.  I don't think elective surgeries will have much effect on that. Unless they go terribly wrong.
True. Although some of those surgeries starting back up do require ICU stays. Brain surgery for example, some spine surgeries, etc. So maybe not a huge effect but some.
