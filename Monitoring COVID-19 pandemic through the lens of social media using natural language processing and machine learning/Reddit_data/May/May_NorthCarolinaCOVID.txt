Blue Cross/Blue Shield North Carolina - Political Influence (COVID-19 April 2020)
  We’re getting to the end of May 2020. I want to bring up a report that Mandy Cohen, MD promoted on April 6.Blue Cross/Blue Shield North Carolina is a $10 billion healthcare insurance company with an enormous amount of state power and very few barriers to pushing their political influence on everyone. I think they suck as an organization (and we deserve better).But, I am impressed by their political influence to produce blatantly false reports and get it read on local news. The organization has no shame in saying we – at BC/BS NC - staffed it with some of the most conflicted “business side of the house” people in our organization (it’s in plain English: the actuary, the medical expense strategy – they didn’t even “cloak” it by offering a doctor! OMG!)Let’s go back to April 6: BC/BS NC’s report (staffed by their employees) states 250,000 – 750,000 COVID-infected North Carolinians (2.4% - 7.1% of the State Population) “by the end of our forecast period, June 1 2020.” The epidemiologists (“paid hires” for BC/BS NC) emphasized the point “these estimates include unconfirmed infections. Thus, the additional stress imposed on the health care system is a direct result of having roughly three times as many infected North Carolinians (750,000 vs. 250,000) over the same time period.” Here's the link for a refresh: [https://www.newsobserver.com/news/coronavirus/article241797076.html](https://www.newsobserver.com/news/coronavirus/article241797076.html)We are here on May 15: today’s actual data is 16,500 COVID-infected North Carolinians.I’m saying it to North Carolinians again: this healthcare company uses scare tactics to get their way.Bradley Adams, MS.

Here's what I wrote on April 6th:   [https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronaNC/comments/g597xo/remember\_april\_6th\_two\_reports\_released\_one\_press/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronaNC/comments/g597xo/remember_april_6th_two_reports_released_one_press/)
I like to look at the bright side and say that these tactics are more in our favor in the long run. This is very basic thought processing but I guess I may as well write it out.  1) Scare tactics work, in some capacity. I tell my future kid about illegal drugs that he's never heard of, until recently, that they can possibly kill him. He's most likely gonna avoid it until he's got the capacity to learn more about why I said that to him. Feels like the scare tactic made people stay at home, which in turn lowered potential infection rates, which could have contributed to the prediction they made on the 6th, which is now considered a scare tactic, because people stayed inside......... Oh well. Some consider it bullshit, I consider it funny.   2) People like you can confirm long running suspicions that unethical businesses have the capacity to run, like any pandemic profiteering. You, and many others most likely won't be supporting them much after this. They'll hopefully connect the dots to why.   Although, I don't see them aiming to cull any herds of people for profit. Seems to me like, yeah, they as a whole don't want to lose money to this virus as do all of us (though they're a large company. They should do what they all should, and use it for the better since it's being lost anyway).   But I've seen exponential values in 6th grade, I know this virus was predicted to, and in fact can, infect people at a disturbingly high rate. But it hasn't, and they are wrong so far, and more people are staying safe and avoiding infection rather than rolling the low-mortality-rate dice. The only people that I worry about are the ones that just don't care at all, or are bewilderingly misinformed and uneducated.
Another policy article:  http://pulse.ncpolicywatch.org/2020/04/06/social-distancing-policies-might-need-extended-past-april-to-ensure-hospital-bed-supply/  If North Carolina’s social distancing policies end this month as scheduled, there is a 50% chance that hospitals statewide could not handle the number of patients infected with COVID-19.  That is the conclusion of statistical modeling conducted by university and government researchers and released today.  “To save lives we need to make sure we flatten the curve,” said Dr. Pia D.M. MacDonald, senior director and senior epidemiologist with RTI International, based in Research Triangle Park. “The more social distancing, the more lives can be saved.”  Nearly 3,000 people have tested positive for COVID-19 in North Carolina, although because of testing limitations  that is most certainly a vast undercount. About 270 people are hospitalized; 33 others have died from the virus. Gov. Roy Cooper’s stay-at-home order expires April 29. That order prohibits gatherings of more than 10 people and has closed all businesses except those considered essential, such as pharmacies and groceries.  The researchers emphasized that they aren’t recommending a specific policy; nor are they suggesting the stay-at-home order remain in effect indefinitely. Yet they did underscore that  social distancing, as it’s currently implemented, would help ensure the state’s hospital system isn’t overwhelmed over the next three months as a result of the pandemic.  The conclusions are based on a composite of several models that are specific to North Carolina. These models considered two scenarios: one that assumed social distancing remains in effect — and that people comply with the order — after April 29; and the second that all restrictions would be lifted after that time.  If social distancing remains in effect, the probability of a bed shortage, for both acute cases and the most severe requiring intensive care, is just 22% through June, said Dr. Aaron McKethan, an adjunct professor at the Duke University School of Medicine. If social distancing is lifted, the probability rises to 50%.  “We all want to get this pandemic behind us and get back to work,” McKethan said. “We want to keep policy officials informed as much as possible,” when weighing the costs to the economy and public health. The models don’t examine local hotspots or regional differences in the number of available hospital beds and ventilators. Researchers said they plan to delve into that data soon.  The three models disagree on the timing of peak in demand for hospital beds if social distance policies are relaxed. Some models predict the peak would occur in May, others in June or July. “All models agree that we have a shortage,” said Dr. Mark Holmes, professor at the Gillings School of Global Public Health at UNC Chapel Hill. “The question is when.”  A University of Washington model released this morning was more optimistic. Those researchers now predict 500 people in North Carolina would die from COVID-19, down from 2,400 originally forecast. North Carolina researchers had received that report shortly before the media call and said they hadn’t yet analyzed it. However, McDonald said North Carolina’s models accounted for the state’s ” unique attributes and are more granular than what you see out of the University of Washington.”  State officials have not announced how today’s findings could influence the governor’s stay-at-home order or state and local social distancing policies. The NC Department of Health and Humans Services and other state agencies have scheduled another briefing today at 4 p.m.  No related posts.
https://www.wwaytv3.com/2020/04/07/experts-distancing-rules-improve-north-carolina-hospital-odds/  RALEIGH, NC (WWAY) — A collection of North Carolina experts Monday released a composite modeling forecast looking at how COVID-19 could affect North Carolina in the coming months. The models, constructed by experts from University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Duke University, RTI International, and others reinforced the need for limiting personal contact to slow the spread of COVID-19 and ensure that health care is there for people who need it.  “We have life-changing decisions before us and North Carolina is fortunate to have world-class experts who can help our state as we continue battling the coronavirus,” said Governor Roy Cooper. “Modeling is one tool that helps us prepare for this fight and it shows we will save lives if we stay home and keep our social distance right now.”  “The modeling affirms that the actions we take now will determine how this virus will impact North Carolina in the weeks and months to come,” said NC Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Mandy Cohen, MD. “We need to continue to do everything in our power so that fewer people get sick at the same time, while also surging the capacity of our health care system so those that do need hospital care will have it. Please stay home now to save lives.”  Today’s composite model found that social distancing policies with effectiveness similar to those currently in place in North Carolina will help lower the likelihood of the healthcare system becoming overloaded with a spike of many COVID-19 patients all at the same time. However, ending all social distancing at the end of April leads to a “greater than 50 percent probability that acute care and ICU bed capacity will be outstripped… as soon as Memorial Day.” According to the model, hospital surge to create more available bed space could provide some help, but not enough to help hospitals meet demand if all social distancing efforts were ended.  If all social distancing were to stop at the end of April, the model estimates that roughly 750,000 North Carolinians could be infected by June 1. On the other hand, if some form of effective social distancing remains in place after April, that number is lowered by half a million to an estimated 250,000 people. That’s because social distancing lowers the number of people that one person will infect. The group of experts are continuing to run models using information from other states and countries and intends to release further data as it becomes available.
https://www.courier-tribune.com/news/20200407/groundwork-laid-to-extend-north-carolina-social-distancing-rules-beyond-april  North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper and health researchers laid groundwork on Monday to convince the public that social distancing orders could be needed beyond April to preserve hospital beds, dull COVID-19′s spread and save lives.  Cooper’s current statewide stay-at-home order, which also prevents gatherings of more than 10 people, took effect a week ago and continues until April 29. A ban on dine-in service at restaurants and bars began March 17 and now continues until April 24. Cooper already has closed public schools through May 15. As elsewhere in the country, North Carolina’s restrictions have contributed to a historic spike in unemployment benefit claims.  Cooper’s state Department of Health and Human Services gave the virtual stage to a team of epidemiologists and other health policy experts. They produced a report on whether the state’s hospitals will have enough bed capacity to treat an expected surge of patients with the new coronavirus.  The report, based on three independent research models, calculated chances that acute-bed capacity would be insufficient to handle the expected increase. If North Carolina maintains social distancing policies similar in effectiveness to those today, the chance is about 25% through June 1. If all social distancing policies are lifted after April, the chance grows to 50%, with rising bed demand taking shape by late May. Increasing the number of beds decreases the percentages only slightly, the report said.  Maintaining social distancing policies “will likely allow our health care system to be able to manage the disease as it spreads throughout the state,” Mark Holmes, director of the Cecil G. Sheps Center for Health Services Research at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, told reporters in a conference call. “Relaxing all social distancing policies on April 29 could place substantial pressure on hospitals that could be outside of their ability to manage.”  The brief’s authors, who also included researchers from Duke University and RTI International, emphasized they weren’t recommending a specific course of action. That would be up to Cooper and other elected leaders.  “Modeling is one tool that helps us prepare for this fight and it shows we will save lives if we stay home and keep our social distance right now,” Cooper said in a news release highlighting the report.   North Carolina DHHS data coming from a majority of state hospitals show that about one-third of inpatient beds and one-in-five intensive care unit beds are currently empty. The department reported more than 2,850 positive COVID-19 cases of Monday. Thirty-three patients have died and at least 270 are currently hospitalized.  The report’s composite models generate stark case number estimates. They forecast 250,000 North Carolina residents could be infected by June 1 if current or similar social distancing policies stay in place. If the policies end, that number reaches 750,000.  For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, and the vast majority survive. But for others, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause pneumonia or death.  The researchers didn’t project death totals. Pia MacDonald, a senior epidemiologist at RTI, said if hospitals run out of beds and patients don’t get access to care, “we will have more deaths.”  The state prison system, where seven prisoners in three facilities have now tested positive, announced Monday that it would begin a two-week moratorium on accepting new offenders from county jails starting Tuesday. Prison-to-prison transfers also will be limited severely.  “We must deny this virus the opportunity to spread,” prison commissioner Todd Ishee said.

If COVID-19 is part of Infected Human (or Cat/Ferret) Poo, It's All Over The Hotel Room - says China Study
We knew this in March (after the cruise ship fiasco) but peer review literature takes time to publish. I wish I was at THAT press conference. I would watch the person responsible for sign language. **Studies: COVID-19 virus can spread through feces, surfaces contaminated by presymptomatic patients.** Infectious virus in feces is a common manifestation of COVID-19, according to a [study](http://send.aha.org/link.cfm?r=oNoHhwgs6F2sBeK3Mmtygg~~&pe=QGDCMo8fgHyY1I1m6JtKyuHfqUc5MlR_GhhQ-6Kgo2nkrvr2oZD0F4jiEV7hVc9tzgZ6OlZ9W7rdNiD6vjGVVg~~&t=Y-3DyKQ-4iiy50frqSRQmQ~~) from China published today in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Emerging Infectious Diseases journal. "Our findings indicate the need for appropriate precautions to avoid potential transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from feces," the authors said. "Discharge and hospital cleaning practices should consider this possibility for critically ill patients or those who died who had high viral loads and are more likely to shed infectious virus."Another [study](http://send.aha.org/link.cfm?r=oNoHhwgs6F2sBeK3Mmtygg~~&pe=IsgrF3YngOW7MH3DIc6HIXpew1bOflpNEnwWb1EzQ6Sa8qpz9tC9WwDAcbZgqyE3DdOuNR3bhtzKvG42-tR2AQ~~&t=Y-3DyKQ-4iiy50frqSRQmQ~~) from China published in the journal investigated environmental contamination in two rooms of a quarantine hotel after two presymptomatic students who stayed there were laboratory-confirmed as having coronavirus disease. "We detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA on eight (36%) of 22 surfaces, as well as on the pillow cover, sheet, and duvet cover," demonstrating that presymptomatic patients can easily contaminate environments, the authors said. "Our data also reaffirm the potential role of surface contamination in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and the importance of strict surface hygiene practices, including regarding linens of SARS-CoV-2 patients," they said.

I really hope to see some change in NCs politics. The RNC has completely failed the country, if not working completely against it for their own personal gain.

SARS-CoV-2 is well adapted for humans. What does this mean for re-emergence?

Ain't nothin' nice.
I like how they frame the discussion: animal traders/food distributors need to fess up now or we're just going to repeat a new spread. If we believe nature vs. nurture: The bat cave (with coronavirus) is in the vicinity of Wuhan market - right?  With SARS, I think they killed/picked/sampled everything in search of a vector. This article says: Nothing yet.   I know I'm going to get blow-back: This isn't the right forum for conspiracy theory or discussion of "precursor" viral origins. This all happened 6-months ago... and worth a pause to ponder.
