Home Depot employee tested positive for Covid-19

It would be newsworthy if one of these places didn't have a case.
It's probably a given by now that we're in stores with people who carry the virus asymptomatically and are unconfirmed. Hearing the actual confirmed cases though in essential environments is scary.
how did you find this info? can’t find anything on google. concerned as my dad uses this store for his supplies daily.
Just left the Matthews location. Hazard a guess that 80% people had no masks or gloves and definitely cared nothing about distance. Saw zero employees with any ppe. Easy for some place like this to be a super spreader.
Source?
Neat
Is there a news article? Or is this first hand knowledge
Thats a shame. I hope they recover.
What department did they work in? I used to work at that store now I’m curious
These are the things we need to hear about. It's not going to be just one person magically testing positive. If they have it, chances are very high other employees there now have it and some customers could be at high risk for getting it, now.
HIPAA doesn't apply in this situation, I guess...
They just found out today and told the employees
Manger calls us in for meeting and told us about who tested positive for Coronavirus.
First source from an employee
HIPAA is between a patient and their provider.  If whoever has it told their boss, or pretty much anyone who isn't their healthcare provider, that person can tell whoever they want.
No shit
They told you who tested positive?   When we had a positive case at my grocery store, HR wouldn’t tell us who they were, for their privacy....even though we were worried it may have been someone we could have potentially worked closely with.  Stay safe, handy friend!
They said who? Sounds like a hipaa violation.

What restaurant are you missing the most and plan on visiting ASAP post COVID-19?
Personally, I dream of Mr. Tokyo. I want to hurt myself with sushi.
Futo Buta, Diamond, and Soul Gastrolounge. But with the warmer weather here to stay...catch me on a patio anywhere in the city as soon as it’s safe enough to do so.  ETA: La Preferida (formally La Unica) because ya girl needs authentic tacos and salsa
Villanis bakery. Not a restaurant but I would stop by there at least once a week for macarons or crumb cake
Yamazaru. I cant wait to be basic again and go to Sycamore in the afternoon and then Yamazaru for dinner.
New Zealand Café. Also planning on hurting myself with sushi.
Alexander Michael's
Mr. Tokyo here, too! Gonna go nuts on the all-you-can-eat sushi and order a nice bottle of sake to celebrate when everything goes back to normal.
Johnny Burito,  Jack Beagles in NoDa (Fried Mushrooms!), Taqueria Mexico
the bar.
Seoul Food Meat Company. Best restaurant in Charlotte.
Kid Cashew Pisces sushi buffet Summit Room
Pacos Tacos & Tequila, Bakersfield
Mr. Tokyo was the last restaurant I went to, and will probably be the first after this all blows over.
Midwood smokehouse, carry out is not the same
Mert's Heart & Soul.  The best cornbread I've ever had.
OMB Biergarten.
Dumpling Lady
Gotta say I really want some Cajun Queen
Any old sports bar.  I have favorites but really I just miss the atmosphere and would even go to a bw3 at this point.
Paco Tacos, they are not even doing take out right now.
Burrito Factory on South Blvd
Yaki Asian Fresh seafood boil although I discovered Yummy Crab in the meantime
Metro Diner
Rusans sushi buffet.
Lets meat, optimist hall,
Harmony Hall at Carowinds.
Guess I need to try Mr. Tokyo!
Tavern on the Tracks.  Had a powerful craving for their wings the other day.
Bakersfield. Although I don’t see myself eating out before vaccines are available.
O-Ku
I've started having cravings for places I'd rarely or never go to before, like I really want Dennys now.
Waldhorn
Waffle House
Anywhere for a burger and fries and some wings with a tall cold draft beer. Mac's Speed shop looks cool, I think we've wanted to go there.  I realize we can get that now. Fried stuff just doesn't travel well, so getting take out is disappointing. I talked to the wife about this last night, since stuff may very well start opening soon. I think she wants to be conservative through the end of May. Which is great, I've been eating really healthy and if I can stick with it through May, I'll be in good shape for summer and ready to crush a giant burger.
Another Broken Egg
Lets meat
Crispy crepe, the blue Taj, midnight diner Sigh...
Seoul Food!
I need to eat brunch at zada janes with a bottle of bubbles after my horrible brunch shift like no ones business.
Anyone know if the Halal cart uptown is still there? I used to go there prolly once a week lol.
Bad Daddy's.
Via Roma
Chima. Lol
Not restaurants but I miss the hell out of Central Coffee in South End. There’s some things I don’t like about it but it’s by far the most comfortable coffee shop in the city (I’m picky when it  comes to seating and lighting)  I have an exam to study for to get my geology license and I just hate studying at home.
Tamales la Pasadita
Fin and Fino for the cocktails
Thanks for the tips!  My life revolves around ramen as well, as any sane persons should.  Totally agree that they need more broth!  I’ll definitely give the miso a try next time!
The Flying Biscuit too!
Boiling Pot
Rockin' Roll Sushi!!!!!!
Mama Ricottas
Caswell Station is Big Ben, World of Beer
...IF they are still in business.   Sorry
Try the tacos from Las Meras Tortas.   That place is solid AF.
$1 tacos on Thursday are life
What do you get at Futo Buta?  I’ve been and had the tonkastu ramen and several appetizers and I thought it was severely lacking flavor.  The broth just tasted of salt- incredibly bland.  Did I just go on a bad day?
Azteca's pretty good and I've been wanting to try Diamond.
They're soooo good! Amelie's who?
I'm so excited to try this place. Amelie's is dried out crappy pastries.
I love Villanis too.
The key lime pie tho 👀🤤
Seconded for Yamazaru
Open for takeout
Is that place good? Went to the Harris Teeter next to it a few months ago and it caught my eye. It's New Zealand cuisine?
Already told my girlfriend this is the first place we are eating after all of this is over
This
Ditto! I want to have to be rolled out of Mr. Tokyo's.
Johnny Burrito for sure
I worked there for a bit, no matter how many times I had the Cheesesteak Eggrolls they were amazing. Craving them with a Keep Pounding Punch
They and Let's Meat are doing delivery, if that makes you feel any better. They have an everyday 9-mile radius and they deliver to a different area outside of that each day of the week.
Same here!
Man, I had Midwood tonight and it was greasy as all hell. Almost like they’re smoking differently or something.
Especially with the great weather we’ve had.
They have take out!
They are now. Eating tacos as I type. Yum
They just opened back up in the last few days again for take out!
Omggg the croissant French toast with strawberry butter 🤤
Not a fan. Had the famous meatloaf...meh..cold and bland. Hubby had the eggs Benedict, which also arrived cold with congealed sauce.
Gah I love Optimist Hall
Dumpling Lady
Assuming Carowinds even opens this year, the crowds are going to be insane
If you don't know, now you know!
Same here. I bought some gift cards from them online after they closed. They are on of my favs.
Wings and beer—-lebowskis! I love macs BUT Macs has great barbecue 😋. Defs go for that and not wings
It's still there and open!
They're still doing delivery via UberEats.  Tried it over the weekend and it was pretty good.
I miss the veggie sandwich at Caswell the most
Ooooh, we’ll have to give it a try when the time finally comes!
My life basically revolves around ramen, and I concur that their tonkotsu broth is not rich or salty enough. I also feel like all of their ramen bowls need a higher ratio of broth to noodles. Now, the vegan ramen - that broth is surprisingly good!
I consistently get the miso and have a semi complicated order. I get half noodle because I’m a broth lover and add extra veggies. We love the shishito peppers and any of the buns as well! I agree, I’ve had a couple of underwhelming visits — but the good ones outweigh any of those.
wait until you find renaissance patisserie
Yeah I've done it, but it's not the same.
It’s a mix of sushi and, like, rack of lamb type dishes. But I’ve never seen anyone having anything but the sushi.
It's relatively cheap sushi that tastes great imo. It's no O-Ku but great for casual sushi. Only bad thing is the wait. Sometimes it's 20 - 40 to get a table because seating is so limited. Well, I suppose it was... :(
So good. And Best Wok next door to New Zealand is probably my favorite Chinese restaurant in Charlotte.
Ironically that matches my waist circumference being 1.4 times the prepandemic...
Yeah, got some about 2 weeks ago I think.  I’ll probably hit them up one more time before Charlotte opens-back-up, and it gets fucking nuts.
I just had it for the first time on Saturday and I’m just getting over the indigestion it gave me lol. Still tasted pretty good though!
Right, I haven't seen anyone bitch about kids at OMB in 6 weeks now. Maybe get a beer at a brewery without a kids area?
I love everything I've had there but I think the chicken and waffles are my fave!
Oh man sorry to hear that, did you send it back or let them know? They usually have good customer service imo but it may depend on which location you go to.
I am just glad they're honoring 2020 season passes and add-ons for 2021 as well. People are gonna be too spooked to go when they open, I'm gonna be there regardless. We got gold passes, meal plans AND all year fast passes.
Great thank you!  I'm a fan of normal chicken sized wings. Not mutated giant freak wings with tons of breading that have become really common. Any observations on that from Lebowski's? We haven't been here that long and honestly had been waiting for spring/summer to start going out in town. Whoops!
Omg I need to get down there then!  Thanks!
I don't trust UberEats. Too many pot heads eating my meal on the way over. I don't blame them, you break even doing that job.
Is that the one in southpark? If yes I've had their macarons and they're amazing and I wanna rub them all over my body. (that escalated quickly)
Yea, I know what you mean.
Yeah, food that is prepped for consumption (sushi, pizza and such) are not as good when you get home. Things that take hours to cook (bbq, soup) on the other hand...
Just thinking about complaining puts me on edge.
I have a Gold Pass, paper-cup Drink Plan and the All-Season Dining Plan. I go pretty often just to get something to eat.
They seem pretty normal to me!
If it's any consolation, I've ordered delivery from all the services and never had an issue with unprofessional drivers.
Yessir. Personally I enjoy their croissants.
It's not even a bar. It's an open biergarten with a restaurant. Been there dozens of times and never had an issue with kids. Maybe if you didn't focus on the possibility of kids annoying you so much it wouldn't bother you as much. I don't even notice them.
Yeah same here...I try not to but there's a way to do it w/o sounding ****** about it 😉
I'll order a croissant next time sounds delish!
I’m not sure if they still sell their bacon bread but it was amazing.
I DID have a child at brewery lick me once. I was too shocked to do anything but scream “ where are your parents bud” in a shrill voice
> 'Its not a bar, it's a brewery' is a pretty weak argument.  Considering they have completely different atmospheres and are used for more than "just drinking" no its not. Breweries are for events, shops, drinking, eating, hanging with friends, relaxing, etc. Yeah keep bitching about loud kids when you keep going to a brewery with a dedicated kids area. That's like going to Sycamore on a Saturday and bitching about all the frat-chads and kayleigh's whose dogs won't stop getting in your way. Maybe put your energy into enjoying your beer and not focusing on shit that annoys you.
You're so wrong its not even funny.  Biergartens are family friendly.  They have food, they have socialization, its outdoors, its like a picnic.  Go to Germany and you'll see kids and families all over the place at them.  They're basically parks, with yes, playgrounds.  If you want to drink alone by yourself in quiet, go to a bar.  A biergarten is not a bar.

State and Local Leaders Still in Denial about COVID-19
I realize that continuing the lockdown indefinitely would be catastrophically harmful to our economy and well being. So, I don't really want to get into a debate about what is more important, saving lives or re-opening the economy.However, the problem is that many people, including our Democratic our leaders, are just not facing up to the scientific reality. We are scheduled to reopen tomorrow even though our infection rate has only plateaued, and we are still not testing nearly enough. And contact tracing is too insignificant relative to the infection rate to be effective.  Testing without contact tracing is largely useless in controlling an epidemic.What this ultimately means is that we are accepting defeat against the virus and choosing to reopen the economy anyway.  Every epidemiologist I've read or heard on TV is telling us that it is too soon to re-open. No state has met federal guidelines to reopen, which were weak to begin with.To be clear, I am also not suggesting that we remain locked down indefinitely,  because the economic harm would also be catastrophic. What I'm suggesting is that we mobilize like other countries in ramping up testing, tracing and PPE as well as investing more heavily in R&D for treatments and vaccines. We even pulled funding from the WHO, basically meaning we want defund global  vaccine studies.Other countries are proving that testing and tracing techniques work. Germany is coming out of lock down now after their infection rate sloped down into a trough. And they didn't lock down as severely as other countries like Spain and Italy.  They achieved this by testing and tracing.Meanwhile, we continue our death march in denial about scientific reality. We are about to see a great tragedy unfold that is largely avoidable, both economically and in terms of public health.
Phase 1 doesn’t seem drastically different than what we are currently doing. They are going to monitor for 2 weeks and see from there.  Yeah increased testing and contact tracing is obviously ideal. It’s not happening for whatever reason.   I am so tired of all the doom and gloom. You might be right, I hope you arent. But shitposting on Reddit isn’t going to change anything.  Wheels are in motion, hope for the best. It’s not like this phased strategy was developed in a vacuum by politicians, epidemiologists and people who understand it way better than any of us on Reddit were involved
We’ve need to focus on ramping up testing since the beginning. It absolutely blows my mind that we’re still saying we need to ramp up testing in May. It’s unbelievable.   At this point, your safety is up to you as an individual. Our federal and state governments have made that clear.
The following comment is centered around Vaccines. I see a lot of concern and confusion(For Good reason) so I thought I would share some of the resources I have found helpful.  De-funding the WHO at this point is probably a bad idea and definitely politically motivated(I'll leave out my thoughts there). However, the Global vaccine effort is not lacking for funding or effort. Currently 6 vaccines have either completed or are in phase 1 trials. Of note, Moderna's mRNA vaccine is heavily funded by the NIH. The following link does an excellent job laying out the road map:   [https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2020/04/23/a-close-look-at-the-frontrunning-coronavirus-vaccines-as-of-april-23](https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2020/04/23/a-close-look-at-the-frontrunning-coronavirus-vaccines-as-of-april-23)   This source has an excellent presentation of the time-line for the tops candidates:   [https://www.biocentury.com/article/305091](https://www.biocentury.com/article/305091)   Final note: As a whole, missteps have been made that could have prevented or reduced impacts but the scientific effort to bring treatments and vaccines to bear against Covid-19 is truly astonishing. These things take time but they are moving faster than any other pharmaceutical effort in our history.
> We are scheduled to reopen tomorrow even though our infection rate has only plateaued,      yes, that was the plan. slow the rate. flatten the curve. We did that. Its not good optics to move to goalposts now and say 'not until we we do better'
Germany has tested less than 3 million of is 83 million residents.  That's like 3%  Never before have we approached a virus like this by shutting everything down.   People are going to get sick. People are going to die. Tens of thousands of people die every year in car accidents, yet we take the risk. Generally, at least ten people die *every day* by drowning, yet we still have swimming pools and open lakes and oceans to swimming.   Look at the prison populations where 96%+ of this infected are totally asymptomatic. Look at the data from cruise ships where the VAST MAJORITY of those in an enclosed environment did not get that sick or die.   If the UCLA and Stanford studies are correct, then this has about a .2% mortality rate, and even then its mostly the elderly and those with comorbitiies.   I'm not saying to go stand in traffic, but when your time is up, your time is up. if you live in fear, then you are really not living at all.
Cuomo said today that 66% of those hospitalized were staying at home in isolation. We will never be able to test everyone if I get tested and by the time I get negative results back I could be positive at that point. If I get a fast test back how long is the expectation that I have to take another one?
Why should we believe the pessimistic numbers over the more optimistic numbers?   The data is trending towards a more optimistic outlook. I don’t agree its cherry picking to pick 3 antibody studies conducted in April. It’s the latest data we have. Compared to all the shitty models which are based more on faulty assumptions than actual data, these antibody tests are much more useful, even if they are completely perfect.
Your problem is that you are listening to the people that the TV media decides to show you, instead of doing your own research.  Also, the large majority of hospitalized cases have come from people that have been sheltering in place. The lockdown has been very ineffective.  It’s also why you are so scared.
We need to open up everything. If you are part of the at risk population then take the necessary precautions for you. Look at The NY Times story today about 66% of people infected by the virus in NY contracted it while staying indoors. Also I can’t wait for everyone to get sick that has been inside for the last month since they have not been exposing their immune system on a daily basis. Your body fights multiple things a day and not exposing your immune system to that is not good.
Phase 1 means my open concept office with 30+ people and one small break room all get to return to work Monday morning...
Agree with this.  I don't honestly think there is denial.  It's the hard reality that each outcome has some pretty severe tradeoffs.  Yes, I'm sure the state would love to be in a better situation with testing and tracing.  I honestly think we'll get there soon.  But further, there is ample evidence (not head in sand, real evidence) that the virus doesn't transmit well outside and in warmer weather.  Cuomo (NY) is reporting that a lot of their recent cases (\~80%) are actually people quarantining and staying mostly inside.  There is a very good chance that getting outside more and getting sun is actually a great help in boosting immune systems, and one of the best things we could be doing now.  Yes, the fall beckons and it will likely resurge then, but trying to stay in with summer approaching is probably the worst prescription for staying healthy right now.
>Yeah increased testing and contact tracing is obviously ideal. It’s not happening for whatever reason.  It's not happening because our political discussion is being fueled by irrational emotions rather than cold, hard science.   > Epidemiologists and people who understand it way better than any of us on Reddit were involved  Yes, and even the epidemiologists in the Trump administration are telling us not to open up. That's the absurdity of the situation. They provided guidelines. No state, including ours, has met those guidelines. They are now telling us not to open up yet because we failed to meet the guidelines, but we are doing it anyway, against advice of Fauci and Brix, the two highest level experts in the Trump admin. It's just that those experts are being drowned out by Trump, thus leading to an information fog where people are confused.
An illustration of the testing gap, using current data from The Atlantic's COVID tracking site (https://covidtracking.com/api).  Going by total tests performed,   Rank #1: NY    Tests performed: 1,028,899    Population: 19.45m    Test rate: 5.3%   Rank #16: NC    Tests performed: 164,482   Population: 10.49m    Test rate: 1.6%    Charlotte metro has about 2.5 million people (I've seen anywhere from 2.4m to 2.6m as figures), so if every single test was done in Mecklenburg, you'd get to 6.5% of Meck being tested. That'd be a decent conversion rate, but isn't reflective of reality.   Odds are we're doing more testing in Mecklenburg and around Raleigh than we are out in Asheville or in the outer banks, just due to the relative population sizes. A county-by-county testing breakdown would be interesting to review.
Of course, we are ramping up but not nearly as much as we need to. And, of course, the more the infection spreads, the more testing is required. So, it's a bit of race.
I would agree that vaccine development is the most promising response to this pandemic and our best hope. I also concur that it is the response that has been least botched for political reasons. I am also not ruling out a miracle that delivers an early vaccine that saves the day.  But I think there is still a lot of risk involved. The vast majority of vaccines fail and those that succeed take time to test and produce. Whether or not vaccines will arrive in time to mitigate catastrophic economic damage is an open question.
But we haven't flatten the curve yet. There is no curve downward yet. There is just a plateau. And we are not moving goalposts. We are failing to meet the goalposts already set by the Trump admin's experts.
Your statistics are inaccurate. Yes, the true mortality could be substantially less because of asymptomatic infections, maybe somewhere between .5 and 1%. That would present a death rate 5 to 10X higher than the flu, which is .1%.  Also, you ignore another aspect, which is that this is a novel virus where the population has no immunity. So, that means, many more people will get the covid in a short period of time, relative to the flu.  Right now, covid is the leading cause of death in the US, and the pandemic is just getting started. Less than 1% of population has been infected. Without social distancing, that percentage will go to at least 60%. So, if covid is the leading cause of death now at 1% infection, can you imagine what life is going to be like as it spreads through 60% of the population?  Your perceptions are based on false intuitions, not on what the science is actually projecting.
That's a misleading statistics on many levels. Of course, since the government is ordering everyone to shelter at home, then of course, most people are complying. This segment makes up a large part of the population. Another factor is elderly people are far more likely to be hospitalized and, of course, they are less likely to be out and about working. So, it stands to reason, elderly will make up more of the hospitalizations, whereas younger people may be spreading the disease far more, just not end up in the hospital. However, they are the ones spreading it the most. , And the elderly staying at home can still get the virus from visitors or by shopping, since people don't have proper PPE.   One thing is true from studies in Wuhan, the most common means of transmission is within household from one family member or resident to another. That is far more common than in the grocery store.   What they did in Wuhan was remove people from their homes and stick them in isolated facility with other sick people, thus protecting their family and household. While we wouldn't want to force people to do that, it would be beneficial to provide that option to people so that they can avoid infecting their family. That is a another significant component missing from our response.   Lastly, if shelter-at-home restrictions are lifted, we'll obviously see the distribution change. If everyone is out and about, then the next statistic will say 90% of those hospitalized were out and about. :)  To answer you next question, experts are saying people need to be tested every two weeks to reach a point where we could effectively contain the virus while restarting the economy fully. Yes, it's a big challenge but not as big as losing trillions of dollars in economic losses.
Actually, I get most of my info reading newspapers and journals, not TV. I am also not scared at all. I'm one of the privileged few working from home, making a good living, enjoying gardening. My life has barely changed, and I'll continue working from home, regardless of the lockdown status.   I am more worried about all the restaurant servers and other low-paid  workers who will either become homeless for lack of employment or will be forced to put their lives at risk to make crappy wage that they can barely subsist on.   I'm actually more worried about the economy than the virus. Ultimately, I predict we will continue to shut down as we get hit with more waves, and that is going to cause catastrophic damage and further political polarization.   That is the part people don't understand. They are up against a force of nature, like climate change. Even if we open up, when virus spreads, it will also spread fear, causing severe economic contraction, regardless of government restrictions.   The only way out is testing and tracing, a small price to pay relative to the trillions in economic losses.
I agree we need to open up everything, but unfortunately, I don't think you are going to get your wish. We will be forced to lock down again and again and suffer more economic pain because of our lack of testing and tracing. That is my point.  Once bodies start piling up on hallways and closets, they will lock down again. It's going to happen. We are in a lose-lose situation.  The only way out of that situation is more testing and tracing.
Yep, next week for me also. Literally nothing changed for office workers, Cooper still suggests work from home. They're just using it as an excuse to get back in.
That sucks and is a bad call
Can we listen to epidemiologists other than Fauci and Birx who are baby boomers past their time? Yes, they do exist, some of them are even from prestigious universities, and not all of them are in favor of the lockdown measures implemented.  Lets give Gen X and Millennials a voice.
It’s a race that we’re getting our asses handed to us in.   The way I see it was there are 3 defensive tactics. Tactic A is a vaccine. B is testing, treatment, and tracing. C is social distancing. I look at in reverse: C is for buying time if B isn’t available until it becomes available. Then B is for until A is available.   We did C, somehow still got outpaced and hit economic impact thresholds (which are very real, C is certainly a trade off and probably the highest cost of the 3 tactics) before we could get to B, and now we could have to pay an even higher price which comes from playing absolutely no defense and just hoping this doesn’t backfire.
Flattening the curve means not overwhelming the hospital system and spreading out the same number of cases over a long period of time. It never meant that we needed to see any decrease. Remember, the whole point was to prevent “exponential growth”.    “By flattening the curve, you’re essentially trying to challenge the health care system with the same number of cases but spread out over a longer period of time,” explained Jeanne Marrazzo, M.D.  https://www.uab.edu/coronavirus/resources/learn-more-about-covid-19
No, your stats are inaccurate. The antibody studies are saying between 0.1 and 0.2 %, which is the same or 2 times the flu.   A Stanford medical professor backs this up in this video:  https://www.hoover.org/research/fight-against-covid-19-update-dr-jay-bhattacharya  I did the calculations for the LA and Miami studies and results are consistent with the Santa Clara study.   LA: https://reason.com/2020/04/20/l-a-county-antibody-tests-suggest-the-fatality-rate-for-covid-19-is-much-lower-than-people-feared/  Between 0.1 and 0.2% fatality rate.  Miami: https://reason.com/2020/04/26/miami-dade-antibody-tests-suggests-covid-19-infections-exceed-confirmed-cases-by-a-factor-of-16/  0.2% fatality rate
Bodies aren’t gonna start piling in hallways and closets.  RemindMe! 4 months
He might not be able to use the phone when he's in the hospital.
Scientists are trained to look objectively at the facts not let their age demographic cloud their judgment. They are not making value judgments weighing the economy vs. lives. That is not their job. They are just telling us what will happen if we fail to control the virus. For the most part, there is general consensus that if we don't test enough and don't contact trace, the infection will grow exponentially, which will negatively impact our health and our economy.
> C is certainly a trade off and probably the highest cost of the 3 tactics)  Exactly, which is why our response is completely irrational. We would rather continue sacrificing trillions in economic losses rather than scale up testing and tracing to the necessary levels. If other countries can do, we can do it.
>It never meant that we needed to see any decrease.  That's absurd. Without a decrease, there is no curve!   It is also very difficult to maintain a plateau. The numbers tend to get pulled up or down in response to our actions. In the real world, an epidemic consists of multiples waves. So, even when numbers go down, we have to look ahead a flattening the next curve. And remember that until we reach herd immunity or a vaccine,  the natural progression is exponential growth. If we are barely plateauing now, reducing social distancing will simply cause the numbers to increase and thus the curve will be much further out and higher in the graph.
Please actually provide a scientific retort instead of cowardly downvoting. Prove to me that I’m wrong. Thanks.
I am aware of that study but there are several problems. One is that antibody tests have a high false positive rate, mainly because they often show a positive for other coronaviruses that cause the common cold. So, the stats inflate the number of people who were supposedly infected when in fact, they were never infected with COVID-19. Also, each population has different demographic and age biases. There have been antibody tests like that done around the world in different locations and they each show quite different results on the IFR.  Another problem is that these studies don't always capture all the deaths from COVID. Some number of people have died from COVID never having been confirmed and tested for COVID. So, the study is not wrong. It describes accurately the statistics in that area given the limitations of their methods. But there are dozens of these studies, each with different results. You can't cherry pick the one study that was significantly more optimistic than the others.

It depends on our actions, of course. I don't think tomorrows loosening is significant enough to trigger that, but if we continue loosening without a real decline in cases, then yes that will absolutely happen. There is no reason to think Charlotte is any different than NYC, Madrid, Wuhan. The same thing that happened in these places will happen here unless we are constantly fighting the virus.
I’m not cherry picking. I posted three studies (Santa Clara, LA, Miami).
Ok man. I’ll check in with you in 4 months.
You are cherry picking three studies! In NY, the IFR was .75% and the Princess cruise ship .6%. This [article](https://www.propublica.org/article/what-antibody-studies-can-tell-you-and-more-importantly-what-they-cant) walks through some of the caveats of these studies. Here's a good quote that pretty much sums up the issue:  “If it’s five times deadlier than the seasonal flu, and three times as many people are going to get it, that means we’re going to get 15 times as many deaths. And 15 times 30,000, which is the middle-of-the-road kind of a seasonal flu year, that’s 450,000 deaths — about half a million deaths — that’s a pretty big, scary number, I think.”  There are still a lot of unknowns and room for better estimates but 450k seems like a plausible number of where we are headed, considering we are already at 76k today after 6-8 weeks of unsustainable lockdown.
Why should we believe the pessimistic assumptions over the more optimistic numbers?   The data is trending towards a more optimistic outlook. I don’t agree its cherry picking to cite 3 antibody studies conducted in April. It’s the latest data we have. Compared to all the shitty models which are based more on faulty assumptions than actual data, these antibody tests are much more useful, even if they are not completely perfect.
People tend to pick out the news (and studies) that fit their hopes or expectations. If you want to be more objective, you'd want to look broadly across all the studies. If it helps you  to feel better emotionally to look at certain studies and not others, then that's fine for you, but we  wouldn't want to make policy discussions based on that. Public policy is to a large extent about mitigating risk, not being optimistic or pessimistic. And again, this is not about  opening the economy vs. lives. It's about investing the appropriate amount money into testing and tracing. The reason why we are in this costly mess to begin with is because people didn't take this risk seriously. Why continue that naive optimism when the costs could be even greater?  Lastly, I think you misunderstand the way models work. They are largely based on assumptions about how people will behave. Early models were based on the assumption of no social distancing before orders took effect, as a warning to people. Now, that people are social distancing, the assumptions change. But if they relax social distancing over the next 1-2 months, then the models will again change.   Also, it sounds like you are arguing models vs. antibody tests, as if they were in competition. That's absurd. Of course, antibody tests are very important and we hope to make them better and better inform our models. Both are critical tools in predicting.
As an economics major, I detest models in general as they are overly relied upon and are unreliable. The failure of Keynesian economics, which relies heavily on models, is an example.    I’m not emotional about this. I’m following the science and logic. Its irresponsible to assume how I came to my conclusions.   I was swayed by the arguments from Stanford epidemiologist John Ioannidis in March that we were making high stakes decisions without reliable data.   https://www.statnews.com/2020/03/17/a-fiasco-in-the-making-as-the-coronavirus-pandemic-takes-hold-we-are-making-decisions-without-reliable-data/  And he loves models. But he says there are valued too highly.   “I love models,” he adds. “I do a lot of mathematical modeling myself. But I think we need to recognize that they’re very, very low in terms of how much weight we can place on them and how much we can trust them. . . . They can give you a very first kind of mathematical justification to a gut feeling, but beyond that point, depending on models for evidence, I think it’s a very bad recipe.”  https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-bearer-of-good-coronavirus-news-11587746176  And I disagree with your prescriptions based on the data. We underreacted in February and now, we’re overreacting. The worst of both worlds.
It's interesting how people are so stuck in binary view of this problem. The issue is not whether we are under or overreacting but whether we are reacting smartly and using our resources wisely.   I read that Ioannidis article when it came out. I don't actually disagree with most in the article other than his lack of offering any constructive solutions.  I agree that we are making costly, highly consequential economic decisions based on poor evidence. But the solution is to get better evidence, not bury your head in the sand, assuming everything is going to be fine. After all, we are still early in this pandemic of a novel virus, and so, we still need better data.  Also, no one is saying we should depend on models for evidence. That is an absurd statement. Models are theories that we extract from evidence and use to predict the unknown. It's basic inductive reasoning. The sun has risen everyday for my lifetime. Therefore, it's logical for me to come up with a model that says it will rise tomorrow. The model is not the evidence. It's the formulated theory we extract from evidence, often described mathematically. And if one day, the sun doesn't rise, well, then, we update our models. But inductive reasoning is the basis for much of science. So, saying you don't like models is like saying you don't like inductive reasoning or evidence-based science. Good luck with that!  Also, Ioannidis is a clinical epidemiologist rather than one who specializes in public health. It's sort of the difference between someone who specializes in personal finance vs. an economist. I wouldn't look to a personal financial advisor for wisdom on the economy.  The whole point of my post was that we should be investing in betters ways of slowing down the virus that don't evolve such high levels of economic harm.   Ioannidis doesn't address that question. He is just  saying that our evidence is weak to be making such big decisions. Ok, but there is still risk that the virus could kill a lot of people, way more than the flu. So, we need better evidence. And that is one of the areas where we should be investing heavily, in antibody studies.   There is plenty of growing evidence that the fatality rate is much higher than the flu that has come out since that article was written. Ioannidis' views are at the extreme end of the spectrum in terms of not taking the virus as seriously, but I can't refute the lack of evidence either. All I can say we face great risks and need more evidence.

COVID-19 unemployment running out
I’m not sure if this is the right sub for this question so feel free to cross post or let me know where to redirect this question. I was laid off on 3/16 due to rona and have about 5 more weeks of regular unemployment pay left. I’m wondering if I will continue to receive the extra $600 each week after my “regular” unemployment money runs out. I know the extra $600 a week payments stop after July 31...at least I think they do. Honestly I’m so confused and it’s impossible to get clear answers through DES directly. Any insight on NC unemployment payments is greatly appreciated. Thank u and I hope everyone is staying safe out there.
the CARES act adds 13 weeks of unemployment payment after the states payments end.
Ah I see, thank you for this info! So do we need to reapply for unemployment or is it just automatically processed to our accounts like how it has been?
I believe it's automatic. From my understanding you will continue to receive gov assistance past when traditional unemployment benefits would run out.   https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.forbes.com/sites/shaharziv/2020/05/06/new-proposal-would-extend-600-unemployment-benefit-indefinitely-until-coronavirus-crisis-ends/amp/
Thanks for the article link! I have all my answers now :)
Thanks for asking these questions; I came on here to ask the exact same thing. This is helpful info!

Amid Covid-19, anxiety and depression risks grow

That part about the modeling being used incorrectly is...concerning.
The office is getting very full, very fast.  &#x200B;  I am literally the only person who wears a mask when I leave my desk and walk anywhere else. Office of about 60 people.   &#x200B;  It's terrifying.
Better start giving me 2k a month. My well being and liquor cabinet depend on it.
The UPenn website said at the top of the model:   "COVID-19 Hospital Impact Model for Epidemics (CHIME)  **Notice**: *There is a high degree of uncertainty about the details of COVID-19 infection, transmission, and the effectiveness of social distancing measures.* *Long-term projections made using this simplified model of outbreak progression should be treated with extreme caution."*  Unfortunately reporters neglected to ask questions a month+ ago when they started talking about this model. I am happy to wear a mask and social distance, but am looking forward to the gradual reopening of businesses and services.
I think everyone who has expressed skepticism about the models presented deserves an apology for being ridiculed on this sub.  Those people actually thought critically.
This has been my biggest concern from the start. I applaud the initiative at the onset of the crisis to pivot a response based upon all the information that we have available and at that time the CHIME model had substantial rigor and sound science.   With forecasting you need to replace early assumptions with facts as they become available and CHIME is an equation built upon assumptions. With that said, I don't see the proper application of modeling resulting in a major change in policy tact like an early end to SIP. But, living under the assumption that we were going to see thousands of people in hospital beds here in Charlotte by mid May did anyone's mental health any favors.
You probably already had it and don’t even know.
Sarcasm going right over their heads.
I think the problem is with how the models were being used by officials specifically Cuomo. I work with models as a hobby and in my job.  The hardest part when you make a model for someone is explaining all the assumptions, how things might change and etc.  TV has made us think that “models” are some magic cure. They are just really numbers on paper trying to simulate real life.
I'll be the first to admit I was completely terrified we were going to be like NYC. I closed my business a week before the shelter in place orders, even though it is classified as essential. I still wear a mask, I still only leave my house for food once a week, I still am not seeing friends.  But this is actually absurd, that the county health officials are using models improperly and pushing back on the manner which they are prescribed to be used *by the people who invented the model.* At this point I'm wondering how they justify their position in our city given the complete ignorance they are demonstrating in this regard, when they are literally the only people that can advise the county/city on whether or not we are going to be in a public health crisis. Shame on them for their arrogance.  I'm still going to wear a mask and such, but I'm done pretending like we are going to see an apocalypse here.
I literally made a throwaway to comment on covid because I figured my main would get ridiculed.   The sad part is even Jeff Jackson, whom I generally like, was sharing all of this wildly inappropriate data. He posted about that Duke study that estimated 250,000 cases in NC if we kept the stay-at-home order in place until June 1st, and 750,000 if we lifted it april 30th. When he posted about that we would have had to more than triple our daily cases record for 2+ months after we had already started to level off.   This whole issue has become so politically charged you either think everyone will die, or you’re a Trump supporter/nazi.   It’s just an indicator of how much both parties have worked to destroy any conversation in this country. You either agree with the politicians whose letter next to their name matches how you normally vote, or you’re retarded.
I won’t be holding my breath waiting for that apology.
Yep - I know for certain that I'm not smart enough to develop models nor update them. I do have the ability to question why things aren't peer reviewed or sanity checked when novices are updating the inputs!
>	I’m still going to wear a mask and such, but I’m done pretending like we are going to see an apocalypse here.  This is exactly what I think is the most reasonable approach.  Some people think the whole thing is overblown and some people think we should be locked inside until a vaccine is used nationwide.
>the county health officials are using models improperly  its concerning as you said....but until we know what "properly" even is, I wouldn't assume that using it "properly" would show things are less alarming. There seems to be a direct mapping right now of social distancing to curve flattening which is allowing our hospitals to have enough resources. Why change the approach right now?  Not to mention the numbers literally only speak to people who went to the dr. or hospital.
> but I'm done pretending like we are going to see an apocalypse here.  A lot of us never started.
I’m glad to see many here are starting to wake up, I’ve been pushing against this since the beginning and always got slammed for ‘not caring’.  I’ve always been for flattening the curve though.  It’s not really about the virus. It’s about seeing what the government can get away with.
When those conservatives were the first to protest is when they really messed up.  They should have included thousands from the hospitality and other related industries too and make it non partisan.  Having it be a conservative movement is what hurt the movement to begin with.
I think the issue there is that there's not going to be a cure. There's no cure for the common cold, flu, or any other virus. Viruses are not curable and people keep talking and hoping for a cure.  A vaccine is still like 8 months away, if the process wasn't disrupted by the virus itself aka manufacturers closing or supply lines cutoff etc., and I'm not sure how people who are still in that bucket of 'fear leaving the house' will mentally get past it.
No matter what the local or state government says, there are millions of people that are refusing to go back to business as usual until we are clearly out of the woods. I don't know what the solution is but it's not preventing people from going to parks, and I'm pretty sure closing schools is not necessary. Again, I'm an idiot, so don't listen to me. But if we aren't approaching any sort of overwhelm, if the curve is flat enough to handle an uptick in cases...well...what are we doing here, exactly?
> Why change the approach right now?  20% of NC is unemployed.  I understand the fear. No one wants to get sick and no one wants to die. When this broke no one had any good data and all we saw was a Chinese lockdown and Italy's healthcare system overwhelmed.   Now, we have almost two or more months worth of data and news is starting to look better and better for most people. In enclosed environments like cruise ships and prisons, the infection rates show to be really high, but the vast majority are asympto matic and the death rate is on par with the flu. Because we are so connected as a nation, some places that were hit bad made it seem like this was terrible everywhere, but that does not appear to be the case. In other words, as our data set has increased and we've learned more about it, it becomes clearer that this isn't the black plague of of the 14th century despite initial projections of millions of people dying in the US. Nationwide we have't hit 100K and across the world we are only at 1/4 million deaths. think about that...250K dead out of a population of **7 billion** people. It's not the apocalypse.   However, we ARE directly affecting the livelihoods and health of millions of people as we continue to halt our way of life. Millions and millions are going to negatively affected not by the virus, but by the actions we've taken based on the modeling and projections of the "experts" who said this was the only way to prevent massive loss of life and having our healthcare system look like Italy's...which it isn't and the two are not even slightly comparable.
We’re being careful not to overwhelm a system because essentially all the numbers are lagging.  I’ve been saying it but people went from Covid isn’t a big deal to we can’t lose a single life. I’m sorry but there is a global pandemic and people will die.
You make a sensible and respectful counter point...and are obviously concerned about others. You're a good human...for real.
It's not terrible everywhere and the numbers are lower because of the social distancing efforts that were implemented. The effectiveness of distancing does not negate the need for distancing. The places that did nothing suffered heavily for it. How many people must die from something that we can greatly mitigate with proper testing and tracing protocol? Do you have a number that's acceptable for loss of life? This could have been prevented, and it wasn't, so now we have to deal with this new reality until the feds get their shit together with regards to testing and PPE. I'm not optimistic they ever will, and thousands of people will die needlessly.
Yes, too many people unfortunately are way too casual about this. There's a not-so-happy medium that we need to reach. I don't think we get there until there is a second or third wave of massive lives lost to prove that out. It needs to get far beyond lives lost in the northeast and needs to reach catastrophic numbers elsewhere.
Focusing on COVID-19 at the expense of everything else is myopic.  People are hesitant to go to the hospital for heart attacks and strokes.    Here is a BBC podcast that talks about some of the other aspects to consider.  You can’t put a price on a human life, but that doesn’t mean we should save lives from one disease at the expense of losing lives from other things.  https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000htrs
I’m confused, what’s your point?
My point is people won't be taking this seriously until the number of fatalities locally is much more significant. Thousands of fatalities in NY, but only a small number here in Charlotte so people are waving their flags and ignoring it.
I mean people are taking it pretty seriously here?
Yes, I really meant across the country and not so much Charlotte (in spite of me specifically saying Charlotte above and writing in the Charlotte sub - this shit is getting to me as well).

Front line medical teams what protocols are you using for covid-19 now?

COVID-19 Antibody tests?
Has anyone had one?  If so, where did you get it?  How much did it cost? Thanks!
Its at Labcorp for 10 dollars but it will come up as positive for previous kinds of corona viruses too so not sure how reliable that is.
I got one from Novant Health. It was covered by my insurance, so nothing to me.  I tested negative even though I had COVID.
Labcorp $10. Signup on there website. FYI antibody testing are not conclusive at all.
I had blood drawn for a different reason and they did the antibody test at the same time. It was covered by insurance.  ETA Quest was the lab my doctor's office used.
Bettermed South Blvd has a tent.  Book an appt online and drive up.  Get results 20 min later.  No cost if you have insurance.
A friend of mine works at an atrium facility and they are testing some of the workers. I would like to know about this also. I believe a lot of people have already had this with no symptoms.
For those who have gone to Labcorp, what was the experience like? In the past when I've gotten blood work done at Labcorp it was a ton of people packed into a tiny room. I assume they are taking precautions like everyone else these days, but curious nonetheless.
So are you immune?
They may have had corona virus, which is the family, but probably not the covid19 version. For example, they may have a ford, but not everyone has a Shelby Ford Mustang.
I know StarMed on Freedom is offering them. I believe around $80.
No, I was negative.
I really love the logic of how this thing is everywhere when it supports the lockdown narrative but nowhere when it doesn't.
StarMed on Freedom charges $50.
I’m confused by what you’re saying
But you have to pay for the virtual visit as well, which is $30

More COVID-19 Cases in the past 4 days(387) than in the preceeding week(334) in Mecklenburg Co. With a one day(16th) peak of 130 cases.

Expected.  Less testing restrictions and more tests are available.
Per the NCDHHS website, our percent of positive tests out of total tests is showing a downward trend:  [https://covid19.ncdhhs.gov/dashboard](https://covid19.ncdhhs.gov/dashboard) (scroll down for the graph)
Guys. I barely passed statistics.
Why would you post graphs with no data source? Any mention of the rate of testing increases and the rate of positive tests?
Not sure where you’re getting the data from but I saw an increase of 123 cases on the 17th and 65 new cases on the 16th?
All this opening up too early is going to cause us to stay closed longer
Only gonna get worse.. too many people not taking it seriously.
Agreed.  I was trying to find some stats on how many tests were administered at least weekly, but couldn't find anything.
Great username!!
Percent positive is such a dumb metric. As the number of tests increases, the number of positives is going to increase AND the percent positive is going to decrease.   I mean if we had enough tests, we could test EVERYBODY and boy would the percent positive be low!  I have no idea why decision makers even look at it.
That's why I summarized the findings in the title.
Yeah this post as it is now is somewhere between unhelpful and misleading.
The number of cases is reported daily. If you can't seem to find those figures, [here ya go](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EcOG8RMS6gmkZ2tCG1MSdqiiwtKpwXEumQjzTEMnhTo/edit?usp=drivesdk).   No I'm not tracking the rate of testing. These are numbers that I track, sure there can always be more context. Feel free to create a better graph and share it. But the statement in the title is true, no amount of context will change that.
NCDHHS
What metric should we be using to justify opening?
My family is still sheltering in... my husband had to return to the office today but the company is pretty proactive in taking extra measures... people are working every other office, mandatory masks, hand sanitizer on every desk, temp check anytime you enter the building.. any hint of a spike they say they will close again.. they were closed before the state (March 10th)
Don't see why this is getting down votes. I go out to the store every five it six days and people are getting complacent. Fewer mask wearing folks every time I go out.  This is how people get sick. The stats don't lie.
Ok Bonnie bear
They're really not, or they're too worried about the economy.  What people don't seem to understand is you can't have much of an economy if everyone's freakin dead! ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
> tests **can be** up to 43%  >real numbers **are** roughly twice  No reason to assume the worst. It's a fact that there are plenty of hospital beds available right now, and per the DHHS website NC has 30+ days of every PPE except for gowns, and 250+ of everything except gowns and N95 masks. The point of the quarantine was to allow hospitals to gather supplies, free up beds, and buy time, which it did.
Agree. I care more about the percentage of positive cases than the total number.  The total number only tells a small piece of the story.
Yeah, the citizen app shows a strong increase in number of tests which would make sense.  https://i.imgur.com/nQ7PPBE.jpg
7% positive for the day, compared to 17% per day a month ago.  Shows a downward trend at least... not going to hit zero for quite awhile. These are daily counts- not cumulative.
The total tests they refer to are for that specific day.  So it's the total positive for that day compared to the total tests done on that same day.  Not total tests altogether.   Quote from the website:    "This ensures that the positive and total tests were conducted on the same day to calculate a more accurate daily percent positive. "
Are you using the lunar calendar?
Whats misleading?
Gotcha. The mecklenburg county twitter account has slightly different information. I wonder what the reporting difference is. My guess would just be timing most likely. The difference is small enough to be insignificant overall, was just curious though
The sequence to open in phases was based off different factors, such as infection rate, which isn’t slowing.
I am not sure either.  Stupid people do stupid things,  I guess.  Thanks for your support  😀
Whatever.  You must be one of them.  I don't really care if you think I'm wrong or not.  Time will tell.   We haven't gotten through it yet and it's too soon to open.. if you look at the facts and what actual science and doctors say.. its too soon.  Think what you want.   I don't care.  Just hope you don't unknowingly give it to someone you care about.   Peace.
*Exhibit A has entered the chat*, I see.
The mortality rate for this virus is below 1%. If literally every person on earth contracted it, the vast majority of people would survive.
Exactly.  Thanks!
It really depends on the populations being tested, if we have less testing it's probably being used for those with the highest risk/worst conditions, without controlling for the tested population percentage positive doesn't mean much.
Technically, I get my numbers from the Citizen app that vlaims to get its numbers from NCDHHS. Perhaps There's some kind of disconnect between those two, but I'm just plugging what they report daily.
Exactly, what should we be looking at? It's clear this disease is not going to go away anytime soon.
Y’all just stay inside locked down for the rest of your life. Problem solved.
I’m not sure I understand your question
Just until this shit is over with. Giving it a year, tops. Hardly the rest of my life (here's hoping).  And you do realize that you can still go outside and still be cautious from six feet away, right?
You stated that all this opening up early will keep us closed longer. The infection rate of the virus hasn't changed, the test results have shown a decline in positive tests per number of tests given, so I'm curious what factor we should be looking at before beginning to reopen.
Tell that to all of the small business owners all over Charlotte and rest of the state. It’s all good though. None of this will effect you. The economy will be fine if we keep this up for a year.
That unemployment check is pretty sweet ain't it?
A decrease in infection rate for one.  Perhaps I’m mis informed, but is the topic headline not saying there is more cases? Which is why I’m confused
You better keep that same energy and fight for a universal basic income so this wouldn't be a problem.  But ew communist money or something, right?
I'm an "essential" worker that'd wish y'all stay the fuck home so you don't get anyone else sick and we can get through this shit faster.
There are more reported positive cases, however there's also been an increase in the number of tests performed and availability for tests have increased. Before last week, only those who were considered 'high risk' for the virus were able to get the test, yeilding a larger percentage of tests returning a positive. Now that testing is greater and more widely available, we're seeing that the number of positive test results per tests given to be on a decline, even with an increase in total number of positive cases.   To me, the infection rate is how contagious something is, and unless the virus mutated or we all get some immunity to it, that won't change so it's not a good metric. If we're seeing that with testing everyone that the number of active positive cases are much lower than first perceived, we should not be sent into another lockdown.
Can you really not see how this effects the way you view this issue? It must be nice having a career that isn't put in jeopardy by the lockdown.
lol yes everyone stay inside 18 months and wait for a vaccine!!  Meck hospitals are overrun!!!!
I'm an *"essential"* worker with reduced hours and pay- and I can still get axed at any time. The only reason I have a job is so my company can still make a profit. They don't give a shit about the health of their workers beyond the bare minimum; it's all about the money.   Please tell me what is nice about any of that.   And the only reason I'm not sick now, is that my coworkers and I are doing what we need to do (edit: in spite of the circumstance of being collateral damage for capitalism).   Is there a reason you can't?

North Carolina leads the nation in COVID-19 outbreaks at meatpacking plants - Enlace Latino

The hispanic community is going to suffer greatly from this crisis, especially working-class who or may not have proper documentation. This isn't only limited to meatpacking facility, but increasingly construction sites as well. As contact tracing expands, state authorities need to actively communicate that documentation won't be questioned when identifying associates or family members who have been potentially exposed.
i have my bleach, and hydroxychloroquine. i'm good to go
Whoopsy
Absolutely agreed.
Seems pretty bipartisan at this point
You sound like you want a trophy for going to work.
I'd say the biggest problem, as I was just talking with someone right now, is that while there's "radicalization" there simply is no organization. People aren't getting organized. Which is why I say: get into your local org or national org and get organized, somehow anyways...
lol
Tell that to the worm brained protesters with guns posted at government buildings in every state that dares continue stay at home orders.
Forget about it. You can't stop most people from being idiotic. If they want to risk their life to get their nails done they will probably do it because it hasn't hit anyone close to them yet.
Sure. But I don't have to lick their faces.   Contrary to popular belief you can mostly prevent contracting the virus from strangers or these kinds of areas by being careful
You either take the proper precautions or you don't.  Cheers.

North Carolina sees almost 10% increase in total Covid-19 cases in 1 day.

You have to really look at hospitalizations vs the amount of cases.  Of course, cases are going to increase as testing becomes more available.  Also, many people were waiting awhile for results.
10% of tests were positive which is an increase from the 7% we had seen lately, so thats not a good sign.
It can, but if you are near a confirmed case you can get tested before then.
Tests have also been crazy inaccurate. I think the Abbot tests could’ve missed up to 48% of positive cases.
Not necessarily.  In NY the confirmed cases go up, but hospitalizations have decreased.  It’s just a matter of more testing.  Yes, this virus is terrible.  There’s no doubt about that.  I’m from NY.  I have several friends and relatives working in the hospitals up there.  No need to get all worked up over a comment. 🤷‍♀️
FYI........bitching about being downvoted makes folks downvote you.
As testing goes up, reported cases go up. Let's do some basic math to demonstrate what's going on. Imagine a group of 1000 people, 100 of whom have coronavirus. Test 100 of them at random, and you'll have somewhere around 10 positive tests. Test 500 of them at random, and that number will go up to 50 positive tests. The numbers day over day will have risen by a factor of 5. This is a fact that can be seen. Despite the rise in day over day numbers, there was no actual rise in infections. 100 people in that group of 1000 were infected the whole time. Doing more testing made the numbers rise, but there was no actual rise in the number of people infected with coronavirus.
Hospitslizations are flat or declining everywhere in the country. Number of cases do not matter since flattenimg the curve referred ONLY to avoiding overwhelming hospital capacity, not overall cases.
Then downvote away bitches. Doesn't change shit about the post itself.
No, you are seeing mainly a rate of *DETECTION* increasing due to higher testing rates. It does not directly correlate to rate of infections. Yes, the virus continues to spread but we are largely detecting infections that in the past we couldn't because tests were scarce. Before, only really sick people got a test... now, it's far easier and there are more routine tests happening for first responders.  Keep your eye on hospitalizations (because more available testing really doesn't affect that number) and deaths (which are fairly hard to miss due to the dead body it leaves behind) - those metrics are far more comparable week to week than the number of infections.

NCDHHS Reports Highest One-Day Increase of COVID-19 Positive Tests

It was also one of our highest days of test completed - HOWEVER, our percent positive was 10% so it can't just be blamed on the high testing.  A surge was expected with reopening though so I hope it doesn't get much worse that this.
And y'all talking about reopening stuff...
There are any number of reasons why one day can show higher results. We need to see several days worth of data before there's any point in trying to draw conclusions.
In before people come in and say it's because of increased testing, as if that matters
May 22 Wilkes County had over 700 test positive so the increase is prob a result of the Tyson infected workers infecting family Members and others in Wilkes County.  I googled Wilkes County Covid  numbers
[It looked like the positives-to-tests ratio was trending down.](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/testing/individual-states/north-carolina) I would wait for enough data to get a 5 day smoothing before assuming a trend.
lol one of our highest days of completed tests
Well you see, when you test you have a case, when you test you find something wrong. If we didn't test we'd have very few case, but nobody wants to write about that. It's common sense. So we test much more, many many times
Look at that huge spike in the number of tests done on 5/23. This will reduce the ratio which is pretty deceptive.
No, but I certainly don't wish it to get higher.  And to be clear, I am one of the people still staying home and wearing a mask when I do need to go out, so I'm have been and still am taking this very seriously.
We did around 12,600 tests that day (5/22), which is around the same as 5/15. The only other day that was more than that was on 5/20, when we did over 13,000.  Again, our percent positive was high on 5/22 though, so the high number of tests is not the sole explanation for the high number of cases reported.  The data is posted here:  [https://covid19.ncdhhs.gov/dashboard/testing](https://covid19.ncdhhs.gov/dashboard/testing)
 And, you know, when you say “per capita,” there’s many per capitas. It’s, like, per capita relative to what? But you can look at just about any category, and we’re really at the top, meaning positive on a per capita basis, too. They’ve done a great job.
I completely agree, rate of positive tests is far more important. It’s  worth mentioning the amount of tests when reassuring people they can get tested if they need to, not as a statistic related to its spread.
I just checked the link.  Positive tests/new cases:  Friday, May 22nd: 758  Saturday, May 23rd: 1,107  That's a 46% jump in new cases which is far scarier to tell people. Yes, the rate of positive tests is pretty steady around 6-7% but that's a huge increase in actual cases which is why 'total number of tests' is a bit deceiving.  Also, fewer doctor's offices are open on Saturdays... The increase in positive cases usually occurs Mon-Wed.  &#x200B;  This does not bode well.  &#x200B;  Edit: found this graph on the dashboard:    [https://covid19.ncdhhs.gov/dashboard/cases](https://covid19.ncdhhs.gov/dashboard/cases)    it isn't logarithmic, unfortunately, but still worth looking at.
Did we just become best friends????
Fuck me.  I had to look that up, assumed it was SNL or an original joke.
Number of tests performed is also important to show how well we are assessing the spread - low positive numbers are only encouraging if we are testing enough people to get a true assessment of what is going on.
If the % positive is flat then there’s nothing to worry about as far as increasing your fear. These people would have been in the community anyway if the testing wasn’t completed. The more you test the greater the cases
you shouldn't pay too much attention to day over day increases/decreases. They are volatile. Look at the 7 day averages. Those are also up on cases, but NC is doing way more testing than before
Tremendous friends
Another gem: ‘And I tested very positively in another sense, this morning. I tested positively toward negative, right? So I tested perfectly this morning. Meaning I tested negative. ... But that’s a way of saying it: positively toward the negative.’
Yeah I got that from the transcript on the White House’s website.
But you have to wonder why the increase in tests done. Is it because we suspect more positive cases? Is it because they are more available? Are we blanket testing where we test everyone who goes to a doctor’s office or hospital? The ‘total tests’ Metric leads to more questions than answers.
Many beautiful friends, the most beautiful friends you've ever seen. Tremendous
It’s my assumption that tests are more widely available so more people are being tested, period. Early on there were tons of stories of people with symptoms that apparently “weren’t bad enough” to receive a test. Now they’re probably testing everyone with slight symptoms.   At this point it’s uncontrollable. Protect yourself and family as much as you can and stop worrying yourself to death.
It's because more tests are available. They have also loosened the standards for testing so that anybody with symptoms can get it (and maybe some with no symptoms)
Agree, there’s no reason not to be cautious. You won’t find me at a bar/brewery anytime soon.
That’s still a hell of a lot more people that ‘needed’ to be tested. Re your other comment, a 46% increase in cases is more than volatile. I’ve taken statistics courses and I’m still not convinced number of tests is a good metric. Thanks for your insights though.

North Carolina Reports Highest One Day Spike Of COVID-19 Cases : Coronavirus Live Updates : NPR

It’s ok, we’re just following the Swedish model!   Well, except for the universal healthcare, lower obesity, diabetes, and preexisting condition rates.  But hey, Herd Immunity! Except herd immunity is for when there is a vaccine and it’s to protect those who can’t get vaccinated, but that’s ok!
But here’s to phase II
Turns out letting bars and restaurants get packed for memorial day weekend might not be the brightest move during a pandemic.
I’m genuinely confused when people start throwing the term herd immunity around right now like it’s actually a thing. Like ???? Do y’all just like the way it sounds? Because we are NOT going to get herd immunity until there’s a vaccine? Like, that’s what herd immunity needs... to exist?
While I agree with the sentiment, Memorial Day weekend had nothing to do with this spike.   " Cases increased by 1,107 Saturday and tests by 26,385" -  [https://www.newsobserver.com/news/coronavirus/article242954286.html](https://www.newsobserver.com/news/coronavirus/article242954286.html)   26k tests is about 4x as many tests as normal.
with *this* spike.    i'd put money on it being related to our next spike.
Well yes, that's logical that more people congregating likely means more people will get infected.

hello data man, do you have any stats on percent positive? there used to be charts on this in the news and there hasn't been recently
New cases mean nothing since mortality rate is .04%.  Tell us how many are recovering or dying? That’s like saying how many people caught a cold. As for contact tracing, I’d have to be dead before I let that happen. Which won’t because 99.96% recover from this.
The blue numbers on the last chart, friend. If you're referring to the total. I don't have anything currently, I would have conveyed out if I did. Definitely let me know if you find that Intel, though.
[Johns Hopkins gotcha covered.](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/testing/individual-states/north-carolina)
Just look at the NC coronavirus dashboard.  Updated as of today.   [https://covid19.ncdhhs.gov/dashboard/testing](https://covid19.ncdhhs.gov/dashboard/testing)   Peaked 5/22 at 10%, trending downward in the last week.
“New cases mean nothing” ...... uhhh
Based on confirmed cases, it’s 2.5% mortality in Mecklenburg County
Ok how about only 4 additional deaths in the last week.  We held steady at 69 deaths for 5 days.
It takes longer than 5 days for people to show serious problems
Just saying the county had a stable death rate for 5 days.  There are less populated counties in the North with more deaths than Mecklenburg County.
Are you saying we should open up without restrictions because of that or ____?
Yeah they're likely in closer proximity to the country's epicenter. Covid doesn't respect boarders.
North Carolina should have never closed.
Some maybe, most are pretty rural though.
Why?
This is a virus which is rarely fatal and has a recovery rate 99.86 percent.   The mortality rate is approximately 0.03 percent of the total us population and yet we put 40 million people on unemployment through shutdowns and furloughs. Plus take into account the only study has been replicated,  peer reviewed and revised has been the Stanford University study showing approximately the infection rate 54 times higher than reported.   The apocalyptic reporting led to the situation we currently exist.   If there is not a nationwide jump in cases that can be tied back to Memorial Day weekend,  the media and experts have done a huge disservice to our country. I write this as a person who is supposed to be in a high risk group.
It's already killed over 0.03% of the US population(320M*0.0003=96,000)(current death count: 98,875). If you meant 3% then that's 9.6 million people. What is this magically mythical number of people that we should sacrifice so people can work? And what do you think would happen to the economy once a mass amount of people got sick. But no, you're smarter that the professionals. Right?  >If there is not a nationwide jump in cases that can be tied back to Memorial Day weekend, the media and experts have done a huge disservice to our country.  Fox and Trump already did that by underplaying this as no worse than the flu and saying it would magically disappear. News flash, we have a vaccine for the common flu, not SARS-2. They're the news sources you should be angry with because they lied for weeks on end, instead of encouraging preparedness. Wow.  Don't worry a lot of people in high risk groups voted against their own interests and are still to blind to see it.

Covid-19 antibodies


People who test positive after recovering from COVID-19 don’t appear to carry infectious virus
Some good news at least  [https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid19-reinfection-immune-response](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid19-reinfection-immune-response)
What percentage of North Carolina’s population has tested positive? And can they guess how much of population is positive based off of that?
 "don't appear to" and a small sample size in study is all I need to know that this isn't even close to being conclusive.
I remember reading about false positives after recovering, but I think we have a ways to go before this becomes fact.

WHY DO PEOPLE THINK COVID 19 ISNT AN ISSUE ANYMORE
No one seems to be taking Covid 19 Seriously anymore in Charlotte. I had to go to Target today for groceries, and I noticed many people not even wearing masks, so I started counting. Out of the 80 people I counted, 30 were wearing masks. Excluding the 10 employees, less then 30% of people were even wearing masks. I had to ask people to step away from me because they came up and stood right next to me. People are not social distancing. However, Mecklenburg county is hitting record numbers of cases. With the exception of May 26th (I have no idea why) every day has had 500 or more new cases. Yesterday was 750. Compare that to when this order was in effect and it was less then 300 nearly every day consistently. 737 people have died. 737. That's a huge number. That's over SIX TIMES THE NUMBER OF MURDERS IN CHARLOTTE IN 2019. IN 2 MONTHS.  Just because you are tired of being quarantined doesn't mean that this is over. If you aren't taking precautions, then you are responsible in part for those 737 deaths. Please wear a mask and stay home. I am 18 years old. There's a 99% chance I'll be safe if I get it, but why am I the one who cares when other ADULTS don't care. Thank you for reading. Be safe y'all.Edit: North Carolina Cases* not Mecklenburg county cases
Sadly we live in a time where you can pick your own reality. The media is so divided you can find exactly what you believe(right or wrong) which further enforces those feelings.   It is important to maintain open lines of real data, news, and insights from multiple confirmed sources. Though I can tell you anyone who doesn't take this seriously will never do that...
its fatigue, this life-shift strains everyone and folks have become fatigued.  My fiance and I keep reminding ourselves to keep our guards up. I wear my mask everywhere. I'm the only person at work who wears one in the office (when I leave my desk, i got lots of space)
I just checked the data and Mecklenburg county is up to 88 deaths. Maybe the 737 deaths you are referring to is state wide. I’m just trying to make sure we aren’t spreading false data.
232 new cases in Mecklenburg County today.  89 deaths in Meck total.  Total cases of about 3,800.  Are your numbers for cases in N.C.?
As a nurse who takes care of covid patients currently In the ICU I applaud you for caring. So many people right now aren’t caring about others and realizing that social distancing works.
What's your source of number of new Meck Co cases per day? I think you're looking at total NC numbers or something, Meck Co has been mostly less than 100 per day the whole time with a couple exceptions.
Do people realize that our current state is what we were planning on this whole time? Flattening the curve. The number of positive cases are going to keep rising for an extended period of time. The difference is they aren’t rising exponentially and overwhelming the hospitals. From what I’ve heard, hospitals are not in danger of being overwhelmed. We are going to have to live with these cases growing, but yes we should still be smart about wearing masks in public when we can’t avoid being 6ft away from each other, avoiding large crowds, etc.
people feel like it's not a serious issue because the stay-at-home order actually worked and kept deaths and new cases down. They cite the death toll saying it's no worse than any normal flu but that's not taking into account the fact that we've been actively trying to keep the outbreak from spreading and killing people.
The retail company I work for that is about to open to the public had originally instructed us to post and tell people that we will be requiring masks just sent out an email that we MAY NOT talk about masks or tell customers we are requiring them. We can only have a sign up and if they chose to see it and follow it...that’s up to them. It’s unfair to workers who came back to work under the impression that they would be safe by us requiring masks.
Driving through NoDa has been a surreal experience these past couple of days—I mean, parking isn’t so scarce (not that I’ve tried, more of an observation), but, yeah, you’re right, it seems like large amounts of people are acting as if it’s all over and everything’s fine. I’m more concerned now than when this situation first started, since it seems like a lot of folks lack concern. Sure, most people who are out are young, but you never know how many (or few) steps of removal someone is from a vulnerable individual. Plus, essential employees don’t have much of a choice but to be out in the public, and will have presumably have less of a choice as lockdown is further lifted, most likely decreasing prospects of collecting unemployment.
I've definitely been erring on the side of caution. Wearing masks to go do essential shopping, not staying out longer than I need to, I've only visited a few friends once this past weekend and we sat outside spaced apart.  I haven't started venturing back out to restaurants/bars/breweries as that still doesn't seem to be very safe.  I recognize that the perception is this is only dangerous for a small number of people, but we all bare responsibility in helping keep them safe too.  That said, you gotta learn to control what you can control.  You can't control whether people go out, wear masks, etc., but you can control what you do. Find peace in that & keep doing what you're doing.
Outside of my shared concern/outrage, it's terribly interesting just who is wearing masks - demographically speaking.  Of course my experience is anecdotal... but I'm less and less surprised by my eyes.  FOr what it's worth, my demographic is the least likely to wear a mask
honestly, the same thing happened to me at the grocery store. It’s like just because things are opening back up people think it’s all over and they can go back to normal but we didn’t quarantine for weeks for nothing.
This is my theory and person opinion: Fatigue has caused people to lose sight of the reason we social distance. Once the virus became politicized, people seem to have forgotten that humans can't decide when viral transmission. They've lost focus and started to believe that the pandemic is over when we start acting like it's over.  The whole reopen states movement has shifted mindsets from combating a virus to combating the government. These people seem to think the virus is over and the government is what's causing all of this. It's truly sad.  I hate how such a small representation of people in this country have the loudest voices. It's toxic. It's true when they say one bad apple spoils the bunch.
I have to admit I have relaxed on my precautions.
This is so depressing. Why the hell did PUBLIC HEALTH and the potential for DEATH have to become a stupid political issue? It's so fucking irresponsible of Trump and his whole goon squad to be rallying their voter base against wearing masks. It's just a matter of common courtesy, telling your fellow man "we're in this together, I'm protecting you, you're protecting me". Congrats, Trump, you really got us libruls, boy do we look silly with our masks...  Thanks for posting this. I know it seems like you're preaching to the choir, but we all need to stay mad.
The mask part is what gets me, it’s disrespectful to those who have to wear one (grocery store, food industry). I mean things are “open” now, and honestly going and doing “normal” things isn’t the biggest deal IF YOU WEAR A MASK!!!!
Frustrating. This pandemic is a more difficult situation than we've ever had to deal with (and hopefully we never have to deal with anything like this again)  Hopefully we can all work together to overcome this as quickly and safely as possible:  1. Stay safe/reduce the spread (wash hands frequently, socially distance, wear masks) 2. Support the economy (order from local restaurants, shop locally when possible) 3. Take care of ourselves (ensure our mental well being, be a caring community)
Made a post about this the other day.   https://www.reddit.com/r/Charlotte/comments/gr284a/after_months_of_barely_getting_out_of_my_house_i/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf  I feel you brother. Hang in there and do what you are doing.
Exercising your "freedom" to be an absolute ass is the rallying cry of the troglodyte party.
Because people think Phase 1 and Phase 2 means its over ... There is also a president who thinks masks are unnecessary.
A lot of people weren't from the beginning. A ton of people in my work place think it's overinflated and not a big deal. It's frustrating to work under people that make decisions that could unnecessarily risk infection because they personally don't think it's as bad as people think it is.
The idiots really proving this point in the thread.  Remarkable.
I have also noticed less people wearing masks when I went for my biweekly grocery run today. 2 weeks ago like 75%had masks at bjs including the workers, today less than half had masks. I will keep using my masks as I don't want to get sick and I have a premie at home and try to limit my contact with other people as much as possible
I think when the dining room ban was lifted to where some could dine in people thought we can go out to eat & I can’t wear a mask while I eat so why wear one anywhere. If I’m spread out in a restaurant eating and it’s “safe” then I’m spread out at Walmart/Target/the mall/etc why wear a mask there. Cooper lifted the restriction and he’s “official” so it must be safe. If you think about that it kinda makes sense how that is people’s rational.
people are tired of being couped up.  Not excusing the relaxing behavior but people have reached their limit.
I work all over our area. Fort Mill to lancaster to concord and its the same everywhere. Many health conscious people and many many clowns.
It’s a bad situation.  Just protect yourself.  Others are always going to do what they want. If they are right, in 2 weeks we won’t see much change in cases.  If they are wrong, hopefully the spike In cases will inspire people to be more careful in the future.  In 2 weeks, it will be sorted out.
The recent protests are likely going to ignite cases as well. It seems people are gassed from the precautions we took in the initial weeks, and are growing more lax every day. That sucks considering the odds of infection will grow, as we become less vigilant, as time passes.
And would you look at that! Two of the three highest number of positive cases took place yesterday and today:  [https://covid19.ncdhhs.gov/dashboard](https://covid19.ncdhhs.gov/dashboard)
I live in South End and with Sycamore opening back up today along with a lot of the "restaurants" (aka bars that also have food) the crowds and traffic felt like they were completely back to normal pre-rona levels today.  We'll see how these decisions people are making pan out in a couple of weeks.
It’s crazy, I just passed Legion brewing and the place is packed. Absolutely no social distancing inside or outside.
I was just thinking this tonight. Was out on a walk and a bunch of my neighbors were all hanging out in a huge clump. Fifteen people from 3-4 families, kids playing and touching each other, no social distance... It's beyond infuriating.
People just choose to be ignorant and think they’re “above” a virus. I’ve been out of a job for a hot minute because of this but damn am I gunna be hesitant when they call me back to work. I don’t trust other people because most of them are acting like it’s a total joke. STAY HOME UNLESS ITS SOMETHING >>>>ESSENTIAL<<<<
We reopened too soon,  [we're paying because of it,](https://www.endcoronavirus.org/countries) instead of taking the right precautions and lowering deaths like other countries (ie South Korea) we'd rather cry about losing our freedoms. Not sure where this outcry was during 9/11 (3K deaths) and the freedoms we lost with that situation.  I understand where small business owners are coming from, they have not been provided with the correct support from our government. But the amount of anti-intellectualism in this country is insane.
I noticed this too at the arboretum. I just think it’s because people feel like they can move on with their lives since shit is reopening. I expected this to happen. People have no self preservation when they aren’t forced to comply with social distancing rules.
I'll admit, I shopped the other day without a mask. I have a homemade cloth mask, and I'd washed it, and just walked out the house thinking I had it on me, but I left it on the counter.  I felt real bad the entire time, because I've been personally proactive about all this since the beginning. Problem was though....I blended right in with everyone else that was out at the time, cause like you, I witnessed maybe 25% of the people out wearing masks.  People think open = over, when it's really not.
It’s been like this the entire time for me. Every grocery store I go to, less than 30% of people are wearing mask and going down aisles in whatever direction they want.
Thank you for being concerned. It’s real but ppl are taking cues from trump. Many ppl will die as a result.
I actually went out yesterday to Target, and I just walked in nonchalant wasn’t thinking about anything and about 5 minutes after being in the store I was like “oh shit my mask!” And put it on. I’m very forgetful.
The cases are up because the testing is way up.
It’s so funny to me. It’s like since phase 1 opened, people think covid just went away. We still don’t have a cure and many people are dying. I think it’s because the news isn’t reporting it anymore so it doesn’t appear as serious. But it’s been as serious as ever
At the store I work at I'm insisting people wear their masks, and some will go back to their car and get it but most will argue with me. I'm sorry sir but the health of the other customers and employees is more important than you being inconvenienced for 30mins. I know so many and see so many people not taking it seriously anymore either and I just don't understand since cases are rising.
I'm the only one at my job wearing a mask, and I'm in retail. Only one washing my hands periodically. Only one social distancing. Short attention spans and lack of vigilance will be the death of us.
It’s over because rioting and looting is the new trend.
They should but the media is biased and leads them to believe it is no longer a threat. We should be able to trust our news sources but that is not the case anymore which is appalling. News is the first source of information but you have to take the time to dig deep and find the facts and it is a daunting task.  Many have already expressed this but please dig deeper and don't believe that everything you read on the internet is true. I think the onion expressed this best (everything they post is a joke/satire on the news). I beg people to research and ask questions just not to accept what is said by political figures. Medical professionals know more than what is broadcasted by ignorant people.
Probably going to be down voted but it's fine.   It's because covid-19 is only dangerous to a small percent of people. Should the elderly, unhealthy, or people otherwise with high risk factors stay inside? Sure. For everyone else? It's just not that dangerous. Do you know that the average age of death of covid patients is older than the average age of death of all causes? We've stuck our heads in the sand to avoid facts and reason  Our hospitals are stable, that is what matters. For everyone else? We can decide for ourselves how much risk we are willing to take on.  This virus isn't going to go away. We're not going to "beat" covid-19. Might as well accept that fact now and start moving on to a new normal
God I hate these virtue signaling/karma whoring posts. They always say some sort of hyperbolic variation of “NO ONE is taking this seriouslyyy!!” (except for me of course). Then the posts get upvoted like crazy because most people are taking social distancing and PPE at least moderately seriously, but you observe those who are not wearing masks or coughing into their hand at the grocery store and associate that with “no one” taking this pandemic seriously.  Most people I see at grocery stores are wearing masks, the workers are wearing masks, plexiglass windows are up at the registers, grocery carts are being wiped down in between uses, etc. Even if they aren’t wearing masks people are keeping their distance from others from my observation. Wasn’t too long ago that I was shamed for playing golf by myself smh.
People are stupid?
> Please wear a mask and stay home.   bruh how you gonna tell others to stay home when you spent long enough at target to count 80 people in the store
Why didn't you order ahead and do pickup? Why were you wandering around the inside of a building long enough to headcount 80 people? You're part of the problem. Stay at home, do not go near crowds.
It's dangerous that people think masks are protecting them from anything and get false confidence. The virus enters your eyes, and main transmission path is long-residence-time aerosol particles (< 2.5 μm), which are too fine to be blocked, while the minimum-infective-dose is smaller than one aerosol particle.   https://www.researchgate.net/publication/340570735_Masks_Don't_Work_A_review_of_science_relevant_to_COVID-19_social_policy  https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/new-study-questions-the-effectiveness-of-masks-against-sars-cov-2#More-virus-on-outer-mask-surfaces
Because it’s “not real” to them. They haven’t been been, nor has anyone they know been infected yet
It had been 10+ days I went for groceries and I went to Costco and Indian store today. Looks like they forgot what is happening right now. Just not following the distance.
Sadly a lot of people believe it’s a hoax.  That the lockdown was never needed.   As stupid as that is to say out loud when the whole world did it.   They look at it as well I don’t know anyone impacted.
Bc members of our government say its no big deal
This is a free country. Worry about yourself Karen.
Thanks for wearing a mask OP. Most young kids I see when I go get groceries aren't wearing any masks. Unfortunately I think it's cause they don't wanna look "un-cool".
It happens in these long drawn out pandemics. It's like cabin fever. After so long some just turn it of. Or go into denial if a second wave comes its usually bad because people aren't protecting themselves. When the government looks to impose restrictions again. For some it's like being drug back to their cell and boom. Anarchy. Riots,race wars,etc. Then it's over back to normal sometimes a 3rd wave. But historically that's smooth. I don't know why I just went with it since the other stuff made no sense either lol
I've seen several rationalizations of why people have eased up on public health practices despite the fact we are still actively in a pandemic:  \- "It won't happen to me (because I'm young and invincible and I'm more likely to survive it if I do)."   \- "If I get it, I get it. I'm gonna die anyway."    \- "It's a hoax. Everyone is blowing this way out of proportion. \[Insert completely different virus\] kills more people."   \- "This is just like the flu. We'll be fine."   \- "This isn't going away anytime soon and we can't be home forever so we might as well go back to business."  I should make it very clear I don't agree with any of these rationalizations. I haven't been inside of a store since March 21. I haven't gone outside, not even on my balcony, since May 10 (breaking it tomorrow to do a big batch of laundry). I've been extreme in my handling of keeping distance from others, but I also have had huge privilege in being able to work from home, having a stable income/job, and living in a loving home with a supportive partner.   In addition to the pandemic and all of the pain/death on the news, when you tag on the racial violence and injustice we're continuing to see it makes for a combination of really heavy, stressful days with no end in sight. I do not condone the actions of people going out without taking into account the overall health of the public and practicing social distancing. I also understand the desire to escape and the desire for normalcy, as well as the fact that not everyone has the privilege or the resources to stay home and be safe. This shit overall fucking sucks. I am tired and I'm sure you are too. I'm accepting that we can't control how other people act. I know that's frustrating when it puts literally everyone's health at risk. I've got no solutions or words for that. I just hope for as many people as you see out and about with not a care in the world that there are more of us doing the best we can, even if it means sacrificing a sense of normalcy in the short-term, to keep each other safe in the long-term. I hope you continue to stay as safe as you can and wish the same for you and your loved ones.
Cases are up because testing is up
Two reasons.  1. The actual numbers don't support anything more dangerous than the typical flu we have every year. 2. Nonsense like what you posted isn't flying with as many people anymore  Mecklenburg county may have a record number of cases, but how many deaths have they recorded? Not very many.  In the entire five months this has been going on there have only been 800\~ deaths for the entire state.  Of those:  63% were over the age of 75  21% were between 65-74 (puts us at 84% of all deaths)  12% were between 50-64 (now at 96% of all deaths)  4% were between 25-49.  If that seems like a really large range for a data sample, it is.  All 4% of those could have been, probably were, a lot closer to 49 than 25.  And the big one? Zero under the age of 25.  In a state of 10 million people.  And feel free to check my claims:  [https://covid19.ncdhhs.gov/dashboard/cases](https://covid19.ncdhhs.gov/dashboard/cases)  The CDC has confirmed that the virus is not spread by surface contact:  [https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2020/s0522-cdc-updates-covid-transmission.html](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2020/s0522-cdc-updates-covid-transmission.html)  And the masks do nothing but make you look really, really dumb:  [https://www.infectioncontroltoday.com/mask-respirators/surgical-cotton-masks-equally-ineffective-blocking-covid-19-spread-say-investigators](https://www.infectioncontroltoday.com/mask-respirators/surgical-cotton-masks-equally-ineffective-blocking-covid-19-spread-say-investigators)  Our senator Jeff Jackson has posted multiple claims predicting statewide devastation.  For instance, he originally claimed NC would see 4,400 deaths.  Weeks later that was backed down to 2,500.  At this point I think common sense has kicked in and he has stopped posting predictions.  He has not put forth anything resembling accuracy since this started, why would anyone believe anything our government 'leadership' has to say now?  Virtually everyone that has died from the virus also has at least one preexisting condition and/or is morbidly obese.  In essence, the same people that die from the flu that goes around every single year.  And cases don't matter, because what difference does it make if you get a virus that doesn't make you sick?  "Oh you're so selfish, what about the people that are at risk???".  We should quarantine them.  You don't quarantine the healthy, ever.  Not sure how that even became a thing.  Florida and Georgia have both opened without anything resembling a spike in deaths.  All of those beach parties from Memorial Day weekend?  Wouldn't we be seeing huge spikes in cases, hospitalizations, deaths?  We aren't.  The half a billion dollars we spent on field hospitals sure was a miss.  Half a billion dollars. Treated 100\~ patients?  And it was probably a photo op.  Again. Half. A. Billion. Dollars.  Basically people think it isn't an issue (BTW, painfully terrible question structure on top of the use of all caps), because it isn't.  It's a bunch of mangled data that's been manipulated to scare people, the smarter of which are catching on.  You also have a lot of die hard Democrats that are absolutely dreading the election and they are clinging to this thing like leeches.  Dreading.  Like every day they get up and know that in five short months they're going to lose yet another election, and on top of it, they know it's their own fault.  They spent four years going after the president and not only losing every single time, but drawing a lot of unpleasant scrutiny to their own positively laughable candidate.  They're backing an absolute imbecile, they know their platform has failed spectacularly and publicly, they know they are fucked.  Fucked.  Republicans could win a majority in the house in November, which would give them congress, the supreme court, and the presidency.  So since you have nothing to stand on, and even less to lose, you might as well jump on whatever bandwagon nonsense the left has come up with to distract from reality.  Smart people don't see it as an issue because they see it for what it is.  Nonsense.  If you really are eighteen, this is a good lesson for you.  Desperate stupid people will get behind anything, and be wary of mob mentality.  You'll never encounter an intelligent mob.  Short answer. It's not an issue because there isn't anything resembling believable data to support that it is and there are five months of false predictions, lies, and obvious political maneuvering to blatantly show that it isn't.
The number of cases on the dashboard today was 1,076. Just shy of the high of 1,107 on May 23.
For those who are looking for masks, you should know that 2nd & Charles is selling Japanese "fashion masks". I can't verify how effective they are, but they are definitely as effective as the cdc homemade masks if not more and they cost around $7. I've heard Old Navy is going to roll out a line of masks as well, but I don't know if they are available now or not.
Sounds like Karen had a few glasses of wine and decided to let her feelings pour out.
Could it be the WHO has changed their mask protocol again?  They did.  Per the World Health Organization,  you should only wear a mask if you are treating someone with Covid-19.   I personally was convinced when the preventive protocol was the same as H1N1 when I ran a self insured health plan.  Another factor would be media overkill reporting every study that had yet to be peer reviewed as fact. The recovery rate is over 99%.  We have sacrificed the jobs of 40 million Americans for deaths that are not even 0 03 percent of the US population.
Seriously? Get over yourself. If you don’t want to be around that or take the risk then don’t go out. Don’t go around saying if you aren’t wearing a mask then you are murdering people. Like do people really think I like this. Quit being dramatic, if you don’t like then you stay home I’m sure we won’t miss you being out and being a complete dick to everyone. Plus there is no mandate for anyone to wear masks we are following the law. I dont know who the fuck gives you the right to tell us we are killing people. Quit being a drama queen and go fuck off somewhere
I went to Project Lean Nation today for a smoothie. No masks, no gloves. Employee didn’t even wash her hands before she made my shake. So I guess I’m done going there?
From the looks of all these posts I am now convinced that being stupid is contagious. I will now wear a mask.
The government got what they wanted. They were counting on ignorance, people who flat out don't care, and those who just want to return to normalcy. 100,000 deaths. They are fine with more people dying
They're busy creating the 2nd wave.
Probably because The CDC estimates a 0.4 % fatality rate among the symptomatic cases. If you consider their projection that 35% of all infected cases remain asymptomatic, the overall death drops to just 0.26%.  Check it out on the [CDC website](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/planning-scenarios.html)
The wonderful WHO “Experts” just said wearing a mask is not necessary for healthy individuals. Only those sick or helping those who are vulnerable to the virus... BTW NOT a disease a Virus should wear the masks.
Wear a mask AND stay home??
Here, here. I wish a newscaster would say this.
Right wing propaganda and stupidity.  Don't forget that when looking at the excess death statistics the actual death toll from Covid is between 150k and 200k in the USA. And the country is just like it's over. We are gonna hit a million dead in a year easy.
Thanks Karen
Consider that part of life is taking calculated risks.
Ok Karen.
i blame the redhat's
Thank you for posting about this, I’ve been complaining but haven’t had the courage to make it a post.  Be safe and keep spreading the word!
Why don't you mind your own business
You can chose to stay at home...that’s the beauty of choice. Not everyone has to fit in with your views. The goal has been lost to many - to flatten the curve, not lock down until the virus is done. We were successful and are now opening up according to the government’s guidance.   Please quit with the panic and virtue signaling of staying home and shaming others. Holy smokes, every day with these types of posts.
If you're scared, stay home. Nobody else is responsible for catering to your wishes
Can’t wait for things to just go back to normal, this thing is way overplayed. I’m tired of working from home, and 35 million people aren’t even employed.
I just contracted COVID-19 from your caps lock being stuck.
Bro. Chill.
I worry that it’s not lack of knowledge but lack of compassion. People aren’t not wearing mask because they don’t believe it’s effective in limiting the spread. They’re not wearing them because they know it doesn’t really add any protection to themselves.
We live in an age of personalization for the sake of pleasure
Right here, the wife and I are the same. We also had a baby recently so we’ve had too.   We’ve become fatigued at the news, with people not caring with neighbors having parties and family that keeps wanting to visit without quarantining. Feels like we’re the only ones who see the plague before us  Take care brother/sister
Wow, that’s totally worth shutting everything down for 3 months, isn’t it?   Many probably would have died anyway. Like I’ve been saying for months, you’ve all been duped by the media. Once we flattened the curve the additional lockdowns are unwarranted.  Even states like Michigan with even more restrictions have shown better numbers than Georgia. Look it up yourself.  Michigan has over twice the deaths.   https://covidtracking.com/data
It isn't a matter of false data. The spread rate of covid-19 is double of the common flu (which has so many variations). It seems insignificant but it is much more deadly.
Yeah. That's what I meant
I'm just getting my EMT Certification and I have immense respect for nurses esspecially right now because they are at huge risk. Same with EMS services. You are the most at risk. And I feel for you.
[https://news.google.com/covid19/map?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen&mid=%2Fm%2F025rst1](https://news.google.com/covid19/map?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen&mid=%2Fm%2F025rst1)  The numbers he gave are incorrect and are state wide numbers.  Basically: \~100 new cases a day in meck county, 79 deaths total
> From what I’ve heard, hospitals are not in danger of being overwhelmed.  Looks like you're right.   (this is for Triangle area hospitals, but same idea)  >11 a.m.: Christian Lawson, Clinical Director of Emergency Services at UNC Health, said the hospital is ready to take on more coronavius patients as North Carolina's number of cases continues to grow. Lawson said PPE is more readily available now that China has resumed production.  https://www.wral.com/coronavirus/coronavirus-in-nc-live-updates-for-may-29-2020/19119597/
My barbershop isn’t requiring masks. They are allowing people to wait inside, disregarding the 6ft policy; and there isn’t a bottle of hand sanitizer in the whole place. I couldn’t believe it.
Jewish economists?
Yes me too. It’s good to have a reminder.
I think people got a little too worked up over this.
For real??? I work at Harris Teeter and a woman called me a "little bitch" because I was following our Covid policies with Masks and 6 feet apart. It's gross.
You're exacerbating the political-ness with that comment though.  If you don't want this to be a political issue then STOP BRINGING POLITICS INTO THE DISCUSSION.  I don't care if someone if a conservative or liberal; both sides are using COVID-19 for political reasons and it is only exacerbated by people continuing to argue via a political standpoint.
You need to see that msnbc reporter.
Or you could look at the facts.  Only a small percentage of people are threatened by this.  Those people being the elderly and sick.  The CDC also released the death rate of .4% yet logic and reason mean nothing to popular belief.  The .4% deathrate is way over inflated as there are many more people who have caught covid but were not sick enough to be tested. Sorry you opted to take the blue pill.
Free-dumb
The people I work for (a wrecker service) still just say it is all a liberal hoax. When business slowed down (we get paid by the tow not hourly) they refused to issue letters that we needed to get underemployment assistance.  So we have been trying to live on less than $200 a week. They also forbid us to wear masks at work potentially spreading the virus. Most of the other drivers think it’s a hoax as well. It’s very disturbing.
It's dangerous that people think masks are protecting them from anything and get false confidence. The virus enters your eyes, and main transmission path is long-residence-time aerosol particles (< 2.5 μm), which are too fine to be blocked, while the minimum-infective-dose is smaller than one aerosol particle.   https://www.researchgate.net/publication/340570735_Masks_Don't_Work_A_review_of_science_relevant_to_COVID-19_social_policy  https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/new-study-questions-the-effectiveness-of-masks-against-sars-cov-2#More-virus-on-outer-mask-surfaces
Ugh. My husband is a pilot so that's already enough exposure but he found an open bar in Tulsa the other day and of course he had to go.  I mean bars aren't generally hygienic, but I think I'm on the entire opposite end of the spectrum with my disgust of being in public.   It's like adding your own job hazard to an incredibly large job hazard.
Social distancing really doesn't matter when you're in an enclosed space. Everyone's fucked
There was an obvious solution to this problem. When you hear about a potential pandemic you order as many medical supplies as possible, shut down everything non-essential as soon as possible, limit international travel, cancel any payment towards debts (rent, student loans, mortgages, etc), and give stimulus money to people, not corporations. It's not rocket science, and it's cheaper than how we're doing things right now.  New Zealand just dismissed their last COVID-19 patient. Seoul had single digit deaths despite being comparable to New York City. It turns out having a responsible government and compassionate populace is the secret to handling tragedy responsibly.
I applied a little intellect to your link and determined that it was garbage because the graphs don't display number of tests, positive testing rate, or per capita death rate.
I wouldn't call it anti-intellectualism.  In fact, I think the complex issue of COVID-19 is very nuanced and not black or white on either side.
All that means is that there are more people infected.
Saying this please continue to wear a mask and socially distance yourself! It will only benefit you and everyone else. I apologize for leaving that out in the first post. It is serious and doesn't matter the age.
Yes yes yes we all know this.  We know its mostly fatal to at risk individuals. That’s not the point.   The point is you wear a mask and social distance to protect others, not yourself. Sure grandma shouldn’t be out. And she might not be.  But whoever gets her groceries or her neighbor at the retirement home might be.  And you just expect every at risk individual is going to stay home when told?  I wear a mask to protect others.   This is a major reason why a portion of this country has turned their back on masks and social distancing. Being comfortable in public is more important to them then protecting others. This is America.
"New normal" involves people wearing a mask. It is possible to beat COVID. Look at New Zealand, Japan, Spain. Hell, even other parts of the country are on the way to eradicating it. Everyone else's #s are going down and we're one of the few areas of the country that go up and up. And it's because of the mentality that people like you seem to have.
I don't know about you, but I'd like to keep my lungs fully functional for as long as possible, thank you very much.
> It's just not that dangerous.   I know multiple people outside the "high risk" zone who have died. I'm sure their grieving families would like to know your opinion on how dangerous Covid-19 is. Shame on you.
This is a bad take for several reasons. Covid is dangerous to everyone. It's more dangerous to the elderly but being young and healthy isn't going to protect you.  Also our hospitals are not stable we're at 80% capacity and that's going to be no defense once all the people who are being slack now start showing symptoms.
I see what you are trying to say.   But think about this for a second. In just 3 months the deathtoll has surpassed 100,000 individuals. Mind you, this is with many states in lockdown. In contrats, the flu in 2018 killed an estimate over 80,000 in an entire YEAR, with no lockdowns. What do you think the deathtoll will look like end of year?   Also, the disease is causing so many long term health issues that are not being taken in to consideration.   I lost my job, my career, and I am going through many financial hardships. And I still blame the politicans that have dismantled the social safety nets that could have brunted this disruption. Both parties. All administrations. I also blame a president who doesn't show any leadership or empathy. I stand with the scientists and health practicioners.    You will not be healthy and young forever, friend. Your family is/will be in that group as well. Think about it again when you are in the "at-risk" groups.
The problem with this line of thinking is that if you catch it and just go along your merry way you could give it to grandma at the grocery store and kill her.
You and everyone who thinks like this is missing the most important part. This line of thinking is whats causing cases and deaths to go up here. Sure, you take a risk and odds are you'll be fine. But you spread it to someone else who lives at home with a grandparent or even an older parent.   It's been shown that viral load plays a large role. Just wearing a mask in public (literally the least you can do) can help reduce the viral load people are exposed to giving them a better chance at beating the virus.   It's also easy to forget all the people with weakened immune systems. Do you have any friends (30-50) who have asthma or are diabetic? Your line of thinking tells me you don't care for their health. What about friends who are overweight? Lots of these deaths have been from people who are overweight. Have any overweight friends or family?
The new normal is living with exotic, life-threatening diseases with no vaccines that can be spread by asymptomatic carriers. That new normal absolutely warrants masks in public, period, and limitations on social contact. Covid has claimed seniors, adults, and children. Oddly, infants seem to fare better than any other age group. That doesn't seem to register with you.  You calling a disease "not that dangerous" when it outpaced a year's worth of flu deaths in 3 months is just wildly reckless. You've got this weird mix of "not dangerous" and "dangerous for thee but not me" that makes you a super-spreader and a danger to everyone around you. Do me a favor and stay on your own side of town.
I understand what you are saying and you have a 100% valid point. But taking simple precautions such as masks and 6 feet apart can't hurt IMO. I'm just worried that if people get too relaxed then we have the potential to overwhelm our hospitals, which is the biggest risk.   Just simple stuff helps. Im not arguing for full lockdown but come on, it's not hard to wear a face mask
What about the long term tissue damage the disease does?  Or the blood clotting issue?
COVID-19 most certainly can be defeated. Way too fucking early to declare eternal defeat. But otherwise, yeah. The CDC released new death rate numbers and they were much lower than previously thought. About 1.6% for people 65+, 0.4-0.5% for all people, and 0.05% for people 0-49.
This is true. CDC said death rate is .4% three days ago.   But you will be downvoted because popular opinion is a function of power and not truth. Power being flexed in the form of using MSM to convince people their reality is the correct one, instead of the one based on data.
Dangerous relative to what?
It’s for cheap karma
If you want to know why posts like this are important, sort comments by controversial. There are too many people out there who are loudly, vocally spreading opinions that their personal freedoms are more important than the lives and livelihoods of others, and they are going to succeed in spreading that message unless someone is willing to loudly, vocally tell them to shut up.
The people making these posts never go to Food Lion and other grocery stores at 6 in the morning, when it is the easiest to social distance. Instead they go during Saturday afternoon, and complain about the hordes of people not wearing masks
Fuckin humans
I haven't been inside a target in months. I only do the curbside pickup.
Exactly. You want to be outraged at all the insane people at target, meanwhile you’re doing the exact same thing OP, but just cause you’re wearing a mask it’s okay. Target has a fantastic website and extremely quick shipping. No one forced you to go to target and linger long enough to count 80 people
This so much^^ it's dangerous as fuck that people think masks are protecting or preventing them from anything.  The virus enters your eyes, and main transmission path is long-residence-time aerosol particles (< 2.5 μm), which are too fine to be blocked, while the minimum-infective-dose is smaller than one aerosol particle.   https://www.researchgate.net/publication/340570735_Masks_Don't_Work_A_review_of_science_relevant_to_COVID-19_social_policy  https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/new-study-questions-the-effectiveness-of-masks-against-sars-cov-2#More-virus-on-outer-mask-surfaces
While it is true that the particles are too small to be blocked be conventional cotton, most masks designed with this purpose use a material that has a tighter weave that does catch those particles, and while most homemade or "fashion masks" can be made without that material, applying four layers instead of two increases the effectiveness by as much as 50%. The layman test for this is to hold your material up to the light and, if you can see through it, it is not an effective material and will require multiple layers in order to be effective.  And I think it's worth noting that the CDC, regardless of any studies, is still currently recommending that people wear masks and practice social distancing at this time. When the CDC concludes that those studies are correct and that masks are not helpful, they will say so.
This! How is this not front page news everywhere?    I would think people would by dying to stop using the masks, they can't be comfortable.  But no, not only are they not going to read this and take from it, they're probably going to downvote you for even posting it.  Some people like the masks, they just do.  They like being part of something.
Members of the CDC say it is a big deal and you should wear masks: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/about-face-coverings.html
100% agree
Personally, I think we need to make face masks fashionable, as long as they're here to stay. Decorate them, make them out of cloth like the CDC recommends. Have some fun with it.
Why don’t you go on your balcony? Is it susceptible to covid spread? Honestly curious
Sample size of this study was four (4) people, but if you’re bought in anyway, this is from the same article:   “Further study is needed to recommend whether face masks decrease transmission of virus from asymptomatic individuals or those with suspected COVID-19 who are not coughing.”
From the same article:  "Further study is needed to recommend whether face masks decrease transmission of virus from asymptomatic individuals or those with suspected COVID-19 who are not coughing. "
Conveniently left this part out: “This experiment did not include N95 masks and does not reflect the actual transmission of infection from patients with COVID-19 wearing different types of masks. We do not know whether masks shorten the travel distance of droplets during coughing. Further study is needed to recommend whether face masks decrease transmission of virus from asymptomatic individuals or those with suspected COVID-19 who are not coughing.”
It's not about filtering all the air, it's about mitigating risk by limiting the spread, if I cough with a mask on the particulates in my breath don't travel as far as with no mask.  Same for breathing and talking.  Short of an N95 you aren't filtering the virus from the air you breath, but if everyone in the building is wearing a mask you're less likely to have virus particles in the air around you.  What you referenced just tested the virus reaching the outside of the mask and a petri dish right below the subject's face, as end of [this](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/new-study-questions-the-effectiveness-of-masks-against-sars-cov-2#More-virus-on-outer-mask-surfaces) article states, this experiment doesn't measure distance of dissemination.  Or as I tell my parents, my mask isn't a virus filter, it's a spit catcher.
% positive is also up a bit
People are infected whether testing is up or not, not sure why people feel like this is a valid response
So why are hospitalizations also up?
What? Thats crazy talk! You mean that if we test MORE people for the virus, the number of confirmed cases will go up?!
It’s like the projection went down because we collectively all made some sort of drastic behavioral change or something!  Weird!
Wow! There’s someone on here who actually has a brain and the ability to assess information and critically think about things!! Thank you!
Wow, gold.  Thank you kind stranger!
You are spot on.  Johnson County,  Indiana has more deaths (91 on May 29th) with a total population of 192,000 than Mecklenburg County.
Reddit is a left leaning circle jerk... Thx for posting this.. I wish I was as organized as you
Jesus you are fucking stupid
WHO? Do you not watch the news? We cut ties with them this afternoon. We have cut funding with them for a couple of weeks now.
This is the CDC explaining that it is vital that people wear masks right now and why that is: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/about-face-coverings.html  So when you ask "who the fuck gives you the right to tell us we are killing people", the answer is the cdc. Because the CDC is telling you that, if you aren't wearing a mask and taking proper precautions, you're killing people.
You read my mind.
If you don’t like it just stay home then.
As long as you wear a mask
While we're talking about the CDC, the CDC currently recommends wearing cloth face coverings in public settings because they "slow the spread of the virus and help people who may have the virus and do not know it from transmitting it to others".  Check it out on the [CDC website](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/about-face-coverings.html)
The official number of confirmed cases is 1.78 million. The official number of confirmed fatalities is 104k.   Please explain how that is .4%?  104,000 % 1,780,000 = 0.058426   0.058426 x 100 = 5.8%  Here's how to calculate fatality rate, and the difference between fatality rates and mortality rates: https://www.britannica.com/science/case-fatality-rate
That's not right. It's .04 out of 1, or four percent. If we were to follow your numbers it would only be four in a thousand dead. It's four in a hundred. If you literally divide the total number of cases in the US by confirmed deaths you get 6%. I know it's more complicated than that but the pandemic is far from over and we have only confirmed about 300k people recovered, plus it's hard to actually estimate the rate of asymptomatic cases - at any rate I just needed to illustrate how far off you are.
The cdc actually says it's over 6%  > Based on death certificate data available on May 28, 2020, 9.8% of all deaths occurring during the week ending May 23, 2020 (week 21) were due to pneumonia, influenza or COVID-19 (PIC). This is the fifth week of a declining percentage of deaths due to PIC; however, the percentage remains above the epidemic threshold of 6.4% for week 21. Data for recent weeks are incomplete, and the PIC percentage may increase as more death certificates representing deaths during these weeks are processed.  https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/covidview/index.html
With the shutdown it's killed 100,000 Americans (probably more) in the last 4 months.  Accepting your lowest possible number (which is probably too low) thats:  330,836,633 X .0026 =  860,175 American deaths that you don't care about.
I was thinking about this today on the way to work! Lots of traffic on the roads, pouring rain... I have a better chance of getting into a (potentially fatal) car accident on my way to work than dying of Covid. Yet, I make that choice every day without hesitation. Strange times. Just trying to wrap my head around it in my own way.
If you don’t like it just stay home then.
OP mentioned people not even wearing masks when they go out. It’s not about lock down.  Yes, as you say, people can choose to stay at home but these people ALSO need to get groceries, go to the bank, whatever it is. ORRRR everyone can just wear a f’ing mask when they’re out. It’s not that complicated.
"Virtue signaling" huh.
Not a single state that opened met the governments guidance on reopening
wearing a mask after the lock down is the minimum a conscience person can do.
We were told to lock down to flatten the curve, because hospitals would be overrun. That was three months ago and hospitals still havent gotten their shit together. Fear of being overrun again. Individuals are just repeating the panic they're being told to feel.
Haha you missed the entire point.
If you don't want to get hit by a car, stay home.  Nobody else is responsible for catering to your wish that they drive on the right side of the road. /s
Bro. Wear your fucking mask.
Wasn't aware you could catch cardiac arrest from someone. Thanks for letting me know.
Neither is being a respectable human being, but you probably should be.
Most cases are asymptomatic, most *deaths* are at nursing homes.
You know what else isn't against the law? Being a jerk off. Doesn't mean you should be.
Surely after you eat dinner you think to yourself “I’m not hungry therefore world hunger doesn’t exist”
Its regrettable, but I think you've nailed it.  Over the last few years I've noticed that people simply have stopped caring about each other.  I'm not saying that before people were more compassionate, but it seems that people have given up the pretense.
You're completely wrong and spreading misinformation.  Are you REALLY going to tell me that wearing a mask doesn't in any way help protect yourself?  Come the fuck on.
Can't compare numbers without taking into consideration factors such as population, spatial density, tests per capita, health infrastructure, discharge policies etc.  But what would you know, Panini head.
But wear masks so we can lessen the spread !!
Every life matters asshole.  Do you live under a rock or are you not aware of what is happening in Minneapolis?  E: here come the losers crawling out from under their rocks afraid of the word asshole.
uhh false data definitely matters...     Comparing the city of charlotte to state wide deaths is insanely incorrect.
Yes that it what I meant to say. I have edited to reflect that
Wow! I get that businesses are caught between both sides and don't want to upset the people who think that masks are unnecessary and this whole thing is over, but you have to do the basics to protect your employees. Come on.
i spit out my coffee...haha
How many of your friends and family members have died?
Damn. Wow. Stay strong brother/sister.  I find those that think it’s weak to wear a mask are projecting the weakness of being seen as protecting themselves, or they feel they are “tougher” than the ‘plague’ going around. Sad  Stay safe and keep wearing protection!
Sorry, as much as I want to agree with you and drag this back into a non-political scope we lost that control when Trump made it political. He blamed it on his perceived political rivals and fucked it up for you and me. Sucks brother/sister.   >	both sides are using COVID-19 for political reasons  Completely disagree. Liberals/democrats want government to assist those affected, specifically everyday people not investors and corporation. Because we need people working to make all of the economy work. That’s inherently a political process and in a better situation (one without trump and current GOP) there would have been more bipartisan work on this. It could have been much nicer, much like the 2008 Bush/Obama/McCain agreement to fix the bigger issue and compromise but nope. It was a hoax the moment it affected Trump. Again, sucks man, can’t get away from it now.
link?
That’s with everyone staying at home and practicing distancing. If things “go back to normal” it’s going to get worse. Do you think Italy was packing out their hospitals just for funzies a few weeks ago?
So the public health experts are wrong?
young and healthy people still get knocked on their asses by it. Some have to take 1-3 weeks off work to recover. That’s very destructive regardless of what your job is. Not To mention the long term pulmonary effects...
There were lots of people in their 20s 30s and 40s on the front page of the times the other day.  And that was just 1,000 of the 100,000 reported deaths in the country so far from this.  Plenty of young people with no preexisting conditions have died from this and your willful ignorance is not going to protect you.   I don't recall the CDC ever saying "you're fine if you're not old."
>	yet logic and reason mean nothing to popular belief  Let me guess, you think your more logical than other people? Or maybe feel more intelligent? You feel you have the ‘common sense’, and ‘get’ things more??  >	Sorry you opted to take the blue pill.  Ohhhh heyyyy there’s my answer. You feel supirior to others don’t you?   You’re just another lowlife like the rest of us trying to figure this out. You ain’t above nothing buddy. Just a bombastic egotistical peon like everyone else.  There’s a literal plague like event happening and you concentrate on percentage of deaths rather than the hard truth. 100,000 dead in 3 months *with* social distancing. Given enough time we will be at 400,000 deaths by late December. If you can’t empathize with 400,000 people losing family members, colleagues, neighbors or loved ones than you are really just emotionally unintelligent. Self-reflect on what’s important to you. I bet if you lost a loved one to Covid you would throw this heartless thinking out the window.   There are literal PHD educated doctors and epidemiologists with decades of viral research, they are studying and warning us of this. Who the duck are you
How do y’all feel about the current demonstrations in connection with the pandemic?
Forbid you to wear masks at work? This should be illegal.
A study was recently published showing that if EVERYONE wears masks, we can cut transmission of the virus by 75%! That’s huge dude.
Hope everyone can keep focused on this come election day.
That’s way too socialist of a response for America.
Are European governments and populations not competent and compassionate? Maybe the issue is a bit more complex than you're presenting.
This ^^^^
> I applied a little intellect   It's obvious that you have little to apply so that make sense.
For those determined to be ignorant, the US has the most testing by far of any other country- almost twice as much as # 2 which is Russia. Do I need to explain that if you don't test, you don't end up with "total cases" figures that make a cute little color coded graph mean anything?
Denying scientific facts is anti-intellectualism
Flu death rate is 80,000 without restrictions in place, WITH a vaccine. Imagine how high the number would be if there were no vaccine for the Flu. Easy to see that it would have higher mortality than Coronavirus.   Additionally, most deaths have occurred in pocket locations around the country as the statistics are beginning to show. The survivability factor has also increased over time as doctors have found better treatments. Where once ventilators were deemed helpful, it's come to light they may have actually killed more due to improper use and the use of blood thinners has helped substantially.  More people will be affected and killed by circumstances brought on because of the way this virus was handled than the virus itself in the long run. I'm speaking of the people who are missing out on 'elective' surgeries that have caused conditions to worsen, suicide rates, domestic violence, and other crimes that have been on the rise all around. Time will tell on this one.
From a public health standpoint death rate, disease rate, etc is measured as X/100,000. Covid is certainly a threat, but the death rate/ rate of highly acute disease just isn’t that high.   Not to say people shouldn’t be taking precautions, but we’re in pretty good shape in Charlotte. At the end of the day people need to know their own limits and adjust accordingly. The economy opening up is good for everyone- businesses, employees, the government.
Yeah my point is that of those 100,000 the overwhelming majority (it's not even close) are old. Of those remaining? A majority of them are unhealthy (obese, underlying conditions, etc).  How do we limit the death toll? By limiting the spread to those categories of people. THEY should stay inside, shelter in place, avoid public spaces.  Everyone else though? Their risk of death is ridiculously small and doesn't justify a shutdown
How can you assess long term health issues when this hasn’t been around for a long term.
I think you should blame the virus tbh.
That death toll is significantly inflated due to the monetary policies enacted for hospitals. The 0.4% mentioned above is the key number. The whole point about this comment is that we should reopen and allow life to go on, so your job, career, and financial hardships shouldn’t have happened or should try to resume.
Yup, pure selfishness.
That's not my point. It's that grandma shouldn't be going to grocery store in the first place. Grandma can place her orders online and sit in her car or even get them delivered. Is it sad that grandma has to stay inside? It's horrible.  But that is the tradeoff we have to make for the benefit of everyone
Well, hopefully grandma has the resources to avoid going to the store herself, or at least going inside (I believe walmart does curbside.)
I'm not sure how any of what he said above makes him a "super-spreader", but it's not surprising to see these kind of statements when the r/coronavirus narrative is spreaded throughout the city subs.
Or you can just lock yourself up in your hole and not worry about what he’s doing. You can’t catch it if you stay inside apparently so get your nose out of other peoples ass and continue to basement dwell.
Hopkins is saying somewhere between .5 and 1.0. That seems tiny,  it it’s still much, much deadly than the flu that kills ~60k+ when half of the population is vaccinated and proven treatments are available.
Its not all about the death rate, its the infection rate. It is highly contagious, which is how 100,000 people have died in 100 days from it
Thank you for posting this, as it prompted me to dig in and research the new CDC estimate. Here's an [article](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/05/22/860981956/scientists-say-new-lower-cdc-estimates-for-severity-of-covid-19-are-optimistic) interviewing various scientists who feel these estimates are overly optimistic. More worrying is the possibility that these estimates may be the result of political pressure than pure objective science.  Remember that the CDC is part of the executive branch, which has defined itself as having a blatant disregard for science and facts. The possibility that this corruption has filtered down into the CDC cannot be ignored, as disconcerting as that may seem.  The CDC has also not released information publicly to back up their models. That itself is a big red flag. Science must be based on openness and transparency. If the CDC does not want to be scrutinized, then we can't trust their numbers, especially in a public agency, which has a duty towards transparency.  Even assuming that the .4% is based on unbiased science, that's actually still a lot of dead people in the range of half a million people assuming that 50% of the population gets it. And the the number of hospitalizations will also be in the millions, causing long-term health and financial effects. We have to remember that even a fatality rate of 4X the flu is pretty bad, when you consider that the population doesn't have immunity as they do with the flu. So, many more people will get it and even more will end up in the hospital, which is no picnic.  But I hope the CDC is correct because .4% would certainly be more manageable and less catastrophic. However, there is still a lot of uncertainty. Many countries, academics and scientists have given estimates that vary widely. I would not accept the CDC estimate blindly. Remember it is still only an estimate.  Lastly, your framing of personal risk is misguided. Remember that when you get the virus you are doing more than putting yourself at risk. You are also putting at risk everyone you come contact with. You are helping to sustain the pandemic that will kill people older and less healthy than you. So, to put risk purely in personal terms doesn't make a whole lot of sense.
They also said " The scenarios are intended to advance public health preparedness and planning**.**  They are **not** predictions or estimates of the expected impact of COVID-19." in the same report, but people tend to gloss over that for whatever reason.
You know that the real Milton Friedman would agree with me and say that people should be "free to choose" (I've read the book) the level of risk they want to take on
You actually think that someone who watches Fox News 24/7 would read this comment and think “you know, OP has a point”? Chances are most anti-Pandemic people are not even on Reddit. I searched by controversial, I didn’t see any comments like that. If there were any, it was downvoted to oblivion and is not a popular opinion.  Most people think this virus is a big deal to varying degrees, so anyone posting on Reddit how “No OnE iS TaKiNg ThIs SeRIouSlY” when they go out in public and observe some folks not wearing masks is probably just virtue signaling to an echo chamber of like minded people for karma.
Trump and his administration leading up to the guidelines
Though it’s a tight space and not too far from our upstairs neighbor’s balcony, no, I don’t believe our balcony is susceptible. If I’m being honest with myself, I’m just really anxious and I feel safer in my home where I have full control over my health/safety. With most of my anxiety, I’ve had physical triggers. Covid-19 is invisible. It has made many normal things feel like a threat.
Exactly. It’s not proven. It shouldn’t be recommended without reliable evidence.
Hey FactCheckerer,   I heard only silence because you know WHO only recommends masks when caring for a coronavirus patient.  Why not trust our top scientists? Check your own facts.
What is the WHO guidance on masks?
Exactly. It’s not proven. It shouldn’t be recommended without reliable evidence.
Exactly. It’s not proven. It shouldn’t be recommended without reliable evidence.
That’s anecdotal. There is no hard evidence to prove what you said. Further study is needed.
Because the morons will glom on to any piece of information which they can twist to fit their narrative; it's too difficult for them to research and differentiate between correlation and causality.
It's a valid response as long as people use the 'confirmed cases' number as the infection count
I would like to see the data on symptomatic vs. asymptomatic persons that test positive for covid. I’ve looked for that data for Meck County and haven’t found any specifically addressing those values. Point being, is the correlation of more positive tests simply because testing is free and available to anyone and would only testing for those with specific symptoms show be a more meaningful value.
Yes, exactly! This gets to me as much as the saying, “muscle weighs more than fat.” No. A pound of one substance is the same weight as a pound of another substance. It’s the density that is different. Sigh.
It’s a fact, so can’t be invalid actually. You’re reading into something that isn’t there
Um, yeah. That would have worked if every single person stayed indoors and every single business closed and nobody came into contact with anyone.  You see those people at the store? Home Depot? The liquor store? All of them interacted with other people and if the virus was as contagious and deadly as the idiot brigade claims, there'd be piles off bodies everywhere and actually mass graves (not the fake ones the NYT briefly reported on).  Social distancing was the hook this needed. It gave dumb people something to occupy themselves with, and congratulate each other on Facebook about.    If this thing was legit, North Carolina would have a lot more than 800 deaths and social distancing wouldn't have mattered one way or the other
It is, and they need to enjoy it while they can.  Will be a whole different place if it's declared a publisher.  Thanks for speaking out.  Honestly, the data is right there.  They don't make it easy to sift through, but it's there.  https://covid19.ncdhhs.gov/dashboard/cases
Man, you and the other guy with 'fucking'.  When the bookstores open back up I hope you'll go buy a Thesaurus.  It's a book of synonyms for words. Synonyms are words that mean the same thing as other words.  I think it's weird when people respond with something this banal and don't bother to address any of the details I laid out.  Why bother?  Understand, I don't think you're intelligent enough to do so, but advertising that with a response like yours shows everyone else what an idiot you are as well.
Are you talking to yourself or Jesus?
While it is true our federal government has cut ties with WHO, our state and local public health officials,  medical professionals,  and laypeople still look to them and the CDC for guidelines. I personally don't rely on WHO and CDC guidelines for mask wearing,  but many people do.
Well I hope I come in contact with you
Well they serve food. They’re supposed to wash their hands before preparing it. And I’m pretty sure they’re supposed to wear masks as a part of the phased reopening requirements.
Dude these aren’t my numbers. It is the CDC’s numbers.
“It’s hard to actually estimate the rate of asymptomatic cases”  Ok so let’s not believe the literal CDC’s estimation of 35% and believe your comment on Reddit?
Hey man, also. You said “it’s .04 out of 1”  You clearly did not read the article I sent.  CDC doesn’t say .04....it says .004. Which is .4%
You are assuming 100% of Americans will be infected
That's not the point. These people not wearing masks are endangering their own lives and the lives of anyone they come in contact with. Whether op is personally in danger or not doesn't change that these people not wearing masks are either recklessly stupid or assholes or both.
Rally cry of the ignorant.
Yeah, virtue signaling.
Uhh, except that intentionally driving on the wrong side of the road is against the law and will land you in jail. So drivers do in fact have a responsibility to drive on the correct side of the road...  10/10 analogy /s
I do. But you can’t control everyone. Let it go.
Old people gonna old.
No because you have a greater chance of starving to death than dying of coronavirus.
This country has literally decided that it's over, even though it isn't close to being over whatsoever.  People are too worried about their self righteous behavior rather than the long term health of those around them.  The country is still averaging 20-25k new cases a day, yes testing is increased but that's still a large number per day.  I'm currently visiting family up in Winston, it is PACKED in this area every day, you couldn't tell a thing has happened.  This is going to get bad before it gets legitimately better.  When the bars open back up fully, it's going to be absolute madness.
I hate to tell you this, and i want you to know I'm not being snarky or mean... Just absolutely sincere.   America has been this was for a very very long time
Never said it doesn’t protect you in anyway, it does. But the protection is minimal and the known positive of wearing a mask is that it prevents the spread.
see i was expecting you might use those factors to show why he was wrong, but instead you just insulted him  which kind of leaves me thinking he's right, and 80-someodd deaths weren't worth shutting down for nearly as long as we have.
My in-laws in Chile have friends and neighbors dieing of Covid... covid doesnt care if people dont take it seriously.. :(
None, your point?
Since only 0.03% of the total population has had their deaths attributed to Covid-19,  odds are pretty low you will know someone who has died of this virus.   With some peer reviewed studies suggesting 27% of the USA has had Covid-19 in some form, it is more likely you know someone who has recovered from Covid-19.
I watched many (thought not all) of Trump's press releases during the past few months.  What I saw was frankly terrifying, not because of Trump's words, but the disparity between what he actually said or meant and the news articles that came out shorty after each briefing.  Don't get me wrong, I do not agree with Trump's policies, however seeing the media twist what was said in his briefings made me second guess everything I have ever heard about Trump.  So I must ask, did Trump really outright blame the pandemic on his political rivals?  I'm willing to believe that he did, however I am equally willing to believe that his words were twisted by the media in order to stir division and thereby increase article engagement.  Although I haven't seen the Tweet/video of Trump calling the pandemic a hoax, I do believe that is something he has said.  What I don't know is his intention behind those words.  Did he mean, "there is no pandemic, it is a hoax," or did he mean "I have seen the data from other countries, while this pandemic is bad, it is not nearly deserving of the panic and fear it has caused.  This pandemic is being used to instill division, anger, and fear among the US population;  it is a hoax."?     I can not claim to know his intentions, however I do not think things are as black and white as many believe.   In response to the "both sides" comment, I should have chosen my words more carefully.  I wrote a quick response without much thought, and  in reality I have not seen much evidence of democrats using the pandemic for political gain (although that could just be because such evidence wouldn't be prevalent on reddit), however the media has certainly used it to their benefit.
This person wants or believes they are wrong. Probably because it’s inconvenient for political or personal reasons.   But they are wrong anyone and you succinctly explained well.
They've been wrong a lot more than they have been right.  Cant count how many times they've revised their estimates.  First millions were going to die, the death rate was over 3%, the virus lived on the surface for up to 21 days, etc.  The CDC admits the rate of death is .4%, it is lower cause they haven't accounted for infected people that dont know they're infected.  The CDC is also saying its doesnt live on surfaces for any significant length of time.  Millions haven't died.  I could go on but it wont do any good.
What are the long term effects?  This has only been around since December right?  I'm not saying it's not bad I'm saying its has been way over hyped.
The numbers/statistics say you're fine if you're not old.  It's common knowledge the vast majority of deaths have been elderly and not the young.
I'm not like everyone else.  I'm thinking for myself and seeing threw the bullshit.  Oh hey this virus is so bad that everyone is going to die but let's keep Walmart's, Lowes, and other places like that open but not the mom and pop stores.....  Please stop with people dieing.  You think people didnt die before this.  Death is a part of life and will always be.  How many will die of drug overdoses, car wreck, violent crimes, etc by December?  Take your wanna be self righteous bs and peddle it to one of your millennial friends.
It was only a matter of time. Then again, I am a doomer...
I understand this and completely agree. One factor that was brought up was that the mask also prevents touching the face. I heard(this could be completely false and gossip) it was for also keeping the person from touching their face as well as the most common way is touching surfaces and then and touching the face. This maybe entirely false but thought it could be relevant in some way
Shocking news: it turns out that a government system focused on caring for its people first and capital second might actually be better for the average person. Related stories at 9, grass still green, sky still blue.
What European country are you referring to? Nordic countries aren't handling it well but they're in a special economic zone, so are they European? Greece is flat broke and doesn't have the money to handle it well, but they're in the EU, are they European? Germany is generally doing things better than most, is that European? The UK is trying to simultaneously leave the EU and dismantle their entire health care system (which is several layers of bad) is that Europe?    Your response to my point was "here's 30+ examples, I'm right until you prove all of them wrong." Europe is a complex continent politically, economically, and socially. You're attempting to combine that complexity with the simplicity of the solution I provided.
Yes that is true, but I don't think the majority of the people calling for reopening are denying scientific facts.  Some, for sure, but not all, or even a majority.  I believe that many of the people calling for reopening realize that a prolonged shutdown has it's own dire consequences.  I also believe that many people calling for reopening realize that the point of the shutdown was to flatten the curve and prevent hospital overload, not to eradicate COVID-19.  The curve has been flattened, it is time to start reopening, albeit slowly and with caution.
I am not getting into the details about the flu rate, since it is very nuanced to type.   What I meant to say is that imagine adding the totals of a new virus to the ones of the flu, how will that look like at the end.   We agree in a majority of things, I believe.  When you say "circumstances" on how the virus was handled, it is also part of the safety net I mentioned. Not only unemployment services and such, but international scientific/diplomatic collaboration, disease surveillance, etc.   What you said about people being affected "indirectly" like increase of domestic violence and suicide (and elective surgeries), speaks of the same lack of safety nets and mishandling of the response that I mentioned.   We agree. I hope you are well and safe.
Tell the world the last time the "death rate" (you're using the wrong terminology) killed 60,000 Americans in 1 month - vaccine or not.  It's no surprise people were protesting their liberty being infringed by mandated face masks in 1918.  Point?  You dismissive sentiment is timeless
Dude, long term thise pockets will spread especially without a vaccine.  >	Flu death rate is 80,000 without restrictions in place, WITH a vaccine. Imagine how high the number would be if there were no vaccine for the Flu.  Your own logic cuts both ways here. Your saying the Flu could be really bad without a vaccine, sure. But we’re three months into this and we’re at 100,000 deaths... meaning if we don’t slow it we will be at 400,000 maybe half a million by next Jan? Without a Covid vaccine. At that rate this IS as bad as a flu w/o vaccine........... why are you ok with two pandemic capable viruses, one running amok? That’s wild.   >	More people will be affected and killed by circumstances brought on because of the way this virus was handled than the virus itself in the long run.   Sorry but this is widely asinine. Car accident deaths don’t reach 100,000 in a year, barely two. You’re purposefully downplaying this and it’s reckless. This is where I draw the line and say your thinking is sadistic.   Like how do you think more people will die due to ‘circumstances’? All the adverse health issues both mental and physical are real, sure, but it will have to be 100,000 deaths per quarter for years to catch up with our current rate. Seriously reconsider this.
People should take precautions, yes. But we’re only three months into a viral pandemic that has no anti-viral or vaccine. This virus is a threat until we have more data, over more time and when we can limit its spread and stop healthy people from dying of it.  Please don’t spread dismissive ideas until we have the same amount of data as those other ‘public health’ issues you mentioned.
Because the short term is already really bad. That’s like asking if the AIDS crisis mattered when it was only 10,000 ~~cases~~ deaths. There is a clear trend and the crazy thing is unlike any other known virus we have zero protection against, no anti-viral for it yet or a vaccine to quell it. There are young healthy people dying on ventilators, imagine that? That’s the last thing a doctor can do for you is stick a tube down your throat and cross their fingers you don’t become a waste of that ventilators time. That’s dark brother/sister. It may not be you that gets it or dies from it but it’s someone’s mom dad sibling grandparent.
The respiratory distress the virus causes, known as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), has a clear history of long term decrease in quality of life and increased healthcare costs.
What tradeoff are you personally making in that scenario? That only benefits you and people like you, not “everyone”
Well I guess your mentality is why North Carolina is now considered a covid hotspot.
This is just ignorant. The majority of the elderly aren't going to do this and you know they aren't. You are just deciding that because they are not it's ok to ignore the restrictions and advisories.   Most elderly(including my parents in their 60s) are still going into the store, you can see them in there when you go. I've asked my parents to stop but they don't want anyone shopping for them. So I guess they should just die then because it's more important that you not wear a mask for some reason.   I mean if you don't want to, whatever, but don't act like you aren't aware that you will be contributing to fatalities personally while you do it if you don't wear a mask. Unfortunately these measures work exponentially better when everyone participates, rather than when those who simply feel like it decide to take part.  There is a medium where people wear masks, properly social distance, and actually take it seriously but it's quite clear a large portion of the population can't think past themselves and all they have to do is wear a mask and stay back from other people.
Exactly- grandma and all her tech savvy friends have no excuse to not order everything online and figure out setting up new accounts on different sites. Oh grandma you don’t know how oAuth2 let’s you login to Instacart using your Facebook ID? Guess there’s no food for you this week.
What world do you even live in? Grandma can order her groceries online?
I'm not going to risk others with the hope they know better. When I went to Walmart a while ago I saw quite a few old people there.
Copied and pasted for you. In response to: Why aren't people wearing masks out in public places?   "It's because covid-19 is only dangerous to a small percent of people. Should the elderly, unhealthy, or people otherwise with high risk factors stay inside? Sure. For everyone else? It's just not that dangerous. Do you know that the average age of death of covid patients is older than the average age of death of all causes? We've stuck our heads in the sand to avoid facts and reason  Our hospitals are stable, that is what matters. For everyone else? We can decide for ourselves how much risk we are willing to take on.  This virus isn't going to go away. We're not going to "beat" covid-19. Might as well accept that fact now and start moving on to a new normal"

E pluribus unum
I gotcha. Sorry to hear that
The reason that "testing is up" is a valid response is because the number of cases reported only means the number of cases that have been detected. At no point do we know how many people there are that have the virus but are asymptomatic or haven't been tested for some reason. In principle, it's possible that the number of people that actually have the virus (tested positive + undetected) is going down while the number of reported cases is going up. (Unlikely, but possible.)  Obviously when the number of people testing positive goes up it's not a good thing, but that number by itself is not incredibly helpful at describing the progress of the disease. And much of the time, when people say "number of cases is up," that's what they're trying to communicate - that the rate of infection is increasing again.  (Please note I am not making any judgement about whether things are getting better or worse. I believe the pandemic remains a serious problem and believe wearing masks is a good thing both for containing the spread of the disease and as a simple sign of respect for people at risk, either because of their health conditions or work conditions that expose them to a wide range of people on a daily basis.)
Muscle is more dense than fat, so an equal volume of muscle weights more than fat.
So you're saying people get the virus via testing?
You’re totally right - Nothing was different!  Restaurants didn’t close, retail stores didn’t close, workplaces didn’t close! It was business as usual! So true!
That would require thinking on his part.
I mean, he's just all right with me but to call him fucking stupid?  Kind of mean.
Actually the cdc says it's over 6%  https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/covidview/index.html
And you misread them.  Edit: I'm glad I'm being downvoted for explaining the difference between percentages and decimal ratios to an adult. That's where we are now, extremely chill.
Yes let's believe the "literal cdc". thanks for pointing that out  > Based on death certificate data available on May 28, 2020, 9.8% of all deaths occurring during the week ending May 23, 2020 (week 21) were due to pneumonia, influenza or COVID-19 (PIC). This is the fifth week of a declining percentage of deaths due to PIC; however, the percentage remains above the epidemic threshold of 6.4% for week 21. Data for recent weeks are incomplete, and the PIC percentage may increase as more death certificates representing deaths during these weeks are processed.  https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/covidview/index.html
The cdc says over 6%. or ar you not relying on the cdc anymore because it doesn't say what you want? I'm blasting all of the comments so that idiots like you don't go around thinking it's over twenty times less deadly then it is. You could get someone hurt   >Based on death certificate data available on May 28, 2020, 9.8% of all deaths occurring during the week ending May 23, 2020 (week 21) were due to pneumonia, influenza or COVID-19 (PIC).

The math/statistics skills of my fellow North Carolina friends is very troubling. I don’t see how they’re failing to piece this together. Good on you though.
Usually a buzzword that serves as a quick sign someone lacks a nuanced opinion.
What’s funny is he proved your point. Like yeah if you’re scared of getting hit by a car, don’t drive. We as humans take risks every day and it’s up to the individual to assess what risks they’re willing to take.
Didnt know I could starve of hunger by being coughed on
I have a friend (who happens to be a nurse) that asked me if I wanted to meet her at a bar tonight (sat night).... She said "are you still not going to bars or restaurants?". No, absolutely not in a rush to be near strangers slurping food and drinks and sharing germs with me for an hour.  So yeah annnnyyywayy. I agree with you about the worse before better and it will definitely be madness when bars do open.  I live alone and although I have missed my normal social life, I just can't reason with the risk right now.
How do you know that it’s minimal?  Do you think the ER doctor who puts on a mask as he’s treating a covid patient is doing that for fun?  For the patient’s concern?
80 deaths is after being shut down. The number wouldn't be in the same territory had you not shut down.  But true, opening up has to happen eventually, but not suddenly. A detailed lockdown exit plan is a necessity, but that seems to be missing.
Strawman argument.
I kind of think that was their point.
By the time it’s all over (1-3 years), it’s likely you’ll know someone to perish from it, unfortunately.
Could the million not dying have anything to do with shutting down nearly every country on the planet? Nah, couldn't be that.
As you say, we’ve only known about it for six months. Did some reading here: https://www.webmd.com/lung/news/20200513/complications-on-the-road-to-recovery-after-covid  Sounds like the worse your bout of covid, the worse the long term effects are. But then, it mentions a small study where people without respiratory symptoms showed some lung damage after recovering. The biggest problem is just not knowing if it’ll hit you hard or not! Even if you’re young and healthy. :/
You want to cite complexity but say there's one simple solution? I happen to agree with you that limiting travel was the key to containing it early. Stockpiling PPE is not possible in a worldwide pandemic and where there are indications that the origin country of the virus concealed its nature in part to hoard PPE- which they happen to manufacture because we rely too much on outsourcing.  I pointed to Europe because they have the most deaths per capita, so what is it that they did that was not compassionate or competent?
Agreed, though I think those same people are underestimating how little business/revenues they’re going to get until a vaccine or effective treatment is available. Sometimes it’s cheaper to stay closed than it is to reopen and have fewer customers.  Edit: after the last few days with all the protests, that curve will definitely be spiking! Just can’t win.
Honestly how many ‘circumstantial’ deaths and pain will outweigh the massive death rate?   While I agree with you, I don’t agree with the previous idea.   Not to mention the mental illness, depression, mental fatigue, and increase prevalence of domestic violence was exacerbated by a delayed reaponse to the pandemic, to lack of leadership to support everyday Americans and lack of resources and care by state governments to assist the unemployed.  Covid was already a fire, our governments and leaders fanned the flames and are telling us it’s being handled by the fire department they don’t listen to and constantly contradict.
Agreed. They’re reaching for straws in other massive pandemics to downplay the seriousness of this one.   100,000 is still 100,000. And there have been instigators throughout history, your completely right.  SMH
Your response is completely unrelated to my comment. We’re talking about diagnosing long term health issues for a virus that’s been around for less than a year. How do you get upvoted for this shit, how is Reddit so dumb?
First, it's not my or your tradeoff, it's society's tradeoff....   It's the opposite of the tradeoff we're making now, which is shuttering the economy, ruining peoples livelihoods, etc   All I'm saying is that we can reopen the economy AND avoid the deaths of people who are vulnerable. Those are not mutually exclusive things but we're stuck in a fantasy world where we think those are mutually exclusive.
Not to mention last time I check most places were two weeks out for online ordering. (Caveat is I only check two)
Or they could use the senior hours many stores offer that limits people in the store, or ask a family member or a neighbor to help out.  They might also qualify for transit rides with CATS.  You seem to have a very bigoted view of the capabilities of the elderly. Did you know Tim Berners Lee and Bill Gates are both 64? And they are not the oldest folks in I.T. or Computer Engineering.
oh well if grandma cant order online shes going to have a problem with those covid tracer apps some people expect to work
That's fair, and that's very kind of you.  Personally, I think at this point they should have the information needed to protect themselves.  And personally, I'll wear a mask, but I'm not willing to waste my life for a year+ (or longer, who knows if we'll actually get a vaccine) by staying home all the time.
No evidence, no mandate.   “There is no specific evidence to suggest that the wearing of masks by the mass population has any potential benefit. In fact, there's some evidence to suggest the opposite in the misuse of wearing a mask properly or fitting it properly," Dr. Mike Ryan, executive director of the WHO health emergencies program, said at a media briefing in Geneva, Switzerland, on Monday.  https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/30/world/coronavirus-who-masks-recommendation-trnd/index.html
I’m talking about people not understanding the entirety of it.
Well, I must be stuck listening to the clueless because the amount of people I come across who don’t understand is astounding and disappointing.
That is what I’m saying. I’m talking about the weight. Weight = same. Density/Volume =/= same. I’m saying that people often don’t understand, use, or interpret it correctly.
You mean to tell me you didn’t know that is the primary form of transmission?
No sir you misread them. Read the Symptomatic Case Fatality Ratio row again
[Here](https://imgur.com/a/SZfgGJG) is .004 as a percentage.   Here I am showing a grown adult that .004 as a percentage is .4%  Maybe that’s why you were downvoted.
the cdc actually says it's 6%. I've also not only provided my math but shown my work as well. But my math is troubling? I'd critique your math but you haven't provided any.   Here's my math again, that you find "troubling" lol.  The official number of confirmed cases is 1.78 million. The official number of confirmed fatalities is 104k.  104,000 % 1,780,000 = 0.058426  0.058426 x 100 = 5.8%.  what seems to be the problem? that you disagree?    > Based on death certificate data available on May 28, 2020, 9.8% of all deaths occurring during the week ending May 23, 2020 (week 21) were due to pneumonia, influenza or COVID-19 (PIC).

These people didn’t read the CDC article.   The CDC literally says .004  .004 is .4%.
Just stay home. You’ll be fine.
So your friend who's a nurse isn't worried? Or is it that she's already so at risk from work that going to a bar doesn't feel like more risk to her?
Maybe minimal was a poor choice of words, but the effort to get everyone to wear a mask is rooted in preventing COVID from being spread, not to protect yourself per say.    https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/in-depth/coronavirus-mask/art-20485449  The point of wearing the mask is to prevent the spread over protecting yourself.   My point is we know this and not wearing one shows selfishness and a lack of compassion.  To your point, not sure how I’m completely wrong and spreading misinformation.
> A detailed lockdown exit plan is a necessity, but that seems to be missing.  cooper has given a 3 phase plan what are you talking about
Yeah but they rarely wore masks as well. I understand that theres people out there that could die from this, but everyone acts as if everyone is that way or has the virus. I simply stay inside anyways, but to tar and feather someone for not wearing a mask is childish. We cant live in fear forever, youd have to be a fool to think major news outlets aren't exaggerating this thing.
Stockpiling ppe is easy, you use the defense production act to start making it in country in January and have a big stockpile by March when things get bad.
Well, sweden as a whole did nothing, and now they have the highest rates in Europe. They're so bad that the other Nordic countries do not want to let swedes visit.    [To date Sweden has recorded 4,395 Covid-19 deaths. While the country has roughly twice the population of each of its Scandinavian neighbours, Denmark (571) and Norway (236) have recorded significantly fewer deaths.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidnikel/2020/05/30/norway-denmark-snub-sweden-with-open-border-travel-deal/#16658c5b52c6)
You keep citing Europe as if it's one entity. It's not. Are the French compassionate? Yes, they've been protesting for over a year for worker's rights. Is Ukraine competent? No, they've been toppled by a fascist state. Are the Germans compassionate? Yes, they had to learn the hard way what happens when you're not. Is Spain competent? No, they've been on the verge of civil war for a few years.   So you're saying that the auto companies making ventilators couldn't have started sooner? We couldn't have started making and giving reusable masks to non-medical people earlier? We could have been acting in January, instead our government decided that if they said a pandemic wouldn't happen then magically it wouldn't. Now we're paying the price for being selfish and irresponsible in blood.
That is a very good point.  In my area, restaurants have reopened at half capacity, and for the most part have been full (with every other table being intentionally unused).  I can't say that it will be the same for other areas however, or the same for other types of businesses that have been closed.  There seems to be no way to really know the "big picture" best course of action.
Sure, it’s reddit that’s dumb mhmm.  Look dude, your comment was short, not really much to go on so maybe some more context or info.   Either way my comment stands. We can’t diagnose long term health effects. But what we know is bad so far. Unless you have a crystal ball your worried about something we can’t predict.   Problem is it seems like your comment is a downplay because of lack of information about the virus. Provide some more info or elaborate. Other wise stop using lazy insults.
We won’t avoid the deaths of people who are vulnerable by going about our lives like everything’s back to normal and wishing them luck while they sit in the car and wait for someone to bring them their groceries. We can’t expect the entire elderly / vulnerable population to self isolate indefinitely as the rest of the world continues on without them. And what about the young people, without any preexisting conditions, who also die? And those people self isolating out of fear while the rest of us go about our normal lives - what do they do? Stay home alone, isolating themselves from young and healthy family and friends forever, because those young and healthy family and friends have chosen not to care whether or not they transmit the virus.   I agree that it’s inexcusable to ruin livelihoods by temporarily closing businesses. I don’t have a good solution besides demanding our government provide emergency care and funding for its citizens. Clearly that’s not going to happen. But how selfish to decide, just because you’re tired of being inconvenienced, that social responsibility no longer applies to you. I hope that society doesn’t tell me to stay in my car and figure it out alone when I’m old enough to be high risk.
The HT I use only books out 1 week, not two. And has 14 pickup slots open tomorrow, with 20 or more each of the next 6 days. I just checked.
Yeah you here that old grannies? Get in the germ infected light rail to Harris teeter at 7:00am and just hope you don’t die because chad here just can’t stay away from da bar this weekend.
The standard, “What weighs more? A pound of feathers or a pound of lead?” Students always got it wrong the first time, occasionally the second.
Dude, this is so far out of the reality we face right now. You think testing, that shows if someone has the virus, is the reason people are getting the virus? Square that circle please. Show me some legit data to back that up.
Again, the numbers aren't presented with percentage symbols, meaning they aren't percents. They are decimal ratios.   .4 is not the same number as .4%; any calculator will tell you that. You have misread the numbers by an order of magnitude. If the death rate was .4%, then out of the 1.78 million people who have tested positive for the virus in the US, 7 thousand would have died. Does that sound right to you?
Or, do the math yourself? The information is available.   Here's worldwide fatality rates for the top ten countries in the world  https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/mortality  Please stop spreading misinformation.
You didn't read the cdc article. It says over 6%   >Based on death certificate data available on May 28, 2020, 9.8% of all deaths occurring during the week ending May 23, 2020 (week 21) were due to pneumonia, influenza or COVID-19 (PIC).

You aren’t my authority
I suppose she's not worried. I couldn't begin to dive into her logic. I mean she asked me as though I was doing some weird diet - "are you still not eating that?". I'd LOVE to get back out and enjoy the bars and breweries, but I don't feel comfortable risking myself or potentially others right now.
If they serve food, some are...
Gtfo man, stop acting so PC, it's not the time.  Call people what they are and get a damn backbone.
Do you have insurance? Look both ways before you cross the street?  Why?
In January when the WHO and Chinese government is actively lying about the severity of the illness? When every media outlet is saying "worry about the flu instead"? Hindsight is really great.
> Well, sweden as a whole did nothing, and now they have the highest rates in Europe.  Still way behind Belgium and behind the UK, Spain and Italy.
You don’t know what a long term health effect is, and your responses further prove it. Why waste words?
Good to know I might check them out next week
It was obvious /s
It says .004. You didn’t read the CDC article. That is .4%
Oh hey cool it's as high as 15% in some countries. Distressing!
Dude. I linked directly to the CDC. Is the CDC misinformation now?
With that username you have demonstrated that you have extremely poor decision making skills and have forfeited any remaining credibility you have.
Ok, thanks for clarifying. I guess I understood actual counter bars would be one of the last to open.
You mean January where a senate committee received such a big warning about the epidemic that a bunch of dirty senators went and sold stock and bought pharmaceutical and remote work stock.  By mid to late January the administration had real info that this was a real issue. They should have started preparing the country then.
Those high rates still point to the EU not being competent in their response
You still haven’t made a point. Make a point. Explain it then. Or keep being vague
My bad. If you meant that to be a joke I’m sorry for commenting. The internet is weird place. At least others will know it’s sarcasm. Stay safe.
actually the cdc says it's larger than that.  > Based on death certificate data available on May 28, 2020, 9.8% of all deaths occurring during the week ending May 23, 2020 (week 21) were due to pneumonia, influenza or COVID-19 (PIC).

It must be nice being able to ignore everything that doesn't fit your world view. I've presented cold hard facts and you just shrug them off because it doesn't fit your narrative. You're telling me i'm off by a magnitude of x26. That would be pretty easy to spot, no? and yet you just ignore it. Man, that would make life so much easier.
I'd still like you to explain the discrepancy here. How many people have died? Hmm?
The way you've misinterpreted the data? yes. It's why I linked johns hopkins university, as they have a clearer presentation of the data.  or again. Don't trust me. or johns hopkins. or this study*. do the math yourself. the official confirmed cases is 1.78 million. the number of dead are 104 thousand (in the us). these are official numbers even confirmed by your own cdc link. Is that .4% to you?      *Anirban Basu. Estimating The Infection Fatality Rate Among Symptomatic COVID-19 Cases In The United States.

Lol “great” “logic”
You're a fucking troll.  E: and you're scared of backlash to your perfect karma score. Deleting your comments when you get heated. Gotta maintain that perfect image. Fake POS.
The point, as stated in my original comment is that you can’t assess long term health effects when something has existed for 6 months.   Just because the point is lost on you doesn’t mean it wasn’t made.
You are assuming 100% of all people infected have gotten tested.   Are we going to ignore what the CDC says? Since when is the CDC not credible?
So let me get this straight- you are saying that you are more capable of predicting the impact of this virus than the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention?
You claiming it says .4 when it actually says .004 shows you are just making up lies. Any calculator will tell you your numbers are off by an order of magnitude. .4 is not the same number as .004.  .004 as a percentage is .4%  Maybe try reading what the CDC publishes?
The discrepancy is you believe 100% of people who have the virus have been tested for it. That’s absurd.  I am going to believe the CDC here and not DarkLoad who has already been proven to make up fake numbers that are “off by an order of magnitude”.
CDC article says .004. You did not read the CDC article, don’t trust the CDC, or are just bad at math.
I regret reading this thread.
ah yes, continuing to ignore the numbers? please show me where my math is faulty. Please do the information for yourself. we've told you you've misread the data and you do not want to accept this so now i'm showing you the math itself. Which part of this do you disagree with specifically?  The official number of confirmed cases is 1.78 million. The official number of confirmed fatalities is 104k.  104,000 % 1,780,000 = 0.058426  0.058426 x 100 = 5.8%  https://www.britannica.com/science/case-fatality-rate  also, again you're assuming all deaths have been counted as covid deaths when there is proof that florida has misrepresented the numbers along with other states. unless you really believe pneumonia is up 500% over the last 5 years of data. But who cares? there is 1.78 million confirmed cases 104k confirmed dead and you can't be bothered to even try and see if that lines up for yourself. Please, how is this math incorrect?
No, I'm saying i agree with accurate representation of cdc information, not cherry picked misinformation.  > Based on death certificate data available on May 28, 2020, 9.8% of all deaths occurring during the week ending May 23, 2020 (week 21) were due to pneumonia, influenza or COVID-19 (PIC).

So let me get this straight, we've shown you that you're not even looking at the information correctly, and you just keep doubling down wih no other sources, numbers, or statistics? just blindly repeating the same thing over and over again? think for yourself man. You won't listen to reason about your misinterpretation. And now you haven't even commented on the very obvious and easy to do math? the numbers are there for you to check. why are you not checking them? again you're saying i'm off by a margin of 26x and yet can't even seem to show that. Seems legit.

Which part of my math are you arguing with? you arguing against math and numbers now? Please, show me how I'm wrong? here is the math for you to dispute.   The official number of confirmed cases is 1.78 million. The official number of confirmed fatalities is 104k.  104,000 % 1,780,000 = 0.058426  0.058426 x 100 = 5.8%  You're right this isn't including everyone who is infected. It's also not including everyone who died as there is already proof that florida, georgia, and texas have reported covid deaths as pneumonia.  Here's how you calculate fatality rates:  https://www.britannica.com/science/case-fatality-rate  please include your work since you're so confident I am wrong.
The math just doesn't work out that way, man, you're misreading that data and trying to blame me for it.   There have been 100,000 deaths in the US. So let's say that your number is right and that is a .4% mortality rate. It's not, it's 6% of tested cases, a calculator can tell you that, but we'll set aside fact for now. To reach that number of deaths with that death rate, the infected number would be 25 million, not 1.7million. I'm sorry but that's just not plausible. Even with 35% asymptomatic cases that means a symptomatic infectivity count of 16,250,000. That isn't what's happened! Utterly counterfactual.
And you stirred more controversy than me directly calling someone an asshole. You're also now a hypocrite.
How is my math wrong? CDC predicts fatality rate for symptomatic cases to be .004.  .004 = .4%  Where is my misinterpretation? If anything, I proved that the other guy isn’t capable of converting decimals into percentages.  And just to confirm- you do not think the CDC is credible?  I’m not sure why you don’t think the CDC is a credible source with accurate information.
You’re telling me that your math and conclusions are more accurate than the CDC.  It’s not “my” number. It is literally what the CDC published. I linked it if you want to read it
ha funny. If I am incorrect though, then how so?  I've given you proof that it's 5.8% and you have yet to comment on it. You've literally commented on my math zero times. It should be very obviously wrong, correct? which part of my equation is wrong? you just keep ignoring it. I've shown my math. You've just ignored it.   I've also linked to other sources that show the fatality rate to be 5.8-6%....unless you think John Hopkins school of medicine is incorrect? or the encyclopiedia brittanica? If you don't believe me here is what the cdc says since that's the only thing you'll believe even over numbers you can see for yourself  > This is the fifth week of a declining percentage of deaths due to PIC; however, the percentage remains above the epidemic threshold of 6.4% for week 21. Data for recent weeks are incomplete, and the PIC percentage may increase as more death certificates representing deaths during these weeks are processed.  https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/covidview/index.html   You're right we should go by the cdc. that says it's actually over 6%. guess I was being too conservative. Thanks for backing me up, I really appreciate the support.
Man, I'm sorry you only want to look at one source, but literally one article from the CDC is not the whole picture. Again, we have death statistics that show inaccuracies. The death rate in the US has been 6%. That's factual.   Here, you love the CDC so much, here's their death count. Bust out your calculator and do some division: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html
/u/BigNoseMcGhee ?  You just commented:  >Where is my misinterpretation? If anything, I proved that the other guy isn’t capable of converting decimals into percentages. And just to confirm- you do not think the CDC is credible?  You were so happy to call out /u/darkload1 but as soon as I call you out on your bullshit you've got nothing to say?  If you're going to sit here and tell me other people are wrong, at least be man enough to admit when you are. It's anonymous on the internet there's literally zero consequences.
Correct that is the amount of deaths and the amount of confirmed cases that have been tested.  In the other report the CDC published, they take into consideration that there are a large amount of people who have contracted the virus that never got tested, and those who have 0 symptoms, to estimate a death rate of .4%.   Amount of people dead does not equal death rate of people who have contracted the virus.  They know that not everyone who gets the virus also gets tested for it.
Get him king
Looks like my comment got deleted. Seems like this post has a certain agenda...  Yeah you’re wrong though. 004 is .4%. CDC published it.
  I already explained that the numbers don't work out that way, but go off I guess.
And you won't acknowledge the fact that several states have misrepresented the death tolls, as proven by several investigative articles. But since we can't verify the variables on either side of the number (there are people dying of covid not being counted like in florida and there are people not being tested) the only logical and sane thing to do would be to use the data we currently have. Which of course you don't want to use. So you just bury your head in the sand and ignore figures. Great job.
You can say i'm wrong all you want champ, but unless you explain this from the cdc, or my math you're not fooling anyone. why would the cdc publish this if it was .4%?  Laughable response.  > Based on death certificate data available on May 28, 2020, 9.8% of all deaths occurring during the week ending May 23, 2020 (week 21) were due to pneumonia, influenza or COVID-19 (PIC). This is the fifth week of a declining percentage of deaths due to PIC; however, the percentage remains above the epidemic threshold of 6.4% for week 21. Data for recent weeks are incomplete, and the PIC percentage may increase as more death certificates representing deaths during these weeks are processed.  Please double check me. I'm providing you ways to prove me wrong, including the math, and you just aren't.  https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/covidview/index.html
Do you disagree with the cdc now? I guess you're saying you disagree with the cdc.  https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/covidview/index.html
did your brain melt? are you ok?  You: the cdc says it's .4%  Me: actually they are saying it's 6.4%. here's a direct quote and a link to the official cdc website clearly stating it is 6.4%  You: but they say it's .4%   Like WTF dude? I'm linking to the cdc stating that it is 6.4% and you still don't want to accept it? you can read it for yourself on the cdc website. are you so far gone that facts mean nothing to you?   And before you comment again about it being .4% (because let's be honest, you will despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary) you MUST explain to me if that is an accurate representation of that data then why is the cdc saying it is 6.4%?
/u/BigNoseMcGhee ?  Dude you were more than happy to argue with me repeatedly when you thought you were right. All I'm asking is that if you're going to declare that I'm wrong, like you just did, at least address my arguments.  I thought I'd give you a chance to defend yourself before blasting your account on r/moronavirus, but I guess you really don't have anything else to say. I guess your final argument is really that cringey and bad.   in my 8 years of reddit I've never seen someone so intellectually dishonest. What a shitty thing to do to someone. If you showed me I was wrong I'd actually look at the information and take it in. But you're just going to argue, argue, argue, until there's evidence you're incorrect. Then just stop responding and still claim victory somehow?  This is what losing an argument looks like. Your fragile ego just can't admit it.

WHY DO PEOPLE THINK COVID 19 ISNT AN ISSUE ANYMORE


The Coronavirus Becomes a Battle Cry for U.S. Extremists

My mama always says stupid is as stupid does.

Coronavirus trend ‘stable,’ Meck officials say, despite large increase in cases over 24 hours

Current numbers suggest that we are barely keeping the rate of infection, the R0, close to 1, meaning that we are plateauing where each person is infecting one other person, essentially sustaining the current infection rate, which is manageable.  However, keep in mind that the "natural" R0 of covid without restrictions is closer to 5.7, meaning each person infects 5.7 other people on average. As we ease social distancing, the R0 will go higher, which will trigger exponential growth, meaning that the numbers will get quickly out of control. Even an R0 of 1.5 would trigger rapid growth and consequently another shutdown. Here's a fun [calculator](https://gabgoh.github.io/COVID/index.html) to see the effects of R0 on the curve.  The only other way to keep R0 down is through massive testing, contact tracing and PPE.  Our political leaders are not being straightforward with their constituents about how this works. The standard advice from epidemiologists is that we should be at the trough of a wave before we open up, not at the peak plateauing. Plateauing means that we are barely keeping the virus under control now and that any relaxation will trigger loss of control.  The fact that we are opening up at a plateauing peak is an act of wishful thinking and desperation. In another 1-2 months, we are going to learn a painful lesson when we are forced to shut down again. The only thing that might mitigate this outcome is hot weather. That's an unknown variable. If we are lucky, it could delay the next wave until the fall. But that is a pretty big gamble.

North Carolina's Coronavirus Testing Rate Is One Of The Worst In Nation

I'm not sure why this seems to be telling a different story, but this NPR article compares testing rates and positive test result rates vs targets across all states.  Scroll down. https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/05/07/851610771/u-s-coronavirus-testing-still-falls-short-hows-your-state-doing   NC not doing terribly.
that’s not good
Is one of the worst in testing really that bad? Since testing is bad all over our nation. It would be nice to have a  Competent leader of the federal government to set a standard of testing for the country.
If we are only testing people with symptoms doesnt this mean that most people aren’t sick then?   I realize why youd want to know if everyone has had it, but this either means that we are a particularly immune/hardy (as in dont present any symptoms) population, or that it hasnt hit too hard here, right?
So we finally agree that Roy Cooper is incompetent?
This could be a good thing.  Healthy people probably don't feel a need to go get tested.  This does not seem to be due to a lack of testing capabilities in North Carolina
One may even call it bad.
Not necessarily, since a lot of people who are infected are asymptomatic, they can still transmit the virus and not have any/mild symptoms.
I see testing places all over with no people at them.
> If we are only testing people with symptoms doesnt this mean that most people aren’t sick then?  From anecdotal evidence on my end, most people aren't getting tested unless they show the majority of symptoms.
He's trying his best being shackled by traitorous Republicans.
Healthy people can still carry and spread the virus  And testing can let us know if we've reached herd immunity.  There's no upside to not testing.
I’ll bet most people have already had it, they’re just hiding it from us.  They’re finding that hundreds of thousands in the SF area tested positive without any symptoms. The mortality rate will go down tremendously because of that, once it’s leaked.
But theres no reason to assume that % of people is any greater in nc than anywhere else.
Not just that, bit I have known people who were showing a few symptoms but they were turned away. My wife's boss had a fever and a cough and they refused to test her because she was not considered a person who was 'at risk' since she was otherwise healthy
"traitorous republicans"  had very little to do with any of Cooper's response. He decided to shoulder this burden himself and I am honestly shocked that he has not been called out for the fairly lousy job he has done.  Call a special session in Feb or Mar to pass legislation for unemployment? Nope  Overwhelm the unemployment system almost overnight with no firm plan to ramp up customer service or claims processing?  Yep  Issue statewide orders affecting everyone in NC while ignoring the fact that half the counties in the state have **10 or fewer cases**? Yep  I really hate that Cooper is a democrat and therefore gets a pass any any serious questioning of his handling of NC. Multiple reports have condemned his response to the hurricanes as inept. He was caught red-handed creating a slush fund by extorting energy companies for pipeline approval, and now he created one of the biggest unemployment messes our state has ever seen. But the response in the media and on reddit is to avoid any and all criticism lest it lead to another republican getting elected because republicans are so *evil*.
It is your statement that is the reason our country is so messed up. Instead of calling out people that screw up, you blame it on the opposing party.  Man up and take responsibility for your politicians.
I agree. Antibody tests would be helpful too.  But the people have to go and get the test.  Nobody forces you to get tested.  The fact that not many people are getting tested may indicate that not many people are getting sick.
Cooper can only do what the Senate allows him to do.  Good luck getting any kind of unemployment expansion out of the Republican majority.
Yes, they are evil.  There is no group working to make the world a worse place than conservatives.
Hmm, when it's the same group of people consistently doing the absolute worst jobs possible in order to line their own pockets it's pretty easy to call them out.  But keep buying that fox news pulp and making the world worse for it.
I was about to say that. I feel healthy and have not been tested.  No one has asked me to test.  I imagine this is true for lots of people.
> Antibody tests would be helpful too.  Antibody tests [don't work](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/24/health/coronavirus-antibody-tests.html) as advertised. And could potentially be really harmful if they are returning false positives and people then think they have the antibodies when they really don't so they could be contracting and spreading the virus and they think since they had the antibody test they are good to go. We actually received one from a doctor in SC who is a family friend of my gf's aunt. Came back negative, but I take it with a grain of salt
Getting "sick" and getting the virus are not necessarily the same thing. Testing people who appear healthy will still provide a lot of valuable information and help protect the vulnerable. We should be testing as much as possible.
>Cooper can only do what the Senate allows him to do  In regards to policies such as payment amounts and length of benefits you are correct, however Cooper is the chief *administrator*, and the problems that have plagued NC's unemployment during this time have nothing to do with the amount or length of benefits and *everything* to do with how the program has/is being administered.   It is a subtle difference that most won't admit because of partisanship, but it is a key difference nonetheless.
If you don’t think politicians on both sides “line their own pockets” then boy are you in for a surprise
That’s exactly what antibody studies do.  They ask random volunteers to submit to testing in an attempt to determine what percentage of the population has already had a disease.   Testing to determine if you have a disease is not needed  until you have symptoms or have a known exposure.  The problem NC has right now is we are still rationing tests and so we are not testing many of any folks who have been exposed.  With the long incubation period this means you could be feeling fine while infecting others.  Contact tracing and testing will be critical to reopening without a second wave that’s worse than the first.
Great point!  Some antibody tests seem inaccurate.  Someone should do their homework on the accuracy of the test before taking
Your right.  But the lack of testing is due to the the people's lack of desire to be tested, not the lack of testing capabilities
> we are still rationing tests  This is incorrect according to the article which quotes the state’s epidemiologist and the governor.  The article also states that there were 16 drive through test sites last weekend
I did. I was a naysayer of it from the beginning but when for the test to placate my gf. I was taking that test with a grain of salt from the get go

If you had the chance to live out your wildest sexual fantasy, but it meant that you WILL get Coronavirus... would you do it?

With the Coronavirus having a .04% kill rate, this is not a big risk.
Save yourself the trouble and hire an escort.
4%, not .04%.
An escort with coronavirus?
Nope. 4% of those that are tested. 0.04% actual death rate. Antibody tests have shown that 30% - 40% of the total US population has had the virus and did not know it.
Now that's a party...

Coronavirus Antibody Testing is available for $10 - Available to all

"Positive results may be due to past or present infection with non-SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus strains, such as coronavirus HKU1, NL63, OC43, or 229E"  So it's not a completely useful test, since you might have had a previous coronavirus strain but never covid19, and the result would still say positive.  But still might be good to know.
>This test can be ordered through your doctor, either in-person or via telehealth; through a telemedicine program if offered by your health plan or employer, or through some employee wellness plans. The test can also be conveniently requested through LabCorp.com using an independent physician service, PWNHealth, to determine if the test is right for you.   Am I misinterpreting this, or does it still require a doctor recommendation? How is that “available to all”, or any different then current procedures?
Idk about you, but the last time I went to labcorp they were terribly slow / backed up / packed in line sardines in the waiting room.   I barely wanted to be in that situation healthy, let alone when there’s this whole situation going on.
i cant take things seriously when i see an organization named PWNHealth
Yea. Pretty much useless. How many people won’t even be aware of that when they get their results?
*You can get the test through your doctor, healthcare provider, or through LabCorp.com. LabCorp.com offers a convenient option where an independent physician will order your test and you will have an opportunity to consult about your result.* The fee for this service is $10 and is collected on behalf of PWNHealth for physician oversight services.*  So Labcorp is essentially offering up it's own "physician referral" for testing if you contact them directly.
My friend has done it already - no doctor referral was needed.
Eihh the only time I’ve had to go were for drug tests which they only do first thing in the morning. If you get there early it’s like a 20 minute in-and-out
You’ll at least know for sure if you test negative for all
I had gone for a wellness thing through work - made an appointment and still had to wait like an hour.
This is true....unless it’s a false negative

Unreleased White House report shows coronavirus rates spiking in heartland communities - Charlotte listed as a "Place to Watch"

>	Places to watch  Suck on that, Raleigh!
But per the chart, new cases per 100k in Meck county has remained flat. Why is this article including us with KC for their 200% increase figure?  Is there something I missed? Seems a bit of a disconnect.  EDIT: Why is Meck 0% and Charlotte 268% per the report. I want to understand. This is what is not making sense. No way are the suburbs dragging meck to 0. I legitimately don't understand this discrepancy, and am trying to understand.   EDIT 2: What I'm referring to is this   Meck: 712 new cases / 65p100k / 0% increase.  CLT: 995 new cases / 38p100k / 268% increase.
I have seen a big increase in relaxed efforts. Hardly anyone is wearing masks or gloves and most are forgetting to keep 6 feet apart when interacting.
> On a separate list of "locations to watch," which didn't meet the precise criteria for the first set: Charlotte, North Carolina; Kansas City, Missouri; Omaha and Lincoln, Nebraska; Minneapolis; Montgomery, Alabama; Columbus, Ohio; and Phoenix. The rates of new cases in Charlotte and Kansas City represented increases of more than 200 percent over the previous week, and other tables included in the data show clusters in neighboring counties that don't form geographic areas on their own, such as Wisconsin's Kenosha and Racine counties, which neighbor each other between Chicago and Milwaukee.
I live in Rowan county, work in Iredell.  From the beginning it seems like around 50% were taking precautions (masks, social distancing).  After we went to phase 1 on Friday, the very next day every store was packed with people and hardly anyone taking precautions.  I think the general public thinks "Ok, its over and everything is fine again".  Of course most people in my area only get their information from Fox News so it's not that surprising honestly.  I give it about month before shit hits the fan and everything is locked down again.
Watch this space, the news at the end of this month will make whats happened so far look like a joke.
I live in the Charlotte NC area and I can tell you that my area has not social distanced and there were few masks being worn. It has changed some, but not much.
The wife and I are moving from 30 minutes from Detroit to 30 minutes from Charlotte next month. We'll have dealt with the wave here, and move just in time to deal with the wave in NC.... Perfect timing!
Charlotte is under “Stable Locations” chart
If it is unreleased how is it released?
Its almost like people starting to say fuck it to social distancing is increasing cases for a disease we have no herd immunity to yet. And just as we start reopening businesses and are coming towards memorial day weekend. Mid June is gonna end up in a full shelter at home order again for sure.
This seems like BS and contradicts the other data that we’re seeing.  Cases in CLT have gone up a bit (at least they don’t appear to be decreasing) but that’s largely a result of increased testing (which is a good thing!)  How do we know this?  Well, (1) the positive test rate is around 7% (the WHO recommends below 10% positive as a measure of sufficient testing to reopen) (2) hospitalizations are flat to down.  Is we were truly seeing increased COVID in the area (rather than just catching more positives via better testing) then hospitalizations would be going up too.  So far, I think we’re in a really nice spot here in CLT when compared to many other places in the country.  Let’s hope that the looming Phase 2 doesn’t change that.
How does NBC get something like this if it is unreleased? Does someone leak it?
If it's unreleased then why do we have the info?
I put a face mask on my big balls and it gave me this raging hard on:
This will put Charlotte on the map!
I've been talking with some co-workers about the recent Antibody testing we're doing. We've seen small percentages of people test positive, meaning that for a large part of our population here in CLT, there's greater potential for our cases to increase.  We all hoped to see more people test positive for the antibodies. That would mean (hopefully) more folks are protected (if the science is correct).  Knowing this I'm even more concerned with the second wave once stuff starts to reopen.
Agree - not sure where that's coming from.
Are you able to make the chart larger? Shows up very small for me and I can't make it big enough to read.
I was wondering that too. They also mentioned Nashville which is in Davidson country yet only the neighboring county of Rutherford is listed. It must because the chart is dated May 7th while the article was published on the 11th.
It interesting how people perceive our case trend as "flat" based of recent statements by our local leaders, when, in fact, it was never flat in any meaningful sense. We were at a  point where we thought we might be flattening the curve but that is very different from being flat now. The word "flattening"  doesn't say anything about when the peak is projected to occur. As long as rate of infection is going up, which it is, then the peak is still out in the future.  What is most counter-intuitive and frustrating for people is that the more social distancing, the longer the curve and the further out the peak. So, "flattening" actually means that we will be locked down even longer and suffer economically more time, not less. On the other hand, if we all went back to our normal lives and pretended like the virus didn't exist, the pandemic would be over much quicker because a ton of people would die and we would build herd immunity more quickly.  The only way to break out of this stranglehold is to socially distance smarter rather than harder, i.e. by testing and tracing so that you can socially distance a small segment of the population rather than making everyone suffer. Our current approach is an extremely painful "brute force" approach to social distancing that will not give us happy results. We must figure out clever methods to socially distance smarter, and there are a ton of proposals out there that people aren't talking about, which is frustrating.
You have to scroll down another page; Charlotte, NC is listed individually on the right/yellow chart with a delta value of +268% over the last week
“On a separate list of "locations to watch," which didn't meet the precise criteria for the first set: Charlotte, North Carolina; Kansas City, Missouri; Omaha and Lincoln, Nebraska; Minneapolis; Montgomery, Alabama; Columbus, Ohio; and Phoenix. The rates of new cases in Charlotte and Kansas City represented increases of more than 200 percent over the previous week, and other tables included in the data show clusters in neighboring counties that don't form geographic areas on their own, such as Wisconsin's Kenosha and Racine counties, which neighbor each other between Chicago and Milwaukee.”   I think it’s a separate list
It could be that while Charlotte had increased 268%, the rest of Meck decreased, leaving the county numbers flat.  But that seems unlikely IMO.
Maybe Trump want to personally monitor Charlotte because of the RNC.
We are not flat. That was more wishful thinking than reality. Rather than quibble over the exact numbers, it's obvious that our numbers are not going down. And with the easing of social distancing, they will go up more. Even small changes in the rate of transmission  (R0) can trigger exponential growth.
Do you really feel like trusting anything out of this white house?  But agreed, this has got to be bad data or possibly some type of reporting anomaly based on how data was added/updated that makes it look like we are increasing.  If Meck is flat Charlotte has to be flat or close to it since the majority of the cases in Meck are Charlotte.
Maybe it's due to the fact that we had our phase 1 of opening on Friday. Could be expecting increases.
But also, 995 new cases in one week? is this number confirmed anywhere else? Is there something I'm not understanding?
People forget that the stay at home lift just means the ICU has room for them.
Quarantine part 2 August 2020.
I think it speaks volumes that most businesses have their staff masked and gloved and these rare few businesses that don't are in the news. It's not "news" that I got groceries, prescriptions, and takeout this week and every employee at every location was in PPE. It is "news" that one lady at Lowe's had her mask around her chin so she could talk face-to-face with her friend in the middle of the aisle. It's "news" that a restaurant in Colorado defied local orders and opened to a packed house on Mother's Day, a move that prompted the government to suspend their license and shut them down indefinitely.  Wearing a mask has been politicized. In your heart, either you wear a mask to protect yourself and the public, or you don't wear a mask because your "freedom" is more important than the liberal hoax. And I hate saying it that way, but that's what unmasked protestors are actually saying.
A lot of people here really do believe that they're immune to the real world and it's consequences, especially suburban Charlotte
Ditto. The stay at home order was lifted, not let's all start infecting each other again.
I went from home (South End) to my office (South Charlotte) to my bank on Central, and home again. I didn’t see a single person, except myself, with a mask on.
Not sure about your CoronaVirus, but mine is both polite and smart. It keeps a calendar, follows rules and only comes out at night.
If a wealthy President isn’t wearing a mask, dahling, it must mean that Covid is for the poors!  /s
Live in Dilworth and these entitled people are the worst with masks and distancing
It’s the same here in LA. I went to Santa Monica and no one was wearing one. I planned on going for a walk, looking at all the big houses, but was too scared and went home. The lack of traffic is terrific though
I don't think there's been a week where we've had a 200 percent increase in the rate of new cases. If there were the Observer would be printing it in bright red ink and blowing up my e-mail inbox with that information.
Edit: Removed comment, but I can't recreate from county data the numbers they are coming up with.  Edit 2: County Data here:  [https://www.mecknc.gov/news/Pages/Mecklenburg-County-COVID-19-Data-for-May-10.aspx](https://www.mecknc.gov/news/Pages/Mecklenburg-County-COVID-19-Data-for-May-10.aspx)
You know what else is mathematically a 200% increase? 3 vs 1... let’s focus on absolute numbers and not percentages please
Look at Iredell too. These people are crazy up here.
It'll happen. Bars and restaurants and cook outs. Just takes one person to spread it to a dozen.  And never mind dying ... Just getting sick, even if you don't need the hospital, you'll feel like you're dying.
Ehhhhh, plenty of non-Fox viewers here in Charlotte not taking it seriously as well.... and our population density is much higher.   Home Depot, Lowes, Grocery Stores, greenways, etc. are all PACKED and well below 50% are wearing masks and practicing social distancing. I think the scene in Rowan County is basically the scene everywhere.
I live in Rowan too and have seen the same sadly.
That's what I'm afraid of.
You're on the Charlotte subreddit. Most people here "live in the Charlotte area".
That's Mecklenburg County. The CBSA Summary (page 5 of the report) lists Charlotte as a location to watch.
Think it’s obtained not released officially
Leave the context out of this. Use your *feelings*
And even then a lot of the same people still won't listen. Most of the people who live around me were never social distancing in the first place.
When it comes to coronavirus, Charlotte's got a lot
We’re always #1
And make us world class!  FINALLY!
I fully expected to test positive for antibodies.   I work with the general public on a daily basis. I went to Japan in November, and got very sick there. Since we're now finding out this was around before December, I assumed there was at least a chance that I may have had it in Japan. That coupled with the sheer volume of people I interact with on a daily due to my job, I figured I could also have gotten it recently and been asymptomatic.   My test came back the next day negative for antibodies.
>folks are protected (if the science is correct)  I'm sorry but has something changed in the last few weeks? Last I heard WHO was scolding country's for assuming that you build immunity from exposure. Especially since we've seen repeat cases in China. As far as I know there's no science involved.
I think because there's such a concentration of young adults here who are all about the nightlife. I can't begin to tell you the amount of people I've seen clamoring to go back out to the bars, etc. It's the culture here.  I'm not touching a bar for the first three weeks or so they're open.   So many people are going to spread this but are so impatient to get back to their "status"

Yeah, so does that mean CLT is removed from the Meck county datas? That's why I'm confused. Should Meck be higher if there biggest city is at 286% increase?   Not arguing just legit don't understand the discrepancy between the two
Still have trouble seeing how meck is 0% vs while Charlotte is at 268% increase. Not trying to be political. Trying to understand the data.
Still have trouble seeing how meck is 0% vs while Charlotte is at 268% increase. Not trying to be political. Just trying to understand the data. Which is from the same report.  Maybe CLT was removed from the rest of the county?
I updated my original post for more clarity. CLT has more cases than Meck per the report. Maybe they excluded then from there rest of the county?  And to your first point, probably not
The datat is from the same report. I edited my original comment. Only thing I can think of it's that the CLT is removed from the rest of the county.
You really think it’ll take that long?  Genuinely curious not flaming.
Just in time for hurricane season to ramp up!
Memorial day is gonna put us back into a second wave by mid June imho.
how'd all the south carolina restaurants get away with full patios on mothers day?
The “stay at home” order is still in place with a slight relaxation for some commerce with the idea that you buy what you need and get back home.  And when out of home, you take caution by wearing masks,wash hands, etc.
I think this is part of the problem. The stay at home order was not lifted, but restrictions on businesses have been relaxed.
I see a bunch of downward trends, looks good.
It feels like I have alone lost my mind, I'm the only one wearing a face mask in Mooresville. Get it together people
My wife tested negative for antibodies yesterday, we figured she would be positive. I work in Uptown and she was sick with similar (albeit fairly mild) symptoms in December. A little disappointed to be honest, was hoping we were positive and could therefore get back on with our lives.
This is far from making the direct conclusion that those who were infected previously cannot become reinfected, but it does show that the "reinfection" cases that were initially reported in South Korea were, in fact, false positives (potentially caused by "dead" virus cells, but not conclusive there yet, either). https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-southkorea-explain/explainer-south-korean-findings-suggest-reinfected-coronavirus-cases-are-false-positives-idUSKBN22J0HR  So, yeah, we shouldn't assume that you have immunity, but it does seem likely that you do once you've already been infected. So, some potentially good news, at least.
It would be very unusual if exposure and recovery did not confer immunity.  It's *possible* that it doesn't, but the science of virology, immunology, etc., would say that is highly unlikely.  What is much less well understood is *how long* immunity will/would last.    The WHO has pointed out that no one has proved anything one way or the other, which is also true.
Repeat cases are pretty rare and I read somewhere that the experts think they're likely due to false negatives (ie someone is positive, tests negative but actually still had it, and then tests positive again--they didn't recover and get it again, they just never recovered in the first place)
Basically they have shown in monkeys that this specific corona virus strain does provide some immunity m.  They got the monkeys sick, then let them recover and then re exposed and they did not catch it again.  In most cases where someone tests negative for the virus testing agin in two weeks caused a positive in a statistically significant number.  Have to track down the report but some thing like 40% in the study. That’s on actually being sick.  So the first point to consider is that if your doing a swab you could be exposed but not have enough of the virus shedding to test positive yet.  People are most contagious lmrighr before the symptoms get bad it seems (if they get bad).  The second test for the blood you body takes time to build the antibodies so a lot of this is timing.  They say don’t get the blood test u til you think you are well past having been sick.  There is a really good article on this I will find that explains some of this much better then I can.  But that’s my understanding
What I meant by that statement was more in regards to the test rather than reinfection and true immunity.  And I agree with the folks below. The WHO ( as well as most other scientists and researchers) just don't have enough information to say one way or another.
Repeat cases? Good grief! Imagine being the guy who caught it twice.
Thanks!
For sure, I’m confused too lol but the increase **is** listed, just on another chart
Just guessing here but I doubt numbers are even being tracked at Charlotte level. The graph is probably referring to Meck and Charlotte as the same metro area.   Meck is not 0%. I just did a quick calculation in a spreadsheet and we had 400 cases in the week ending yesterday and 242 the week before. Of course, every 7-day interval is going to be a bit different, but clearly, the numbers are going up and are not flat in Meck.   Here are some totals: 4/28/20	27 4/29/20	48 4/30/20	60 5/1/20	24 5/2/20	48 5/3/20	25 5/4/20	10 Total	242 	 5/5/20	24 5/6/20	92 5/7/20	72 5/8/20	67 5/9/20	54 5/10/20	31 5/11/20	60 Total	400
If you look at the actual data from Mecklenberg posted on Mecklenberg's website, both the Meck data and by extension Charlotte data appear to be complete and utter crap. The highest number of new cases reported in a seven day period is the last 7 days, and that was 400 for Mecklenberg as a whole, including Charlotte.
It probably shouldn't, but it will. People will be even more resistant to the idea a second time around.
I think so. The seriousness of this virus was known in December/January and the shit hit the fan causing us to quarantine, April. So that's 4-5 months.  Sure many of us are taking the rules seriously masks and washing hands. But many are not. If everything stays as is then August seems right to me.  But I'm not a medical expert and it's just observation on my part
Rhetorically of course, I wonder how many mom-n-pop restaurant cooks consider it a violation of Their Constitutional Freedom [sic] to have to wear a hairnet or a beardnet in the kitchen.
I have no idea what's going on down in South Carolina, and it's only a half-hour drive from here.  NC is 10M people, 15,000 cases, 500 deaths (3% of cases, 50/1M capita)  SC is 5M people, 7,800 cases, 350 deaths (4.5% of cases, 70/1M capita)  I am grieved, of course, that NC had these raw numbers for any reason at all. But I'm intrigued that SC has higher deaths per capita and higher case mortality, with overall lower population density and fewer large cities. I guess they got away with that as a statewide Going Out Of Business Sale.
Does that go for people who are working at the establishments?   I went to pickup takeout yesterday and nobody in the restaurant was wearing a mask. None of the staff, nor the customers that came in to pickup (except us). Asked an employee if they weren’t required to wear masks and they said “ it’s a personal choice”. We won’t be going back there any time soon.
IIRC immunity for the other coronaviruses only lasts a year or two.
This, absolutely.  WHO has definitely been doing a lot of CYA lately.  Basically, some sort of message of unless something has been definitively proven, don't believe it, which is not especially helpful.  The main reason people keep getting the "annual" flu is that there are a lot more strains and it mutates more quickly.  The nature of coronaviruses is that they don't mutate as fast, and the mutations are more like "flavors", where the body would still recognize it.
Although there were some reports a few weeks ago about repeat cases in other countries, the, more recent stories that I've seen have said further investigation suggests inaccuracies with tests. I think most doctors for the moment still believe you can't actually catch it twice.
Right now it's typically the doctors and nurses, but yeah while it was in community spread some people got it. Got better. Went to the grocery store and had it again.  ~~But Georgia can open up restaurant dining rooms without any consequences~~
https://imgur.com/a/W645w2j and that's the CLT data. This is why I'm confused. Only way to explain is CLT was removed from the rest of the country
I guess you can twist the data however you want, but May 3-5 look like extreme outliers on the low end side, and May 6-7 look like extreme outliers on the high end side.  To me, it looks like more of a testing and/or test reporting catch up than some kind of huge dip and then spike.  If you smooth that, then yes, Meck is arguably flat over the last 14 days, particularly since the data for today just posted is 14.  Since the May 6-7 spike, it is easy to see not just a flattening but a decline.  Will be very interesting seeing the next couple of days.
Thank you for the due diligence!
And third, and fourth, and fifth. Until we realize this is something we will have to deal with and live with responsibly.  We can't stay at home until nothing bad happens anymore.  Having 20% of the state indefinitely unemployed is not a tenable solution.
yeah, but in December/January, it largely wasn't here yet. The first US case wasn't until Jan 21, and community transmission doesn't pick up for another month. In March we finally start seeing shut downs and stay at homes.    The big difference now is *it's already here* and active, so if/when there's a Quarantine Part II, it'll be a hell of a lot sooner that August.
The protestors aren’t mad that they can’t go to work they are mad they can’t get their services from people who are below them. The signs didn’t say “I wanna cut hair” the signs said “I want my haircut”. The people who I know protested still had their jobs either via work from home or factory work.   The same people who say working at McDonalds is only for entry level work and that they don’t deserve a living wage want them to make sure they can get their McDouble.
Tell me what restaurant so I can be sure to stay away.
It is supposed to be.
That's long enough to get back to work and figure this out.
Well, I agree that the day-to-day variation is high. So, I don't think it makes sense to draw too many conclusions from just a few days. However, local leaders have done just that, by talking about being flat without having solid evidence to back that up. Furthermore, we are reopening without having a compensation strategy. We are in a marginally better position now than a month ago because of more testing but still have no comprehensive tracing strategy. Testing has limited value without scaling up tracing as well. Also, mask wearing is still inadequate. Increasingly, the evidence is clear that everybody should be wearing a mask in enclosed spaces, at least, in places where elderly are forced to visit like grocery stores. So, we are reopening without putting in place other mitigation strategies.
Most public health experts I've read/heard have said re-imposition of quarantine measures is REALLY difficult. Honestly I think that in any "second wave" things will have to get even worse than the spring peaks (in what terms I don't know - deaths, full ICUs) before authorities will try quarantines again.
Mellow Mushroom off Selwyn - got takeout there and the woman bringing food out wasn't wearing a mask.
I'm in 5-10 restaurant kitchens a day, and I can tell you that even if the front house people are wearing masks, the back house staff damn sure aren't.  I've yet to see a single mask in the hundreds of kitchens I've gone into since this mess started.
Thanks.

Report: FBI serves warrant on Burr in investigation of stock sale during coronavirus outbreak

Curious if this is related to the fact that his brother in law also was found to have sold stock at the same time. The article says that they took his phone. He couldn't have been dumb enough to text "Hey bro sell stock covid=😬".... could he?  Anyways, I'm sure that absolutely nothing will come out of this, because that's how things go for people in power...
The FBI doesn’t care, Burr just broke ranks and this is punishment
The “Oh shit I actually got caught being a greedy bastard” face.
Missing context is what is his whole portfolio. My guess is that was most of it, but that's an important piece of information that I haven't seen reported. I'm going to guess his portfolio isn't worth $500MM.
I forget, does Donald think the FBI is fair or corrupt this week? It's hard to keep track of which investigations are crime-fighting and which ones are political retaliation anymore. I guess we'll know after the FBI does or does not serve warrants on Loeffler.
This is the Republican party. They only have care for themselves and their rich friends. Stop voting for them, they prove to be the same corrupt assholes that take care of themselves. What more do you need to see? Americans are dying and the President has no plan and just keeps fucking whining about Obama this, impeachment that. For fuck sake he is a crying bitch who can't think of anything but himself while your grandmother and parents die. 3.5 years he is president and all he can do is blame everyone else. Fucking do something. Do your job. Stop fucking tweeting and get us supplies that we need. We are reaching great depression levels of  unemployment and there is no national strategy. What the fuck has he accomplished in all this time besides tax breaks for the rich, a few miles of wall and stealing millions by holding and holding events at his own properties? Not shit. He has done nothing but bitch as a leader. Surrounded by other corrupt assholes sucking him off for pennies on the dollar.
The FBI is now investigating Feinstein as well since her husband dumped a bunch.  No matter the party, corruption must be heavily punished.  Any elected official that abuses the public trust should face execution as treason to their country.
Not defending what Burr did, because I think its very scummy to do one thing and tell your constituents something contrary, but this is retaliation for the Mueller report clear as day. I'm very worried about what is happening to the rule of law in this country. Going after Burr while dismissing Flynn? Shady as all hell.
Lock am up
Please, stop. I can only get so erect.
Good riddance to this ass clown.
scum
Even without that making moves based on intelligence briefings is barred on the stock act. Which Barr was one of three senators to vote against. This guy is a corrupt scum bag.
The investigation will be muddied and slowed, then he'll eventually resign after Sept 4th so we can't have an election and Cooper has to appoint one of the Republican nominees.
He probably assumed he wouldn't get caught. People get caught in dumb ways though.
I’m curious to see if this is related to his input on the Senate Intel report that found that Russia worked to sway the election. It seems retaliatory because other senators did the same thing and haven’t been served with a warrant yet. Just some food for thought and it isn’t above Burr’s morals to do such a thing
The fact that he has supported every regressive policy of the current administration and works daily for the benefit of his rich donors while screwing over the middle class will be why I will vote against him this year.
You rebel!
I like to call him Sen Shillis.
You're not wrong, but he still deserves whatever's coming to him.  It's just a shame Loeffler won't be held to the same standard considering.
Initial reporting said he sold around 60% of his net worth, I'm not sure of the veracity of that claim.
*insert “OBAMAGATE” tweet here*
What possible relevance does it have?
I mean, fuck her too.
You mean that Burr didn't violate the STOCK act?
I believe it's because as a sitting NC senator he directly represents all the citizens of Charlotte in the most important legislative body of the federal government.
I haven't checked my map lately but I do believe Charlotte is in NC and burr is a politician in NC. But don't quote me on it
I wonder how a Senator from NC could be relevant to NCs largest city!!?
I’d imagine Charlotte being the largest city in North Carolina has something to do with it...
> This guy is a corrupt scum bag.  Just ... add him to the pile.  Absolutely crazy.
The fact that he supports open corruption at all levels of government because his side is the one doing it is my problem with the guy.
Dont forget the ever growing working class
"You know what he did. It's been going on for a very long time."
If you want a profanity-laced explanation of some of the other factors in this investigation, look [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/gjdjf9/fbi_serves_search_warrant_on_sen_richard_burr/fqkfedw/).
Agree with all the above. Just want to add that Cal Cunningham is also a REALLY good candidate. My excitement to vote for him is equal to my wanting to send Tillis to retirement.
What a load. If he broke the law, he should be held accountable, regardless of party affiliation. And he wasn’t the only Congressman who sold stock so let them all account.
You're wrong bud. That's now how the US Senate works. They are voted in by a statewide vote and represent the entire state.
He's a Senator.  He represents the entire state.  Maybe learn about what you're taking about before spewing uninformed bullshit.
It's not "pure politics", he's our senator, and he committed a crime, that's well worth discussing. If Roy Cooper did this, I'd want to see it in this sub too.
He's a dirty politician...this is good news
He is a senator. Not a state senator, but an actual member of the US Senate. Every state has 2 senators. He represents us regardless of where you live in North Carolina. If you live in Charlotte you still get to vote for him or whoever is running for Senate. What’s so hard to understand about this concept?
How many times are you gonna copy/paste the same incorrect take on this?
I definitely like Cal as well.  I'm excited about the new generation of leaders that are stepping up like him and Jeff Jackson.
>he committed a crime  I'm just going to point that he hasn't even been charged with a crime yet, and certainly not convicted of anything. That may change, but yes, this is pure politics in the sense that articles like these will serve to convict him in the court of public opinion even if he is totally exonerated.
Agreed! The future of NC is very, very bright
I never said that serving a warrant is not factual, nor did I say the reporting wasn't factual.    Would you be willing to exonerate Burr if no charges are filed or will you still consider him guilty no matter what?  Further,  why report on this at all until charges are file and/or the case settled in court? Warrants were issued and served in the Clinton email case too. Do you believe her guilty because she was investigated?

/u/jeffjacksonnc's grandfather passed away from coronavirus
This is awful. Love that guy.  he's done as much or more during this pandemic ad any politician I've seen . Send him some good thoughts/messages/prayers if you can
I just saw that on Twitter. Really awful for him and his family. We are thinking of you, Senator Jackson, and all of the families affected by coronavirus.
I use /u/jeffjacksonnc as an example of politicians communicating and caring for the actual people they represent. To hear this tragedy has befallen he and his family breaks my heart. Sincere condolences for the whole family. God speed senator.
While any loss of life from this thing is awful, this news is especially tough to hear. Keeping /u/jeffjacksonnc , his family, and all of our leaders in my thoughts and prayers.
Awful news. Thinking of you and your family.
My condolences to Mr. Jackson and his family.
Praying for you & your family, Senator Jackson.
So sorry to hear! Condolences to the family.
Sorry to hear. He’s been my go-to guy for local news (and sanity). Thoughts with him and his family
My condolences family
I sent him a message, he’s doing an incredible job and I really appreciate it
Oh my, what sad news. Thinking of you and your family during this difficult time, Senator Jackson.
Sending my condolences & love to you /u/jeffjacksonnc
Nooooo!! Jeff is the man and I hate to hear him hurt.... 🤦🏽‍♀️
I’m so sorry, Senator.
Sad day
u/jeffjacksonnc I hope you’re given the time to grieve your loved one. I know your fight for our safety will reflect in your love for your grandfather. I’m so sorry for your & your family’s loss. I hope you know that your actions have put so many of us in your corner and you’re feeling the love we’re pouring out to you. I hope you can reflect on your love for your grandfather and give him the rest he needs with the love he deserves. Blessings.
Very sad, he’s one of the greats our state has to offer and has done more for us in this time than many. Sorry to hear about this, use it as a reminder about the people we’re fighting for.
I'm so sorry.
Aw so sad to hear, my condolences to him and his loved ones.
/u/jeffjacksonnc , my heart goes out to you. May God watch over you and your family and help you find peace again.
Condolences to you and your loved ones.
Jeff has been the gold standard for politicians/public servants during this time, keeping us so well informed. Sen. Jackson, we're very sorry for your loss.

Coronavirus in Charlotte: Are people wearing masks in stores? We went to 75 to find out

Everyone in Super G Mart had a mask today. Every single person.
Just went to Harris teeter. 100 percent of employees had masks, almost none of the customers did.
Last time I went to Food Lion, the cashier looked at my mask and told me "those face masks don't work you know, they actually suppress your immune system. That's why I stopped wearing mine." She then went on to tell me, "This virus has been around for years. Don't believe me, check the back of a Lysol can!"  I'm not sure I'm going back to that Food Lion anytime soon.
Today I went to the Harris Teeter in Plaza-Midwood and the Food Lion on Plaza. Harris Teeter, maybe 25% wearing masks. Food Lion was the inverse, about 25% not wearing. This has been pretty consistent. For fuck's sake, it's such a minor freaking inconvenience. Wear a goddamn mask! It's such a middle finger to common decency and listening to people whine about wearing them just sounds childish.
I went to the abc store with my mask on. Then i had to head to the gas station which was very close. I didn't take my mask off. The clerk at the gas station gave me a hard time for wearing my mask in my car. "Are you worried about catching the virus in your car?" I just told them its easier to keep on. It's just interesting that there alot of people that still dont take this seriously
I’ve been out a few times and have seen a good number with masks on but not covering their nose. Thanks for trying I guess? 🤷‍♀️😐
It sucks cause I work in a grocery store, I know the answer is mostly “no” for customers even though most (like mine) are enforcing mandatory masks for all employees. Even had customers tell me they don’t believe this is real at all to my (masked) face lol
Most places that I go I see about 80-85 percent of people wearing masks.
I approve of media that has decided it is a good idea to provide coronavirus coverage to the public free of charge. Click the link to determine if the observer agrees.
Serious note, where do you buy masks or is it all DIY now?
Majority of customers at Trader Joe’s are without masks.  It’s astounding.  I’d wager the large majority are of one political persuasion which is consistently anti-science and pro-“me”
My wife and I are wearing masks when we go out. We’re considerate like that, because network one of knows if we might have been exposed in recent days.
Who is selling masks locally that I could buy. I would like custom if possible. I know I’m asking for a lot. For doesn’t hurt to ask. But I would like to buy local is possible.
Charlotte Observer should do a follow-up story, surveying why people are not wearing masks.   My guess is that this an education issue more than anything. People are not informed about the effectiveness of masks and the fact that their primary purpose is to protect other people, not the wearer. If people were informed, I'm confident that the vast majority of people would comply out of respect for others.
I was just at BJs at Mooresville a few hours ago and most employees had masks (apart from 1 I think) and 80% of shoppers had masks on
Between Harris Teeter, Publix, Food Lion, and Target: Cotswold HT & Publix = most masks I’ve seen on customers and employees. Matthews HT (across from Target) = same as Cotswold.   Target (Stonecrest & Midtown) = seems like 50/50, but I’ve only been to each location one time since this all started.   Food Lion (Sardis/Monroe Rd) = the absolute worst. Employees wearing nothing, maybe 1 will have a mask or gloves. Majority of the customers have zero protection.   Cotswold HT has various masks and some hand sanitizer for sale. First I’ve seen yet.
Not wearing a mask in a store is the new smoking in a restaurant.
WEAR YOUR FUCKING MASKS.   I'm tired of being nice about it, you jackholes. We get vaccinated in the same way; to protect ourselves but everyone else as well.
the number of people that ask why I am wearing one is even more frightening to me.
Where are you supposed to get a mask?
When you know people that have had it, or people close to those around you have died, or you know doctors working at our COVID unit at the hospital in Charlotte, you quickly learn this is not fake .. this is not a hoax .. this is not limited to old people .. this really has nothing to do with Trump or politics .. it’s fucking dead ass serious. I wear my mask even though I’m protecting all the retards that aren’t, and unfortunately I see most people are not wearing masks. At this point if that is YOU, you’re a piece of a shit.
I wish that part of this phase-open process required people to wear masks (obviously delving deeper into specifics of that, but I’m just putting out an overall and sweeping wish.
Sadly not that I’ve seen. :(   People seem to only care about themselves.
I went to publix in fort mill today.  The one person I saw without a mask was that jerk going the opposite directions down the aisles.   I guess rules and suggestions just don’t apply to him.
Media running out of things to report on.
Thats a baller clientele.
Super G has always been good like this since this began. Tons of immigrant and asian shoppers that don't have complexes about whether or not a mask makes them look foolish.
That's impressive really... most stores I've been to you see maybe 25% of customers and employees, at most.
Went to Harris Teeter the other day - a staggering amount of staff weren't wearing their masks properly. Cashiers with masks pulled down under their chin, guy in the deli had his nose hanging out, etc.  Not all costumers were wearing masks, the ones that were wore them correctly, though.
Have been noticing this for a while. Coincidentally we’ve noticed the “nicer” Harris teeter, Publix types places have less customers wearing masks. While Aldi and Food lion have most customers wearing masks...  Just put them on people. We’ve been in worst conditions during world wars and natural disasters. This shouldn’t be any different. This is a pretty mild and easy thing to do. Ffs.
GOOD
A coworker tried the same thing on me before lockdown. Apparently they can’t grasp the fact that there is more than one Coronavirus.
I was at the Food Lion in Lake Wylie about a week ago and no employees were wearing masks, none of them were wearing gloves (which I know the efficacy of is very debatable but still), and no social distancing measures were being enforced in the slightest. The only sign of anything other than business as usual were some pathetically small shelf signs below most people's field of vision telling you which direction the aisle's traffic was supposed to flow in and NO ONE was acknowledging them. My family were the only ones in masks. It's so frustrating knowing that I'm protecting them and they don't care at all about protecting me 🙄
Based on the Food Lion cashier’s observations, perhaps she is a virologist or pulmonary MD.   ;)    /s
/r/thathappend for $500 Alex
Food Lion in my neighborhood has always been a little sketchy, which is why we funny go there .... Lol.
That’s why she works at Food Lion.
The cotswold teeter this morning had like 95% with masks on. I was pleasantly surprised!
You were right to keep wearing it. To be most effective, you should always wash your hands before putting the mask on and before taking it off!
I can imagine it's especially frustrating for grocery store workers, because you are essentially being forced to take unnecessary risks to make a living. Kudos to Costco for making masks mandatory. It seems to  me that grocery stores on the one place where masks really need to be mandatory because people of all ages and vulnerabilities have no choice but to go there. Everybody needs food and neither workers nor customers should be forced into a risky situation in order to get food.
The USA has a third of all deaths around the world and they think this is a hoax? Some people have serious issues with reality.
Yes?  They are offering all Corona-related articles free and have been since the start.
A lot of people are DIYing it , but I was able to purchase some from amazon this week so I dont have to keep relying on my disposables. I'm sure there are folks on Facebook that are supplying them as well if you have access to that.
The Target in Stonecrest had 10 packs of masks available on the main aisle. In case anyone needs them. It was a huge display.
I got a pack from here recently https://radianjeans.com/
https://www.etsy.com/shop/FirelightFashions  https://www.etsy.com/shop/FatLadysSong
Please buy your mask locally from someone making it or at least from someone making them on etsy or a craft site, for some people this is one of the few things that will sell right now to supplement their income.
Old Navy sells them.
Check out the smaller hardware stores. Monroe Hardware and Renfrow have fabric masks sourced from local companies.
Yep I'm in Mt Holly and it is the tale of two food lions, one the majority is wearing the mask the other the minority of people have mask on.
No, just lazy.
these shipped from concord when I bought one -- quick & very solid quality https://www.etsy.com/shop/GammaRaeCrafts
There was a lady set up in a tent in the field next to the Food Lion at 237 Mt. Holly Huntersville Rd today. They were 2/$15 and well made.
That seems a very optimistic view. I get eye rolls and jokes about paranoia from maskless strangers when I go out in a mask for essential items. "Respect for others." Not sure we have as much of that as you hope.
> I'm confident that the vast majority of people would comply out of respect for others  Oh sweet child.  We need more people like you.  But most aren't.
That would be my gut feeling as well, but honestly who hasn't heard enough about masks at this point? You've got to be *trying* not to know.
I wish I was as optimistic as you about people wearing masks if they realized it would help everyone else.  I feel like a lot of people just don't care or they only wear them because they think they protect them.   Had an old man call me unAmerican for wearing a mask yesterday when I was getting takeout and I get a lot of glares and eye rolls when I go shopping with a mask on.

“Respect for others”. Lol. No. This is America. People are happy to shove a constitution in your face and laugh at anyone who dares to bother to don a mask.
I would guess it's more just that "not wearing a mask" is the default option. Sure you have small, vocal pockets of people who are assholes about it. But the majority of people are either lazy or simply don't care and aren't going to wear masks unless they are mandated.  I personally think people should be required to wear masks when in public indoor spaces, but we live in a country and state that values individual choice/freedom more than pretty much anything so it's almost certainly not going to happen.
Wearing them and rebreathing my own air makes me dizzy and sick. But I wear it when required.
Not education, lack of respect and empathy. Doing things for the ‘common good’ isn’t an American notion anymore. it’s all ‘me, me, me’.
Non-N95 masks are fairly easy to get now. I've seen them in stores and online. Or they aren't that hard to make. Most are washable. So, you just need a few.  Again, these masks are designed simply to reduce the radius of droplet spread so that an asymptomatic person is less likely to infect others around them. It's a no-brainer...unless, of course, you want to live in lockdown indefinitely?
Any kind of face covering works. Doesn't have to be a mask.  There are local businesses selling masks, people are selling homemade masks on NextDoor / Facebook, there are tutorials on YouTube for no sew masks made from tshirts, you can just tie a scarf around your face. Doesn't matter. There's no excuse not to have a face covering of some sort.
I’ve gotten them (just regular surgical masks) on both Amazon and Walmart.com recently.
I've seen local people selling them on facebook, you can order online again, you can fashion your own out of household items if you need to. The mask is to help protect other people from your droplets, with the idea that if we all do it, we can decrease the overall amount of infected grossness floating around.
The supply is getting back to normal around me. Target had "single use" masks like a dollar a piece in a 10 pack
https://radianjeans.com/ has a cheaper offer than a lot of places. nextdoor, facebook, and etsy all have a ton of choices too
Relax Francis
I’m actually curious about this as someone who is trying to decide if I want to venture back out into stores.
Yeah, accidentally killing yourself or your loved ones looks way more foolish for sure.
Well if you want to go to a Harris teeter that is taking this seriously. The one on Idlewild and Margaret Wallace had them all wearing masks.
During my Wal-Mart run this morning 100% of employees and about 70% of customers were wearing masks. The only people not wearing masks were little kids and gruff middle-age dads
My wife and I made the same observations about certain areas of town...
> Have been noticing this for a while. Coincidentally we’ve noticed the “nicer” Harris teeter, Publix types places have less customers wearing masks. While Aldi and Food lion have most customers wearing masks  I hate to go here but I do feel like anecdotally the more wealthy crowd feels more "entitled" or "privileged" and have decided they don't want to "deal with this" anymore.
Costco is requiring and handing out free masks. Also the Asian grocery stores have been my go to since Corona started, they require masks now but even before that I'd say 90% of shoppers had them. New Asia is taking everyone's temperature before they go inside.
But much freedums!  /s  Free to go shop elsewhere.  Three family members working in grocery stores and wearing masks every shift. Annoying but safer.
gOoD
I'm impressed you made it out of there alive. Every time I've visited that place it's been a mad house.
I'm amending my observation this morning, because I'm here at the plaza HT at 10:30 am and almost everyone is wearing a mask. I imagine people willing to get up and beat the crowds are also more conscientious when it comes to wearing masks.
I've been having issues with my mask fogging up my sunglasses when I drive. It's the main reason I've been taking it off while driving. Otherwise I would leave it on.
I work at a Lowe's Foods, and all of our stores have a mask policy in place for employees, even those that may stay mostly in the back. We even have signs up whenever you first walk in asking for everyone to wear masks but a solid 60% don't, just going off of what I see day to day
Thats good. This one isn't (for me at least!)
> I get eye rolls and jokes about paranoia from maskless strangers when I go out in a mask for essential items.   This is pretty much what he is saying. The strangers don't believe that the disease is a spreadable as it is, or they don't believe that the masks are as effective as they are, which is why they would call you paranoid
When's the last time you saw someone fart in a grocery store? 99% of people have been socialized to act politely towards others in public. The problem is that people don't understand that not wearing a mask is worse than farting.
Yeah, but they don't understand that a large percentage of spread is by people who have no symptoms who are transmitting droplets through the air over a significant distance.   If people realized there was a small but real possibility they could be sick without knowing and putting an elderly person's life in danger, why would they not wear a mask?  Also, I think people have trouble thinking in the aggregate, that not wearing a mask is essentially contributing to a public health crisis that is causing widespread social and economic upheaval.
Well, I think social media is largely responsible for a break down in access to reliable, trustworthy information. For all we know, the Russians could be perpetrating disinformation about mask wearing. It is a huge problem, but I think it has more to do with lack of good quality information than anything about the goodness or badness of human nature.  Also, I think we need to take another lesson from the Nazis, as uncomfortable as that makes people feel. Were the majority of Germans in that time period truly evil or just seriously confused and manipulated by fear?  Political ideology can spiral out of control in ways that become culturally suicidal. For example, we now see fringe members of the Republican party making death threats against public health officials like Fauci for simply conveying scientific advice. This occurs when a political culture reaches such a high level cognitive dissonance that people start to do things that are essentially insane, like kill millions of people for no rational reason.  This political virus is just a big a threat as the coronavirus. Ultimately, I do believe that it all comes down to access to information. The Nazis were masters at disinformation, and we see similar things happening today, facilitated by social media.
> It's a no-brainer....unless of course, you actually don't have one.  Fixed.
I’m wearing my P100 respirator (with surgical mask cutout over the exhale port on the inside) for the foreseeable future.
Username checks out.
Venture back out but follow precautions - mask and social distancing.
I noticed this at Wal-mart too. Seems odd to see a mom wearing a mask and her kids not.
I’m happy you went there. Kinda shows the disparity between the wealthier and the regular folk. Poorer people probably are more worried about getting infected for financial reasons or because they may be the only source of income for a family. While wealthier folks probably think they’re are fine because they have healthcare and or life insurance. That very well may play into the reason why they fee more entitled not to wear protection.   If I’m right then that has to be the dumbest reasoning. The whole point of mask wearing is to protect others. So by ignoring that you can argue someone doesn’t give af about other people’s well being.   You may have hit the nail on the head.
That's a nice theory, but I've been going to stores in Ballantyne including Fresh Market, and everyone is wearing masks and gloves.  I would posit that wealthy people have the time and the resources to take proper precautions more so than others.
Likewise to you!
Haha fair! I think it was earlier enough I missed the pure chaos. That light at the Smashburger is the absolute worst when it backs up.
I know with NYT, you still have to have a free account, just no subscription needed. Maybe the Observer is the same way. I always just open in a private window anyway.
uBlock Origin allows me to view the observer without paying.
Respect for other people would include minding your business about what other people are wearing instead of making deprecating jokes at a stranger.
It isn't polite to loudly judge strangers for wearing a mask even if you think it's dumb. The problem is people are assholes.
Well you can’t see someone fart, but I’ve been in grocery stores and heard them.  Even smelled them.  Actually I’ve farted in a grocery store.
I hope you don’t let anyone fart with an open flame near your straw man argument there...
I was in target once and a guy farted so loud the back quarter section of the store heard it and laughed. Made my day. Not all heroes hold in farts.
I would/do fart in public 100% no fucks given
Unfortunately I think you're being too optimistic about people. Yes, probably, if someone authoritative had a one-to-one conversation with them, the "putting an elderly person's life in danger" play on their conscience might work. But I think most people are going to draw upon the long list of excuses ("I feel fine, no one I know has had it", "I'm not going to come into contact with any elderly people", etc.)
Well, if you are fed a steady diet of Fox News you’re gonna have a bad time. A very bad, misinformed and undereducated time.
I want to know where the international community is on this. I mean we have proven Russia is actively manipulating our media and public opinion. In what way is that not an act of war? It’s more manipulative than taking out murderous dictators...
You can easily google "homemade mask" and follow the thousands of simple tutorials. All you need is scissors and a t shirt for some.
> with surgical mask cutout over the exhale port on the inside  Did you read about this somewhere or did you just think of it yourself? Wondering since I hadn't thought of that and might do it too.
For sure! I was just responding to the person questioning the relevance of the article because for me, it’s very relevant. I want to know the state of the situation in stores.
Also, read a study a few years ago that as people become wealthier, they become less empathetic.
That damn chick fila across the street blocks traffic like a sonuvabitch also. Cotswold is crazy.
>Respect for other people would include minding your business about what other people are wearing   Am I taking crazy pills, or are half of the posts on this thread about judging what other people are wearing i.e. people who are not wearing masks? The time for 'minding our own business' has long passed
I wonder what the flatuquivalent of that guy who wore a swastika mask to the grocery would be. Dropping your pants in the middle of the aisle and trying to light it?
He who smelt ‘em dealt ‘em.
My Dad won't.  One day we were in a grocery store and he starts tugging on my shirt sleeve.  But won't say anything.  And I was all like stahhhhop.  I'm looking at this here back of chips.  Then he tugs again and starts to walk away.  Quickly.  Then it hit me.  I don't question him anymore when he tugs on my sleeve and we're out and about.
Well, as this drags on for months and death and sickness touches more people's lives, we will probably see a gradual shift in people's behaviors. Right now, I think there is a minority who see us heading back to normal, when in reality we are on a roller coaster ride.
Their response is always "then the elderly person should be staying home"
Or even a bandana or a t-shirt! There's really no excuse.
I read it somewhere, it’s the best of both worlds, idiots walking around everywhere with no masks so I can get protected from them by P100 filters but if I’m a carrier I can protect other people from myself with the surgical mask inside.
I mean, the data is true, despite what the fear mongering media would have you believe
A post on Reddit is not the same as approaching a stranger in public.
Agree. Once it starts affecting people they know it will stop being a fake pandemic.
Yep, it’s coming in a big way in about a month. The curve has been flattened but people won’t accept lockdowns a second time around, unfortunately.
If you are under the age of 40, without serious pre-existing health conditions, you are more likely to be struck by lightning than die of covid-19

Mecklenburg County coronavirus cases at 2,439, but no new deaths reported for 5 days

I just don't wanna get covid and go to the hospital and come out with an 80k bill.
Unfortunately, I know of 1 death confirmed this morning.
Somehow this will be turned evidence that the guidelines in place to slow the progress of COVID are bad. BUT MY FREEEDUMMM  Edit: a typo
Reddit doesn't want their unemployment benefits to end and have to go back to work.
Sorry to hear this.  How are you doing with it?
My condolences
I'm sorry for your loss.
My condolences if it was someone close.  Did they die of pneumonia or influenza, or something else?
I mean you misrepresenting the frustration...  How effective is the closure, can it be achieved with some level of freedom, what Is the point to stop all death(which isn’t even prioritised in normal society as we allow traffic accidents, consumption of alcohol, and etc) or to slow the spread to a hospitalization level our system can handle and it is a long term solution? These are all actual concerns with the current program.  Like I don’t think anyone thinks shutting everything down isn’t working, like obviously it’s stopping the vectors the virus can be spread.
I think once we start opening back up it will explode again, not just in the US but also maybe here. I hope resutrants and fast food places stay closed indoors.
We agreed to flatten the curve, not wait for a cure.  The country is being held hostage.
Fascist.
Pretty cool. I wonder if we could get this to work on a larger scale. Maybe for every illness?
If he had anyone's back he would have done all he & his administration could have to prevent the outbreak from spreading like it did instead of spouting nonsense on the daily and covering only part of hospital bills. I mean, this is the guy who said we'd get better healthcare than Australia (universal) and yet the GOP has still only taken healthcare insurance away from people since the passing of the ACA. Having your back would be doing what every other major country on Earth has done in guaranteeing all your citizens healthcare AND covering at least 75% of lost wages.
> Even if you don’t have coverage, you may not end up getting billed for all your treatment due to the Trump administration’s intention to partially reimburse providers for treating the uninsured.  But fuck those 35 million who lost their jobs, and therefore their insurance because of this
Thanks, it’s a lot to process, especially when it hits so closely.
Thank you
Thank you
What part of ‘confirmed’ didn’t make that clear? They tested positive for fucking COVID19, thanks for your questioning 🙄 Takes a special type of person to question the validity of someone’s claim during a fucking pandemic. Gain some empathy.
It's unfortunate that COVID has polarized people into arguing "for" or "against" reopening, when, in fact, we should be discussing "how" to reopen smartly. There's no question that the economic harm is a big part of this crisis,  I am in favor of allowing people to dine in outdoor spaces and shop with masks in places with low density. I'm even in favor of millennials  having their social gatherings if they feel it is worth the risk. Yes, they could spread the disease to elderly but they could also build immunity and take care of the elderly. It really comes down to being smart, through testing and tracing.  But we also need to be smart about restrictions. Masks should be mandatory in any public indoor space where people are forced to frequent like a grocery, drug or hardware store. Temperature checks should be mandatory. Testing and contact tracing need significantly more investment. That's the frustrating thing. We are wealthy country with a lot of innovation. It's frustrating that COVID is the one of the leading causes of death and real unemployment is probably over 20%. We should be capable of doing a lot better than this.  And efficiently maxing out our hospital capacity is not exactly a desirable solution either. That's a lot of dead people. We also need to consider that many people are postponing other care and will eventually cause a surge, and once flu season hits, that will also compete with hospital beds. So, we really need to get our shit together and be smarter about controlling this virus.  The fact that we are still even debating masks is a sign of our ineptitude, something that is relatively uncontroversial among experts.
But, I also think you are misrepresenting the solution.  >what Is the point to stop all death  Nobody suggested that we are going to stop all COVID deaths. People need t o stop saying that governments are suggesting we aren't going to open until COVID is gone.  >to slow the spread to a hospitalization level our system can handle and it is a long term solution?  Yes, this is the long term solution. If hospitals are overrun with COVID patients they aren't able to deal with other illnesses as well. We also can't have bodies stacked up in trailers and act like this was the proper route to take.  >Like I don’t think anyone thinks shutting everything down isn’t working, like obviously it’s stopping the vectors the virus can be spread.  A lot of people are suggesting this. Like a lot. Mostly right wing outlets. Also friends/family of mine (all right wing). Somehow this has become a political issue.
I don’t think I’m misrepresenting it at all. Just read the comments in this sub any time COVID comes up. That’s not to say there are NO reasons to question the effectiveness of the current plan, but those are clearly not the people I’m targeting
But people need to get their haircuts NOW dammit!
No it won’t. People develop immunity. Chances are a lot more had been infected and recovered than confirmed cases out there.
By that logic, you're being held hostage if you sick and need a hospital bed.
Sure.
And who’s going to pay for it?
I’m very sure. Take care of yourself!
>Takes a special type of person to question the validity of someone’s claim during a fucking pandemic.  i'm sorry, what? lmao wtf kind of logic is this?
Lol
So in other words they didn’t die because of COVID, they died from something else it since they had it the hospital will now get extra funding. Very few die from Covid itself, it’s usually pneumonia or influenza that really kills them.
I went out to a shop (by appointment) today and was the only one wearing a mask. Drove by outdoor ice cream parlors and again, no masks. Wearing a mask isn’t hard! Ugh.
I think the main reason it's spreading the way it is relates to poor personal hygiene. Even if everyone wears masks, thatI doesn't discount the fact they likely didn't wash their hands after driving to the grocery store. People pick up items and then put them on random shelves. Not everything gets wiped down every time someone touches something in the store. Employees aren't changing gloves between every customer they ring up, and I doubt they're cleaning conveyor belts between every customer. I've seen plenty of store employees and even customers alike wearing masks incorrectly or made of materials that really won't do anything.   My point is that it's unrealistic and not feasible to take every precaution out there. I also think most everyone is doing something incorrectly, whether they're not washing their hands correctly or enough, improper wear of face masks, etc. I agree with your post 100% about opening the economy intelligently. Unfortunately, the spread will continue simply because of human nature and the slow appearance of symptoms (incubation period).
Do you know how many people on here are saying we are opening too fast.  We are opening at the same pace as NY, without a global city and under 500 hospitalisations. At NY’s peak they had around 15k.  Obviously this has become partisan on both sides, with anecdotal stories from doctor Phil on fox and some random doctor on CNN ignoring nationwide statistics.
Everything is a political issue these days, it’s actually kind of scary.
Obviously but lapping them all together is kind of condescending.  Let’s compare, bad diet contributes to 700k deaths per year. Travel accidents are 35k. Also 100k for alcohol related deaths.  At what level of mortality do we open the society due to a Global Pandemic. These are legitimate questions which our public officials are ignoring.  Sources below... https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transportation_safety_in_the_United_States#Rural_vs_Urban  https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/brochures-and-fact-sheets/alcohol-facts-and-statistics  https://cspinet.org/eating-healthy/why-good-nutrition-important
Our testing has been and continues to be woefully inadequate. Anyone that wants to go back to some semblance of normal should see that.
How do we have more masks than we know what to do with if 3m can't even keep up with production? Show me where I can buy an N95 mask.
I cut my hair myself today. Turned out pretty nicely if I do say so. (Woman with shoulder length hair)
Thats under a false assumption people have that it spreads considerably faster than it actually does. Its a comfortable idea that you have immunity, but in reality you probably havent been exposed.. We sheltered and stopped the spread... then very suddenly opened up again. We didn't shelter and magically develop immunity.
We actually don’t know what immunity looks like for this virus or how long it lasts. People have been testing positive after being discharged from care with negative test results.
It's almost like the citizens of this country are already paying for all the healthcare, but through a convoluted system of payroll deductions, employer payments, complicated non transparent billing, debt collectors and government programs; all delivering poor outcomes and excessive cost due to said non value added middlemen, with innumerable stories of personal tragedy and failures of said system.
How are we going to fund the military? How do we fund the police departments, how did we fund those stupid letters the president made the treasury send after most people had already gotten their stimulus checks, telling them he was so nice and generous to approve us getting stimulus checks that cost upwards of 6 million dollars? All of the sudden you want accountability for the country’s budgeting choices?
I'd be willing for a combination of raising my income tax + receiving a fraction of what my employer subsidizes for insurance currently (the employer pockets the rest).   I'd pay less for healthcare than I do now, I'd pay for care directly as opposed to insurance, and my employer would have less overhead. A win for everyone (except those poor health insurance execs).
Imagine this:  * Your company stops paying a part of your healthcare cost and instead puts that money into your paycheck.  * You stop paying, premiums, deductibles, and what is n't covered by your insurance. * Billionaires pay a higher tax rate instead of hording wealth and extorting the poorest in the country to work for  $1,256.67 a month.  * That money is then put into healthcare for all in the country.   Imagine that you could start a small business without worrying about getting sick and it bankrupting you. Imagine being able to leave your job without worrying about getting sick and it bankrupting you. Imagine being able to have your kid play a sport without worrying if they get hurt and it bankrupting you.   The number one reason for bankruptcy in the United States is medical costs. How is that a good system?   We have the most expensive healthcare in the world because people who are uninsured can't pay medical bills and those costs are passed onto us. So, if the costs are passed onto us anyway, why don't we actually get something out of it?   But, hey we obviously cannot afford the cost as the richest nation in the world. We currently as a country spend 3.5 trillion on healthcare every year. The cost is not the issue.
I don't know what's on MSM television but sometimes talking points are talking points because they reflect reality. I also don't care what Biden or anyone else says about halting flights, it was a rare good move, but that doesn't negate the numerous poor moves or time of inaction when intelligence & science officials were sounding alarms while DT and crew were downplaying the pandemic or not taking the moves necessary (distributing equipment reserves, authorizing defense powers act). The fact that you have to resort to name calling making this partisan speaks volumes.
You do as well.
No one DIES of Covid.... People die from complications of having their immune system compromised by Covid.  No one dies of AIDS, they die of minor infections. No one dies of the flu, they die because of complications. This happens with many other diseases that are out there.
Yes, but the question is what level of spread can we live with, not how to stop it.
Studies show that breathing droplets is a more frequent form of transmission than through touch. That is also more problematic because it's outside of people's control. You have to breath. With touch, there are multiple layers of defense, gloves, sanitizer, washing, wiping, not touching your face, etc.  The point is to lower the rate of transmission statistically to the point where each infected person is infecting no more than one other person on average. Like you said, you are never going to prevent all transmission. However, if the rate is less than one consistently for a long period, it will eventually die out or stay at very low levels.   Obsessing about perfection is not fruitful, nor does it make sense to give up just because each protection method is imperfect.   Also, remember that a good chunk of sick people are reasonable enough to stay home if they are sick. And then as immunity builds that will lower the infection rate. We have to take a multipronged approach to bring the infection rate to less than 1.  And we have to do it strategically where we get your most bang for our buck.   A temperature check feels invasive and offensive but it really is a small inconvenience relative to the benefit. Masks are a bit more inconvenient but offer significant benefit statistically.   You read about companies doing a "deep clean" in their factories and offices. This is largely a waste of time. By the time, employes go back to work, the virus would have died anyway on most surfaces. Deep cleaning gives a false sense of security. Most touch-based spread is going to occur after one person touches an object and another touches it an hour later.  Yo can't constantly keep cleaning everything every minute. So, don't touch a doorknob and then touch your face. It's not that complicated.   On the other hand, getting on a train, bus, airplane, elevator or any small confined space with dense crowds is one of the most risky forms of behavior where you have very little control over your fate, especially if others aren't wearing a mask. Wearing a cloth mask is not going to protect you from others not wearing any mask. So, getting on a bus without a mask is a significant threat to other people around you.
> Do you know how many people on here are saying we are opening too fast.   I never said people were not saying this.   I was responding to you saying " Like I don’t think anyone thinks shutting everything down isn’t working, like obviously it’s stopping the vectors the virus can be spread. "
Bad diet cannot be spread through me sneezing on you and transmission because I did not wear a mask.     If you're going to make comparisons, you need a better example.
Honestly, I don’t care if I’m being condescending. I’m angry. Being condescending online seems like  a decent outlet.
Ya, honestly it’s insane that congress hasn’t passed more money for just testing...  I think the problem is dems don’t want to give it to the president and republicans don’t want to give it to the states. I wish they would just get over it.
Also money is just a tool for a government that can print, issue and collect its own currency at will. Even assuming that’s a fallacy, I’d rather have 1970 inflation than a 1930s economic crash.
Yeah but the scary thing is when you print new bills you devalue the already printed bills. Any increase in the money supply causes inflation and reduces purchasing power. Firms and business will only respond by increasing prices ON EVERYTHING. Some may say increasing the money supply is harmful in the short run but helps in the long run. However, there is no easy fix to anything like this but there are serious economic repercussions from “printing” new bills that a lot of people might be overlooking.
Money is a concept? Tell that to a starving Venezuelan. Debt matters. It will catch up to us eventually.
My wife cut mine today finally. Probably 2 pounds of hair gone. Turned out fairly decent. Head feels a lot better.
I bet it looks lovely!
With the virus ~18 months away, I think the only solution is herd immunity.
what
I would say that oversight for 6 million as a one time thing is a bit different than 8 trillion a year...
> I'd be willing for a combination of raising my income tax + receiving a fraction of what my employer subsidizes for insurance currently (the employer pockets the rest).  Then you, and everyone else who thinks like you, are free to get together and sign a contract, indicating that you will voluntarily pay into a pool to cover each other's medical bills when needed. Then you can leave the rest of us, who don't want that, out of it. Why force people that don't want your policies to suffer them when you can just make it voluntary?
The healthcare industry needs to drastically change before we can even attempt it.  The problem is most people just want to dump money at the people (read: *other people’s* money). We have to address the cost of healthcare and why the systems are set up this way.  Most of the proposed plans are just wealth redistribution under another name.
>	Billionaires pay a higher tax rate instead of hording wealth   I honestly don’t even know if they pay them at all lol. Would be nice if they just paid their damn taxes in the first place. Raise em? Sure!   Well done on a succinct explanation
“No one dies of covid... people die from having their immune system compromised by covid”  so which is it? Do they die from covid or not?
Oh that certainly is the right question to be asking, I don't disagree with you at all here. My point with my last post was more about the fact that people are getting hostile about things like some people not wearing masks and such. I think we're not 100% where we need to be as far as number of testing kits go in areas where many cases are expected. I do think though that we're closer to the point where we can better manage the severe cases that will come up without the system being overly burdened at least here in the Carolinas.
Ok, if people honestly believe that they are idiots.
Not really...  You can die of flu, do we stop people from going out for that? How about aids do we stop people from having intercourse?   The point is there is inherently risk in life, what level of limiting freedoms is acceptable.  Also you do have a choice, stay home all the time and quit your job.  Edit:  Also bad diet is instead by propaganda targeted at low income communities.
Thanks, it did turn out nicely! You can definitely see how the mullet was first created... cutting the back is hard! Lol
Any system that both takes a third of your paycheck, taxes, and still threatens you with financial ruin at any moment while making you feel like a moocher... *Maybe not a great system*.
What? Does that even mean?
Grug no want pay for poor people healthcare, why poors no just make own hospital? Grug no understand diversity of risk pools, cost reduction through preventative care, and economies of scale.
How is spending less money spending other people's money? Currently for argument's sake let's say you pay 6% of your income in taxes to fund medicare. And  2% for medicaid. You also pay for health insurance. And co-pays. You gotta pay for the medicine too. When someone with no insurance goes to the hospital and can't pay? you pay for that too with your taxes. Also due to profit incentives, prices are raised erroneously (an x ray from two different hospitals 20 miles apart can be thousands and thousands of dollars in different costs) so you pay for that too.   Or you could pay 8% taxes in medicare and be done with it. I agree with you   that we shouldn't spend other people's money on healthcare. I think we should spend less of our own money on healthcare.   It's not about "wealth redistribution" it's about redistributing your own funds into healthcare in an intelligent way instead of paying twice as much for half of the coverage. This is the most expensive healthcare system ever devised by mankind, and there are doctor's right now that cannot get a coronavirus test.  You are already paying more than you would.
The cost of US healthcare is higher than every other developed country because we are the only ones without a nationalized system. Trillions in wasted overhead plus the government cannot act as a large player and negotiate or set market prices
> The healthcare industry needs to drastically change before we can even attempt it.  That is literally what plans like Medicare for All are attempting to do.  >Most of the proposed plans are just wealth redistribution under another name.  Yes.meme

This also has a far higher mortality rate then the flu. It’s also easy to catch.
People can die from the flu, which we constantly push the usefulness of the flu shot in order to prevent that.     Life is inherently risky, but we prescribe wearing seat belts in cars, driving the speed limit, not consuming illicit drugs, having life jackets on boats, and a host of other things.     If people could succeed at limiting their freedom in the sense of wearing masks, social distancing, and actually caring about the individuals who are more at risk: the state COULD reopen. But time and again, I've seen that people are too concerned with their own freedom and do not really care about how it affects the freedom(s) of others.     And other people have a choice, too. They could take reasonable precautions to help mitigate the spread of this.
“N.C. Gen. Stat. Ann. § 130A-144 Misdemeanor (imprisonment for not more than 2 years)  All persons infected with HIV must comply with control measures for communicable diseases specified in the state administrative code. . .”
Um. Yes. It is recommend you stay home when you’re sick with any highly communicable disease.  Also, we educate and provide condoms to help slow the spread of aids and other STDS.  Do you live under some high tension power lines or something?
now that I read it again it makes sense. I just literally couldn’t understand what was being said lol. English is my second language so I guess it wasn’t clicking
Why don't rich people trying to use poor people to gain power over us pay for the hospitals for the poor? It isn't only poor people who want single-payer; it is also a large number of millionaires and billionaires who support it as well. How about all of them pool their money with everyone who wants government healthcare, and leave us innocent middle-class people out of their crap? Do you just hate people who disagree with you so you want to force us onto government healthcare until we beg for mercy?  According to [this article] (https://thehill.com/hilltv/what-americas-thinking/428958-poll-voters-want-the-government-to-provide-healthcare-for), 71% of people want some form of universal healthcare. Surely, if all of them got together, you wouldn't have any issue regarding diversity of risk pools and economies of scale, and all of them could agree to also cover preventative care.  Careful Adolf, your contempt for other people's liberty is showing.
Medicare for all is a silly plan. No other country has done this, despite the claims that “it would bring us in line with the rest of the world.” No country has “zero costs out of pocket for patients”. There’s always a catch.  NHS system in the UK has incredibly long wait times and overcrowded. In peak flu season people were waiting upwards of 12 hours to see a doctor. So much that hospitals were delaying non-urgent surgeries to the end of the months to free up doctors.  Now if you want priority care then you buy private insurance and now we’re back to square one.  The Canadian system is brought up often and it’s likely the closest thing. However, it doesn’t cover all forms of healthcare. Many Canadians still receive private insurance for other things including dental and vision, along with other procedures.  To keep costs down Canada puts strict budgets and limits to hospitals and staff training. These cause long wait times, even more than the UK. Emergency rooms waiting 1.5 hours to see a doctor and over 15 hours to being admitted to a hospital. Non-urgent surgeries are put off for weeks and months.  European countries too have private care options and providers.  Anyone who just talks on quips and memes has zero understanding of the true costs of things and how other countries work. And you want to implement an overburdened system in a country with 300+ million people? Which half of those people don’t even pay taxes? Lol okay...
Obviously, doesn’t mean a risk weighted approach is appropriate similar to the flu and aids. Didn’t say it wasn’t serious.
I literally disagree with nothing you said, this is part of the calculation.  I don’t understand why masks aren’t legally required. Also, if you’re not social distancing they should kick you out of the store.
Jesus Christ, I’m sick of explaining this shit to you mouthbreathers. THIS ISNT THE FLU. Our hospital systems are set up to deal with the flu every year. We can anticipate and deal with flu patients yearly because it is built into our structure. This isnt the flu, its new, its more contagious, there’s no vaccine. Get these simple things through your head and put on a fucking mask you absolute donkey
You are completely missing my point you dumbass. I think everyone should wear masks.   My point is we don’t personally blame our politicians when someone dies of the flu making them make tough choices for our economy and health because no matter what they lose because people expect zero death and zero economic loss.   The way we should be looking at is risk weighted to properly prioritise economic activity with an acceptable level of risk to the population. I totally think not wearing glasses a mask in a store or populated area should be illegal.  My point isn’t this is the flu, it’s that when someone dies of the flu we don’t blame our politicians.
Half of the population is vaccinated against the flu and the medical community has tools to treat the flu. They shouldn’t be blamed for people dying of an illness, they should be blamed for a colossal failure in crisis management.
I don’t know what you’re talking about though, our deaths per capita have been largely average.   Notice how the media always demands tests per capita but not deaths per capital. It’s been an average response as compared to the world. I’m not saying the federal government has done great but why aren’t people talking about our superior death per capita?  Imagine how irrational our local governments have to act to avoid blame, when we are doing better than Spain, Italy , UK by a large margin but all the US ever gets compared to us SK and Germany? I wouldn’t want to open either or if want to open to prove a point because no matter how little lives are lost I’m gonna get blamed.
The deaths per capita is only superior to the hardest hit counties. Being better than the absolute worst isn’t much of an accomplishment.    The issue with the government response if a complete lack of a comprehensive plan. There still isn’t one other than survival of the fittest.
What do you mean, we are one of the hardest hit countries. Most countries that are outside of the group don’t have governments with enough resources to report properly or report ethically.   Take our New York and we did pretty well. But that was inevitable, one of the largest most populated, density cities that is the largest travel hub for NA whose own state government was late to the game.
“...don’t have governments with enough resources to report properly or report ethically.”  Is that including the US?
I mean US has been reporting pretty well and even report probable causes which some countries don’t.   Like can you provide me one non political statistics based article saying we are doing so much worse than the rest of the world instead of throwing around bs statements and phrases with literal zero facts to back it up.  We are testing about the same per capita as Germany per day and Canada. Here is the link to capita testing.  https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/full-list-cumulative-total-tests-per-thousand?country=MEX+CAN+USA+BRA+CUB+DEU  So, what are you basing the fact that we’ve done so bad. We are now testing as much on a larger scale. We didn’t see Italy or Spain level death. So where is this utter failure your so convinced happened?
I believe last time I looked we were ranked 43rd in the world in testing. Sick job for “the richest country on earth”. This was/is an absolute colossal failure
Yes, when you count small islands like Bermuda and countries with less than 4M in population?  Germany one of the “gold standards” is also ranking high 30’s in testing.  Edit: so did Germany do a bad job? They have a better capita death rate too because they don’t even have a city with half the population density of nyc.
Hey, so do you think Germany is doing a bad job or maybe you’re just full of it?
Let me honestly ask you. Do you think Trump who denied the threat of this for months after being briefed about, lied about it, and is now desperately trying to open business again simply because he wants to get reelected at the expense of hundreds of thousands of lives...is doing a good job? Or are you just another braindead Trump lackey?
I mean answer my question?  I don’t think he lied about it, but if you showed an accurate source you could change my mind. Also, briefing are very different than a straight forewarning this is going to be a global pandemic, so depending on the nature of the briefing it’s possible.  Do I think Trump has done a great job, no. Do I think America is failing, not really either. Do I know that it’s success or failure is due to Trump, no.   I think you’re buying a lot of propaganda tbh. Honestly I see a lot of assumptions that the president has magical powers to redirect resources and has unlimited funds. I don’t think Trump is wholly competent and his inability to stop from snapping at the media when they bait him is concerning. But I think people are also blaming him from consequences that are unavoidable in a global pandemic with a country of this size. Like saying every death is on his hands is stupid, especially when everyone who has been sick has received appropriate medical care.
Lied about it? He called it a hoax and said the cases were at 15 and would soon be at 0. What else do you need dude? How is saying EXACT QUOTES from him buying propaganda.   It’s hysterical that the morons that voted for Trump because he “means what he says” almost daily have to explain that “he didnt mean what he said”. Stop doing mental gymnastics to support this absolute human disaster
I mean he was at a rally... it was kinda being over politicised at the time. What he said was not completely wrong. Him not being able to see the future really isn’t a criticism of a rational person.   You literally are spewing propaganda, you have no facts and honestly no clue what you’re talking about. You are no different than the protesters on the street. Just honestly a simple idiot who thinks he’s smarter than everyone but doesn’t listen to reason and screams about some evil fairy tale in Washington.  The truth is it’s a pandemic, am I 100% happy, no. But as someone who actually uses rational thinking, his ability to stop a pandemic seems limited compared to chancellors and prime ministers who have much more power during a crisis with a smaller more manoeuvrable population.  You can’t seem to comprehend that all the politicians have failed you and promote their own self interest per usual. It’s weird how Florida is actually one of the best states in the nation though they never did a full shut down, weird right?  If you are only grading our response by one statement a president made months ago, your a pretty big dumb ass.
...so if its at a rally its not a lie? Got it  Edit: Guess where the new hotspots are moron. Florida, pretty good idea with an elderly population
Source?  No but crazy concept, things have different meanings based on how and where you said it. It was being unfairly politicised. It’s not like Cuomo cut funding to pandemic NYC response either.
https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nytimes.com/2020/05/16/us/coronavirus-united-states.amp.html  Source on what your saying is total bullshit.
https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.local10.com/news/local/2020/05/17/palm-beach-county-opening-beaches-monday-but-is-it-an-emerging-covid-19-hotspot/%3foutputType=amp  Source in Florida says you’re a dumbass
”he alarming increase stated in the administration document conflicts with state data, according to reports. A Sun Sentinel review of state data showed a 20.7% increase in cases in Palm Beach County in the week preceding May 12. From April 28 to May 5, the data showed a 17.8% increase in cases in the county. The Palm Beach Post also questioned the data. “The only way the figures result in a 71 percent increase is if officials looked at the seven-day rise in cases on May 10, when it was 740 vs. May 3, when it was 433. But that number is so variable that the very next day, the comparison would have resulted in a 5 percent increase, from 548 to 578,” the newspaper reported.“.   Actually read the article dumb ass. Hot spot is sensationalised by the news, it has like 700 cases. But actually using critical thinking and reading comprehension aren’t skills you have. But tell me more how an orange skin man is bad.
Just lemme get this straight...your plan...in all your genius...is to open everything up as normal. Because thats what it sounds like. Fantastic bro, lets see how that works out, you should be president
can you please just once address all the misinformation you spread.   Do you think Germany did a bad job in testing? Do you think US did a bad job. Why do they have the same per capita rate and where do you draw your conclusion?  Do you think Florida is hotspot, because you saw the word hotspot. Did you actually look at any numbers or are they too complex for you?
https://imgur.com/gallery/oVAvhnx?s=sms  Going down? Yup lets’s reopen...too complicated for you?
It’s not going up lol, I don’t get your point. It’s like you just keep pushing propaganda and whenever you get frustrated back it up with gibberish.  Edit: so spoiler alert, here’s how you look at new cases and make an informed decision. You look at hospitalisations first. Because positive cases is largely dependant on testing and increasing cases more likely is a sign you should open because your increasing testing capacity if your hospitalisations are low. But that would mean you actually new how to digest number like an adult and not a sheep who blames all the world problems one man.
You should just said increasing cases is a sign we should open...I’ll leave it at that
yes because it correlates with increased testing not overall infection. Are you that dense that you can’t add perspective to stats?
Jesus Christ. I think you are retarded dude
I dare you to look at Jeff Jackson twitter or Cuomos response it took them weeks to admit hospitalizations are the most important.   I’ve been saying it the whole time, positive cases are indicative of more tests and nothing else. Tell me when you plan to get your GED and we’ll continue the discussion.
I’m a college graduate. I’m just not going to respond to someone who’s seemingly arguing with themselves.
Sure you are... it’s not like I have a masters in science and work in analytics doing this exact stuff or anything. So maybe I know what I’m talking about...
I am. And sure you are. I mean a masters degree to figure out more tests equals more positive cases? Jeez.
Didn’t you say it wasn’t indicative though? Didn’t you say more positives was bad or is increased testing bad. I’m so confused what is your point?
I am confused as to what you are saying as well, because what I’m getting from you is seem to think the virus isnt still spreading. It is
dude on what level crack are you smoking. Obviously it’s spreading... the point of hospitalizations is it’s spreading at a rate equivalent to 2 weeks ago so therefor net inflow  minus net outflow equal 0. Therefore a virus is at a sustainable rate with capacity for influx. So aka it’s time to start doing a measured approach that stops spreading enough while focus on revitalizing economic activity that should keeping hospitalizations at a reasonable rate.  Is this why you think you’re smart, because you convince yourself that having any nuanced opinion at all means that you think the virus doesn’t exist...
You are truly the the king of ad hominem. All of this leveling off of the virus was because of the measures we put in. Sure a measured approach is fine, if you’ve watched any of the videos of things reopening, including here in Charlotte, nobody seems to be following the guidelines anymore
Ive been making the same argument, I’m arguing against you because you keep using bs statistics than not addressing what value you pull from them after they are challenged which makes it very hard to debate.  Obviously, but a pretty simple solution is just making masks wearing legally required and social distancing legally required. Even if 90% of people follow it, that cuts down on most of the vectors of transmission while stimulating economic activity.

Charlotte Sees Bike Boom During Coronavirus Pandemic

If only it made people better drivers at the same time.  On another note, wear a helmet if you’re going to ride a bike!
Surprise those lime scooters haven’t been back
Since I got my ebike, I hardly use my truck anymore!
Yeah I went to walmark to purchase a bycycle and they are all out.
If you have an old used bike now is the time to sell it.  I sold a 24 and a 26 inch 18 speed bike for almost what I paid for it 5 years ago.  When I listed them on FB Marketplace I had 5 responses in minutes.
Greenways have been pretty packed. I don’t care for riding in traffic, so that’s where my wife and I go.
Yeah, you can spot these new boomers pretty easily: no helmet and usually on the sidewalk
Oh they’re back. At least I’ve gotten half a dozen emails about it lol
they are back and full effect.
I just bought a Topstone 105.  What’s you get?
I'll ride on the street most anywhere but Central which is the street I live on.  Sorry, but I've been hit by a car and it's just too dangerous.  People speed and drive like mad men on that road.    Charlotte is not very bike friendly.  I don't fault people for riding on the sidewalk if there is no bike lane.  Now, not wearing a helmet is just stupid.
Or blocking trails at WWC. Assholes killing my strava PR’s today.
People cycling on sidewalks do not bother me (and are perfectly legal, except certain spots uptown), and I get it especially for new riders who aren't comfortable on the road, but the helmet thing.... It is not hard to wear a helmet, y'all.
> and usually on the sidewalk  At least they're not bouncing back and forth between the street and cross walks and sidewalks in an unpredictable fashion like a huge swath of riders did before we all went into lock down.
Gotcha, haven’t seen them yet
You're more likely to get hit on the sidewalk, but do whatever you wanna do bro
They're both equally wrong
This is true. The sidewalk isn’t very visible to drivers and works for slow moving traffic, like pedestrians. A cyclist going at least 12mph is at risk, especially when cars are turning. Same goes for biking against traffic, that’s just dumb.

Charlotte bike sales ‘utterly crazy’ as weary riders seek coronavirus relief outdoors

As an avid cyclist this is good because next year the used bike market will be flooded with with cheaper second hand bikes.  What irks me is I keep seeing all these new people on the local trails without helmets.
Working in essential retail, it’s been interesting to see the changes in items being sold out. First it was cleaning, first aid and soup/pasta/bread. Then meat and excersise gear, then home office and video games, and Now it’s All sporting good / yard games, bikes and pools are gone.
Even more reason to justify adding more bike lanes, this city desperately needs it. People would use them if they were more readily available. Glad to see the local bike shops are thriving though! Helped my gf grab a bike from the Recyclery just in time, everywhere is swamped. It’s tough to find a bike and get it serviced. Now if this rain would go away, I could ride more...
Gotta get me a used Schwinn in a few months! :P
I work at REI and we have been selling a crap-ton (both shipping to people and curbside pickup) of bikes these past two months and our bike service shop has been completely overrun. It's insane to see but it makes me glad that people are enjoying the outdoors more.
Keep riding those bikes when this is over. Take back the roads!
Just go to the greenway, it's obvious
Literally zero helmets. Truly don’t get it - they’re scared of Covid but not permanent brain damage?
Also not caring about directions.
It's crazy to see how hard the culture of helmets has shifted since the 90s.  In the 90s as a kid it was like, fuck a helmet that is stupid looking.  I seldom saw anyone wearing one except avid bikers who do it all the time sometimes.  Hardly ever on children.  I haven't really ridden a bike since the 90s though.  When I thought of it recently I was actually kind of paranoid at the thought of even riding a bike now lol I'm like shit, I could fall off and break my neck.  Didn't think twice as a kid
Now that you mention it, I'll have to keep an eye out for something with that Rohloff hub I have been drooling over for the past decade or so. Used is about the only way I'm going to afford one.  Not that I think there is more than a 1/100,000 chance of seeing one...
Our old printer finally stopped working and we found out it was a hot item. Apparently, everyone home from school and work needed a printer. I had to order online.
Trampolines.. Gone
This city needs bike lanes so bad....the new Plaza road diet is great, hoping they do something similar with Parkwood and Matheson
I've been biking on the street for about 30 years, with 25 or so of those in New York City. I don't think bike lanes are the answer for a wide range of reasons. Cyclists need training and education on how to stay safe.
I bought a bike stand on sale at REI (sale runs their 25th). And I’m teaching myself how to maintain mine and my wife’s bikes.
Schwinn isn't the brand it used to be
>Bicycle revolution!
Around the neighborhood I don't mind seeing no helmets but it's definitely a risk.  When I get mad is when I see a dad still in his jeans heading to the local MTB trails with the kids and no one in helmets.  That sort of behavior is just going to kill it for everyone when he gets hurt and his insurance decides to sue the park for compensation and the trails get shutdown.  All because dad didn't think helmets were cool.
Ahh yes. I completely forgot home office, video games and tv’s.
Bikes, weights, pools, yard games... just about anything to do with outdoor / sporting goods is gone
Just imagine if they connected the Plaza to Matheson and Parkwood to where like Optimist Hall is, it’d be great. So many people would ride that route and do so safely... there are ways to do it and hopefully we can start to see a shift soon towards that. Having to ride sidewalks and map out your routes down to a damn science to avoid major streets gets annoying. Having ways to connect across the city with bike lanes and greenways helps so much. Seems like more people are starting to realize that, now hopefully we can expand it.
https://charlottenc.gov/Projects/Pages/ParkwoodPlazaStudy.aspx
Yeah, bike lanes aren't really the answer, but at least they're a half step towards getting there
That would be wonderful!
Nice! Have they started this project yet? I tried looking but the project details just say 1-3 years for completion.
I think they are a step in the wrong direction. We can make the city safer and better for cyclists without them.
Latest status update says land is acquired and they will be getting into the bidding phase next. I think they expect construction to start mid 2021.
Sure, but they do speed up cycling adoption in the city which accelerates all efforts in the long run. I'm not disagreeing, you just can't brute force a healthy cycling culture
Sweggy. Thanks!
I think they would come at too big of a cost for the rest of the city. There are better ways to grow Charlotte's cycling community

North Carolina Reports Highest One Day Spike Of COVID-19 Cases : Coronavirus Live Updates : NPR

It’s ok, we’re just following the Swedish model!   Well, except for the universal healthcare, lower obesity, diabetes, and preexisting condition rates.  But hey, Herd Immunity! Except herd immunity is for when there is a vaccine and it’s to protect those who can’t get vaccinated, but that’s ok!
But here’s to phase II
Turns out letting bars and restaurants get packed for memorial day weekend might not be the brightest move during a pandemic.
I’m genuinely confused when people start throwing the term herd immunity around right now like it’s actually a thing. Like ???? Do y’all just like the way it sounds? Because we are NOT going to get herd immunity until there’s a vaccine? Like, that’s what herd immunity needs... to exist?
While I agree with the sentiment, Memorial Day weekend had nothing to do with this spike.   " Cases increased by 1,107 Saturday and tests by 26,385" -  [https://www.newsobserver.com/news/coronavirus/article242954286.html](https://www.newsobserver.com/news/coronavirus/article242954286.html)   26k tests is about 4x as many tests as normal.
with *this* spike.    i'd put money on it being related to our next spike.
Well yes, that's logical that more people congregating likely means more people will get infected.

I would like to thank those people out and about in bars/restaurants ensuring a second wave of coronavirus to come again inevitably. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR NOT SOCIAL DISTANCING! Cant wait to do this shit all over again 🙃🙃🙃🙃


7 Day (Rolling Average) Shows New NC Coronavirus Cases in Decline (not just leveling)

If you wanted to make the argument that the pandemic is lessening, the death data provides a more compelling argument. The problem is of course that deaths are a lagging indicator of case burden. A concern with the graph you showed is that the most recent data points are exceptionally noisy. You have the huge spike (perhaps the Tyson plant in N Wilkesboro?) and a huge decline coinciding with the Memorial Day holiday. Today will be an interesting day for reporting as, ostensibly, all responsible parties for reporting should be caught up. I would be thrilled if today's new cases were below the 7 day MA.
My suspicion would be this simply represents a logistical weekend lag in reporting and we’ll see a corresponding spike early in the week. Plus... testing?
[Looks to me like we’re in sort of a confusing up and down period.](https://i.imgur.com/UPsjAOG.jpg)
For anyone wondering, this graph comes straight from the NC Covid dashboard, located here.  Updated daily, I think around lunchtime.   [https://covid19.ncdhhs.gov/dashboard](https://covid19.ncdhhs.gov/dashboard)   Lots of other interesting graphs as well.  Testing over the past several days has been very low, so it's quite possible the low case levels is due to low testing.
My understanding is that the most recent several days of data is likely incomplete and we should probably wait a few more days before we include this weeks early numbers in any sort of trend analysis. Particularly given that it was a holiday weekend. I would be shocked if that didn’t have any impact on testing and reporting.
It must be a complete and total coincidence that absolutely no one has commented on this post yet.
The dashboard has been updated and the numbers are not as encouraging as this graph.   The lull correlates to less completed tests. The spike in the new graph correlates to increased tests.  Small bump in the number of total people hospitalized.     Much obliged for the link to the NC DHHS site!
Data source?
I and everyone I know have yet to be tested.
Since you mention it, deaths by the way is showing an extreme negative trend as well.  The latest daily count was 3, which is the lowest since the pandemic started.  That said, I'm not certain that either is a sign of pandemic lessening, as it could as easily be we are getting better at treating and preventing mortality.  It's still encouraging.  Reported elsewhere in the thread, but today's cases are basically right at almost exactly the latest 7 day moving average.  That latest 7 day MA is \~475, well below the peak 7 day MA of \~700 cases.
It was somewhat deliberately presented without commentary, other than headline, which is 100% factual. I agree totally that we are in an exceptionally noisy period and the downward trend may or may not be meaningful. The extreme 5/23 outlier really messes with the trending.
That’s entirely possible. I presented this somewhat without commentary to see how this might be interpreted. Testing over the last few days has been the lowest in quite a while, which is troubling, so it's entirely possible this is an artifact of low testing. This is a great example where people need to look at all the datapoints to draw a more general conclusion, not just one.  But I’ve seen quite a few other threads earlier just after the 5/22 spike where everyone was like, yeah, this is exactly what we all knew would happen with reopening. Now that we are further from that spike and the opposite trend is showing, it might be that was a false jump to conclusions. I can’t predict anymore than the next person.
For those interested in what today's updates might bring:  * Completed tests reported today highest in quite a while -- 11,825 (highest ever was 14k on 5/20) * New cases as expected jumped back up to 488, still below long term daily trend of \~600. * % of positive tests to total tests stayed roughly flat at 8% * Strong 7 day rolling average downward trend still showing in the data. * Covid deaths is also showing a very strong negative trend.  Yesterday's death count of 3 was lowest since the pandemic hit NC. * The current 7 day MA daily cases is \~475.  The peak 7 day MA was on 5/23 at \~700 daily new cases.
Well one chart is looking at NC data overall while the other is looking at Mecklenburg. The population densities of the two are different, and a higher population density would make for more of an “overshoot” as the epidemic peaks and starts dropping.  NYC is the best example of this: the infection numbers flew up and had so much momentum they overshot the equilibrium the rest of the state eventually reached.
That's one way of putting it.
It's been quite clear for awhile that no one wants to hear encouraging news on this subject. It's... troubling.
It's insane.    Per  [https://covid19.ncdhhs.gov/](https://covid19.ncdhhs.gov/)   800\~ deaths  504 over the age of 75  168 aged 65-74  96 aged 50-64  32 aged 25-49 (fairly large criteria but whatever)  Zero deaths under the age of 25, in the entire 10 million person population of the state.    Oh, and 702 people hospitalized.  In the whole state.    CDC now says it isn't spread by surface contact and the masks do absolutely nothing.   People want this to be more than it is, it's become something of a cause.  It's weird.
NC Covid dashboard, most reliable source.  Link added to the thread.
Totally reasonable. And I'm definitely pleased to see today's report wasn't above the MA. To your previous comment I thought it was a weird editorial comment on your part until I realized it was directly from DHHS. Ha, sorry about that.
I'd argue the extreme outlier is yesterday's number. Number of tests fell by almost 60% on 5/26 -- the lowest number in over two weeks -- so it's no surprise that number of positive cases fell by c75%.  You're correct that the headline is factually correct but it's also misleading.
The fact that you are getting downvoted for presenting facts is the way this sub works.  Those people are either enjoying their sweet bump in income due to them having shitty jobs, many live at home, and others wanting to shame others for not following along.  It also shows how easily fascism will be implemented when it is time.
We all want to hear good news. It's just that we're too cautious to immediately trust someone when they tell us things are getting better.  The White House has been telling us things are ok for months. "Don't worry, go back to work, etc." It's a trust issue, not a matter of pessimism.
Your downvotes prove your statement. Reddit really just needs to die.
>CDC now says it isn't spread by surface contact and the masks do absolutely nothing.   Where the hell did you read that? That sounds like some dangerous misinformation to be spreading around.
From a purely statistical standard deviation perspective, the 5/23 data point (sorry, earlier mentioned it was 5/22, actually was 5/23), is definitely a larger outlier to the trend than the 5/26 data point (though it's not terribly much further out).  In terms of misleading, not sure I agree.  Depends on your perspective I suppose.  It's only misleading if you know exactly what the future cases will be, otherwise incomplete would likely be the more accurate criticism.  There was no major agenda to this post other than perhaps a counterpoint to some threads from earlier in the week where the trend was more impacted by the 5/23 data, and everything was pointing up. You could make a similar argument there.  If anything, this thread is my encouragement to look at primary sources and not rely on headlines or others interpretation of the data.
Thank you for actually responding; I do think what's pretty telling is that most positive posts and comments just get downvoted without any discourse. So again, thanks for actually sharing your thoughts.  The flip side to your coin is I don't know how anyone can trust the negative data, either. Hospitals are claiming Covid deaths when a person dies while merely showing symptoms without being tested. They are claiming Covid deaths when Covid was secondary to a more serious COD...again only with symptoms and not actual testing.. And they are being incentivized to do these things.  And journalists long ago turned into ad salesmen in an over-saturated market where clicks and views determine revenue, so I don't know anyone can trust them, either.  Personally, I've barely left the house since mid-March aside from going running and grocery shopping, and I wear a mask at the store because why not? I just think we need to get the entire conversation around this thing to a place of logic, while understanding a lot of people are indeed scared.  EDIT: clarity
Or imagine living in NY or SF and having your politicians tell you it’s Ok to go to all the festivities.
I agree with your first sentence.:)  I think Reddit's great. You just have to remember that the political commentary skews young and dumb. And the karma whoring leads to a herd mentality.
I like how they claimed the CDC said something and then cited something other than the CDC.  [The CDC says to use a fucking mask](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html)
https://www.researchgate.net/publication/340570735_Masks_Don't_Work_A_review_of_science_relevant_to_COVID-19_social_policy
I guess I would just argue that posting a headline and data point - the relevance of which has been questioned many times, and where there are significant reasons to question the obvious - that points people to a particular interpretation, and then saying "I wanted to teach people to look at primary sources" is kind of a cop-out. But you did circle back in later posts with the caveat, and ultimately I agree with what you say your message is.
I agree with everything you said here. I try to take the common sense approach. I have a hard time believing any positive or negative news because it seems like you can manipulate data or graphs any which way you want. It seems like people are openly rooting for negative news or the worst case scenario. Like you said the downvoting to anything positive is pretty insane
>Hospitals are claiming Covid deaths when a person dies while merely showing symptoms without being tested. They are claiming Covid deaths when Covid was not the primary cause due to a pre-existing condition...  Two things:  1. It shouldn't matter if there were pre-existing conditions. We're seeing a level of death by disease that we haven't seen in this country in generations. If you don't know anyone who's been impacted by covid, count yourself lucky, because some of us can't say the same.  2. Those people with pre-existing conditions (along with other vulnerable demographics like children and the elderly) are part of the reason why the general populace should practice so much caution. The threat of covid lies not just in it's potential lethality but also in it's highly contagious nature. Nobody wants to get sick, but we should also be vigilant against carrying and spreading disease.   When in doubt, we should err on the side of caution. If 100,000 dead Americans is an exagerrated figure (which I doubt it is), the truth can't be much easier to stomach.
Now you need to worry about the Chinese propaganda since Reddit is now partially owned by TenCent media.  Once you see it you’ll never forget it.
I blocked him and others should consider doing the same. He's spreading lies while simultaneously attempting to excuse needless death.
Thanks for your thoughts. I think some people are really scared, but how could they not be given the disgusting way the media is covering this?  And unfortunately there are quite a few people who want the lockdown to continue because they are making more money on unemployment than they were at their job.
I meant to say, "a primary cause of death with Covid being secondary." I will fix it. And, they aren't doing this.
Nothing in your post is based in anything resembling fact.  We have had SARS, H1N1, H3N2 (which is really worth looking up, no social distancing at Woodstock)  The idea that Covid is somehow bigger or worse is nonsense.  And it absolutely matters if there are pre-existing conditions, especially if over 70% of deaths are people that had one.  Why wouldn't we quarantine them right away?  And if children are vulnerable, why isn't there a single instance of a child dying in the entire state of North Carolina?    State after state is lowering it's death numbers.  Colorado's was actually 23% lower.  Lot of people were hung up on Jeff Jackson's initial projections of 4,400 deaths in NC, and we haven't hit 800 yet.  Why would anyone think we have accurate numbers at this point?    People like a good panic.  And you should stop posting nonsense, it just adds to the problem.
It's a troll account - it's less than 3 months old and has already maxxed out the negative comment karma meter.
Yes I get that people are scared. It’s just wild people can’t see that almost any news outlet is going to twist information to their narrative. It seems like common sense would let you see that. Really every news outlet has really let down the American people on this one. I hate that I don’t have a news source I can look to that seems like a straightforward honest source. Where do you go for your news?
Maybe a plant, paid to spread misinformation? I don't want to sound paranoid, but it happens
Various sources. Honestly a lot of it is just trying to discern who's wanting to report and who isn't. Even the worst networks still have individual reporters who just want to cover news.  I largely have lists created on Twitter which include various thought leaders and journalists whom I've learned to see things a little more logically and not get swept up in a herd mindset. I break the lists down into topics for easier reading. I've also curated my Google app to weed out sources I've deemed bad and pull more from sources I've never seen before, so I'm getting alot of information I wouldn't find elsewhere through that as well.

Trump demands Republican convention ‘with no masks or social distancing’ despite coronavirus pandemic

Let the RNC walk, then. Charlotte doesn't need thousands and thousands of people - from all over the country - coming to our city while refusing to practice basic public health safety guidelines.
Governor Cooper and Mandy Cohen are just gonna say no, so I see no reason to put up a fight.
There should be no handwashing either. Not in bathrooms or food handling or anything.
Here ya go, have a CNN article, quoting a spokesman for the governor of North Carolina. Got America written all over it.  https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/29/politics/north-carolina-governor-trump-convention-no-face-masks/index.html
Trump should just shut up now. He adds nothing to any discussion about anything.  He has no"value add." He's worthless as a leader, as a problem solver, as a thinker, speaker, policy maker.... Nothing. He brings nothing. He just stirs the pot.
Trump has Cooper by the balls on this and they both know it.  Cooper can posture all he wants, but the media is quickly shifting their focus from the 'virus' to 'racism', and that does not bode well for Cooper's baseless justification to cancel the RNC.    It's going to happen, and honestly who cares?  Is anyone under the illusion that Donald Trump won't receive the nomination regardless of what city the convention is held in?  Are Charlotte's hospitality and service workers doing so well that the convention wouldn't massively benefit them?    What exactly are people downvoting here, peoples' ability to make a living?
Look at the fucking protest tonight and tell me those hundreds of people are practicing social distancing. There are tens of thousands on both sides of this nationwide, and I don't see the virus being used as an excuse to end it.  Don't try to use the pandemic when it's politically convenient. You'd think protestors cured the virus with how no one cares about it anymore.
Posted by an international source so it must be accurate
Americans are so weak. A couple of weeks of inconvenience and you're ready to risk the lives of yourself and everyone you come in contact with.
"Enough already!!"  Enough what, safety? Caution? Intelligence? smh
This comment isnt going to go over well.
People are not against the convention because they think having it elsewhere will effect the election, they are agaisnt it because its the perfect opportunity for covid 19 to spread and that could cost charlotte more than the convention would bring in.
This just in!  /u/mutatismutandis2 confirms Trump finally has a set of balls.  A first for the geriatric orange imbicile.  Better late than never I guess.
>What exactly are people downvoting here     Dumb comments made by dumber people.
RemindMe! 2 months  EDIT 8/1/2020: HAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHHAHAAHA
Its completely possible to be against both of those things, I'm for both if they both are practiced with regards to the virus and against both if they are not.
I'm not seeing how the two are related. Where did the OP say they were ok with the protests? Why should we follow up on the protests with even more opportunities for infection?
This post wasn't even about the protests tho.
Because international outlets are not allowed to report on what's happening in the United States -- got it.
No, it won't.    It also won't be refuted.
The only reason the tin can tan man wants to do it here is because Obama did it here to get nominated for his second term, and everyone knows the tin can tan man has ODS.

iTs ThE kIdS tHaT aRe WrOnG!
It’s about selectively using the virus to prevent gatherings of people — clearly in a political slant. Whether that’s a protest, which protest, or the RNC it’s the same concept.  You can’t sit here and say “it’s fine when thousands of people get together and protest in May/June” but then “dangerous and irresponsible” in August, come on.
I’m not saying you are wrong, but if you’re reporting something between the POTUS and the Gov of our State come with a better source than a  European journal
ok boomer.  just pray you don't have to wait in line for a ventilator.
>	Why aren’t people lining up to knock down my straw men?
So the virus is the 'baseless justification'? Wow that's pretty a pretty stupid comment. I'll bet you think the earth is flat too. And 6,000 years old perhaps?
Get a look at this pro life guy geez
>	The worst part about this post isn't that it doesn't make any sense, it's that you were obviously really excited about posting something this dumb.  He said, unironically.
lOcAL nEWz Iz oNly NeWZ!!!
But how does this being a European source necessarily take away from the validity of the reporting? The Independent has a solid reputation for factual reporting. And in the year 2020, it's quite apparent that information can be spread instantly, geographical proximity no barrier.
Because local news is so [trust](https://youtu.be/QxtkvG1JnPk) worthy?
Thanks for clarifying that I wasn't being ironic.  I'm sure it was tough to think of something more clever than calling President Trump 'orange man', but is that really all you had?  And you guys still don't see why you keep losing elections.  I mean, it's fun for me to watch you idiots constantly shoot yourselves in the foot, but it is getting kind of sad too.  Five more months.  I can't wait.
> And you guys still don't see why you keep losing elections.  Says after RNC wins one general election but then lost some out on the midterms that followed.

Trump plans to use Gov Roy Cooper as a scapegoat in endangering NC residents during campaign rally by ignoring Corona Virus safety measures

Ah nice more fear mongering. Turn off CNN for two seconds and look at the actual  numbers: 441,248 test results reported today, the most ever. Percent positive: 4.3%, the lowest ever. Number of deaths: 523, the lowest daily number since March 29th. covidtracking.com/data/us-daily
Wow...editorialize titles much?
This would say otherwise: https://www.reddit.com/r/Charlotte/comments/gqqufx/covid19_new_cases_total_cases_wkly_avg_and/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share
You should be scared lol. The measures we're taking now are effective. By being reckless we will be susceptible again. The POTUS plans to blame the governor for his own failed campaign initiatives and wants to create turmoil. If he gets his way, it will be regular people dying on his behalf. What don't you get?
Some people just want to be scared of their TV tells them to.  With a mortality rate of .4% for people that are symptomatic, it’s time to end this farce.  We have been lied to, all in the name of political games.
It's a tldr in a title. Did you even read the article or are you another reddit hivemind member that thinks they're above having to dedicated the time to understanding? You just downvote and move on huh?
Yes.... we are saying the same thing. Numbers go up as testing goes up.  Deaths still going down. I c can’t figure out why you guys are so upset we are beating this thing?????
Right because that’s Exactly  what happened in Georgia and Florida remember????? They’re welllll into opening open and are right on average with the dem states that are locked down.  Nothing left to talk about here.  Research it. Again, no idea why it personally offends you we are beating this.  Have a great day!
You couldn’t be more wrong if you tried. Grow up.
> Did you even read the article  Yes I did. that's actually how I knew you editorialized the title.   >are you another reddit hivemind member that thinks they're above having to dedicated the time to understanding?  Ha...that's rich.   >You just downvote and move on huh?  I didn't downvote anything on this thread, however I probably should for the blatant editorializing of the headline...and then move on.
I’m baffled by this as well.
I’m not even sure why we’re even looking at positive cases because most people who have it are asymptomatic or deal with it and move on with their lives.  We’re also testing more, and of course that would increase the positive cases, as you stated. What I would think would be the key factor here are the “actual” covid19 deaths. With that being said, the death numbers have been proven to be exaggerated by the hospitals because they get money ($13k) for labeling it as a “covid19” death.  This statistic will never be accurate for that reason. I suspect most people will test positive for covid19 if they were tested because it was around before all the media coverage and we were all going about our business. It’s amazing how the MSM can alter the way people think.  The truth is that if there wasn’t any or very little covid19 media coverage people wouldn’t really think too much about it. It wouldn’t shut down the economy like it has. Nobody really cared too much about the regular flu season, when tens of thousands of people were dying, because the numbers weren’t plastered on the tv screen every 5 seconds.  I’ll go back in my cave now.....
Because the cure has been way worse than the disease itself.
No one is upset we're beating it.  We're scared of being reckless and losing all the progress we've made.  Your jump to conclusion there is sending me red flags.
You don't have an argument if you can't express it.
You want me to copy paste the article title then?  That would make you happy?  It's a TL;DR, that's what you do when you submit an article.  It's not even an opinion, it's what the article says.
who's proven the death numbers are exaggerated?
I'll send some 5g signals your way.
I’m sorry these facts give you red flags.  I can ONLY base my numbers off of the states that have re-opened and theirs numbers are down and continuing to fall.  This is a very good thing. I’m sorry man, people just don’t buy it anymore. You can keep trying but we have the facts. It’s hard to scare people when the facts don’t say it man.  Good luck sheltering in place.
While this sub does not ban editorializing titles, many do. I consider it a courtesy NOT to, and I try to avoid it for that reason. Do unto others and all that.  >It's a TL;DR, that's what you do when you submit an article.  It's not what I do...I submit the article with the title as proposed. I hope people read the articles I post and I don't want to insert my own editorialized titles for them as I feel this can be misleading and dishonest.   Post whatever you want however you want.   >It's not even an opinion, it's what the article says.  There is a ton of opinion, both in the article and in your title, but you can't see that since you are convinced your are right and that your opinion isn't opinion so much as a fact. If you don't recognize that then I would question your critical thinking skills.
Your only purpose is to berate me.  You're on a second agenda at this point.  I don't have to make this point either, you can go test your theory personally.  You won't though, you're just a keyboard warrior.  e: this is you: [https://i.redd.it/y5ql29uby3151.jpg](https://i.redd.it/y5ql29uby3151.jpg)
My words are taken from the article, that's why it's a tl;dr.  You question my thinking skills, I question your ability to read a point I've made multiple times.  Let's consider it this time.
