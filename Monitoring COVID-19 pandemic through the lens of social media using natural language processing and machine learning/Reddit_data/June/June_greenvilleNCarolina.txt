COVID-19 Testing in Pitt Co
Forgive me if this is already posted somewhere here but I did not see it. Figured I would post to help others who might need it. Hoping people can add to it should they have more information. This is all I know of thus far:* Drive-thru at Walmart location no longer happening* FastMed Urgent Care on Greenville Blvd doing testing. Check in online to reserve your spot. Appointment slots filling up fast. Takes 5+ days for results* Physician's East taking appointments, assuming you are a patient there. Call the COVID hotline (on their website). The live operator will take notes and send to your MD who will follow back up with you to determine if you qualify for a test. If you do, you are given an appointment. Wait outside until they call you in, then quick nose swab. Results in 36-48 hours. * Testing at a lab center (forgot the name). Two live virus tests and two anti-body tests available. Different routes of testing. Costs minimum of $95; antibody up to $135.
There is also testing available at Vidant Employee Clinic. Itâ€™s a drive up by appointment.  252-847-2273.  Results are 2-5 days and they file insurance.
Also, Vidant has setup a COVID hotline if you feel that you have symptoms etc.  252-847-8000
Thank you! We need more information like this. Can you tell me where you located it?
Google and phone calls to the locations :)
