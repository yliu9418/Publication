U.S. Government backs AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine candidate, could be ready by October 2020
A collaboration between the Department of Health and Human Services and AstraZeneca is projected to make available 300 million doses of a COVID-19 vaccine, the first of which could be available as early as October, HHS [said](http://send.aha.org/link.cfm?r=oNoHhwgs6F2sBeK3Mmtygg~~&pe=H9GqNj2NTx9EYOy4eZfdkraLrCrbQR4F6c7GV_Dn_JmMMGtfD403vXbah5Sl74uI5aNf5aqiYhpdSYlma0DIwA~~&t=wZUSASo9vNeKDabvSwwhIw~~) May 21. The agreement is part of the White House's Operation Warp Speed, a public-private effort to facilitate, at an unprecedented pace, the development, manufacturing and distribution of COVID-19 countermeasures. HHS says phase three clinical studies of AZD1222 are set to start in the summer.
Very much doubt that this will happen, but if it does I hope they share their vaccine widely.

I highly recommend a CVS drive through minute clinic.  I found it easy to make an appointment (same day) as well as carry out the test.  I had to do it myself so if that's something that makes you uneasy, you can bring someone to help you do it.  Should be getting my results in 24-48 hours.
How long did your results end up taking?
I'm so sorry I've just seen this.  2 days and they came back positive.  Not 100% sure but I heard that the longer they take to come back, the more likely they are to be negative, but i have nothing to back that up.
No worries, hope you’re okay

Heartbreaking.
Do they know if she had any underlying conditions? Regardless, this is tremendously saddening and my heart goes out to the family.
That sweet angel 💔
No, she was a perfect health girl. We got COVID-19 from our parents but we don’t know where she got streptococcus (strep throat). Both of these combined was going to be hard for her. The bacteria caused her to have the seizures, brain swelling and irreversible brain damage eventually leaving her brain dead. Hope that clears up something

NHRMC has upgraded to level 2 (20-50 Covid patients).   :(
Source:  Johns Hopkins University, Coronavirus research center  https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/new-cases-50-states
[John Hopkins historic data for NC](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/new-cases-50-states/north-carolina).  Floyd died on May 26. Two weeks from then would be Jun 9th. Surprise, surprise look at that uptick.  So who are the bioterrorists with all the blood of dead grandmothers on their hands now? You can thank yourselves for the second wave.  Hope it was worth it when even more businesses have to close, perhaps permanently. But hey, at least you got some new street art on in your city now, so that's cool I guess.
What does that mean?
Where did you see this?
I normally don't feed trolls, but this could be informative for others.   You're not wrong that there was likely a good amount of spread at the protests, but the uptick we're seeing now is too soon. The real impact of the protests will be seen in another two to four weeks.  First, large protests didn't begin in NC immediately after Floyd's murder.  Second, significant increase in cases as a result of the protests will not simply be those that got infected at the protests. It will be 2nd, 3rd, and 4th 'generation' infections. Most protestors were younger, they may never know they were sick. But they will unknowingly infect their parents, coworkers, cashiers, etc. Who will go on to do the same. This is why the impact from the protests will not simply be one incubation period from the event, but a little more strung out.   Third, phase 2 started the Friday before memorial day. So the increase we're seeing right now is from phase 1 and phase 2 starting too soon. There are *far* more people going into stores and restaurants without masks on around the state than there were people protesting. This is the behavior that is causing the spread we are now seeing in the data.   Fourth, your choice of words and desperation to place blame on protestors indicates to me that you are likely a bit of a prick.  Come back with your soap box in a couple weeks when it makes more sense.
Level 1 is 0-19 COVID patients.  Level 2 is 20-50 COVID patients.   Not sure what they rate past that. I can find out (or someone who knows can add!)
Directly from an NHRMC nurse who got off shift yesterday. 😕  NHRMC doesn’t publish this info (anywhere that I’m aware of or am privy to.)
My gripe is that the COVID shaming seems entirely selective based on political agenda.  Want to protest to reopen the state? You’re a bioterrorist freak who just wants a haircut and will kill everyone’s grandmother by spreading the virus.  Want to protest for weeks on end, in large numbers, because a cop was excessive in a city hundreds of miles away? Zero issue, carry on! In fact, you know what... let’s go worldwide in millions!  This isn’t about what political things you and I value over another. This is the principle of we’re in a pandemic or not. The virus does not give a shit about why we’re outside together.  Either it’s too dangerous to protest or it’s not, not just for some people.
Ugh.  They really need to.  Might help some of those more resist to following the rules to understand why it's so important.
>My gripe is that the COVID shaming seems entirely selective based on political agenda.  So, exactly what your parent comment is doing? Fuck off

Just got tested for COVID-19 awaiting the results
So it's not the test I was expecting, nothing went in my nose they put saline in my nostrils and had me blow. I was also tested for strep throat that the flu but those results came back negative so they think it might be COVID so they advised me to stay home until I get the results in about 4 days. I feel like trash here's hoping it's won't be that bad.

Good luck!  Thanks for letting others know about the testing method. That’s really interesting.
If you don’t mind me asking, what region are you in? I’ve heard the test vary depending on city, but wasn’t sure.
So question for you and everyone, is it true that it’s extremely expensive? And insurance is not paying for it unless you have symptoms? Does anyone know?
I'm in Onslow County
I didn't have to pay anything when I got tested, so I'm assuming my insurance covered it

Why the hell are people traveling?
Perhaps you’d like to visit r/coronaflorida
A woman lost her job for reporting there were purposeful inaccuracies in that data.
It’s very worrisome when people go to these hot spots and possibly bring it back home.
TLDR.
Uhm ya would be great for N.C. but uhm its floriduh
These are Floridians (infected with COVID-19) who travelled to North Carolina. (And perhaps vice versa)  Relatively Old men brought COVID here throughout March 2020.
No doubt.  “We need to slow down the testing”
It’s Floridians who visited N.C. who tested positive for coronavirus
These are Floridians (infected with COVID-19) who travelled to North Carolina. (And perhaps vice versa)  Relatively Old men brought COVID here throughout March 2020.
Along with all the people who came for the basketball tournament.
Cool story, bro.
I stand corrected
Thank you
Thank you

Ignore those calls lmao
Major!!! I miss Durham.
Just remember y’all, stay skeptical.  A surge of cases doesn’t necessarily mean more danger or that we need to be afraid of reopening.  https://www.orlandomedicalnews.com/article/3545/letter-to-the-editor-why-increasing-number-of-cases-of-covid-19-is-not-bad-news
Yeah let’s sabotage the local economy until November so we can blame it all on Trump!  Who cares who goes out of business, loses their job, has to foreclose on their house, it’s all about getting the orange man out!
You’re an idiot
Where did I say anything about trump moron. I’d just rather not have millions of people die
But rather have millions be out of work again with a completely dysfunctional unemployment system. Great. Cause that won’t contribute to suicide or anything.
We can either lock down, the economy is hurt in the short term, and the virus goes away faster so we can reopen and heal the economy (basically what is already happening in Europe)  Or we can semi-close and re-open repeatedly, causing continual spikes every couple months, harming the economy in the long term, and killing millions of people in the process. We don’t get our lives back until mid 2021 at the earliest when people get the vaccine.
10,000 dead will harm the economy far less than millions upon millions unemployed. That’s the greater good reality.  Everything has a cost and impact to the whole. Speaking of Europe, didn’t Sweden have success with a no-lockdown approach? Their chief health minister is also an epidemiologist.  What’s worse? .0003% of the 310 million population dying from a disease, or 15% of the entire country being unemployed for months on end?  Death is never great, but we are a country that rely on each other. When that grinds to a halt, everyone suffers.
You think there will only be 10,000 dead? Lol.
Every model predicted has been shown to be wrong. I go with what we have so far in reality, not doom and gloom models that prove false.  Even hitting 240k deaths isn’t freak out worthy. Yeah it sucks; but this is where we are at. We have a virus that should have never been a situation but thanks China.   Thanks for bringing this into the world, lockdown down your country but allowing international flights so you can export it.  For a country of our size and population, we’re doing a pretty decent job with deaths per capita.
I encourage you to look at graphs of infections rates in other countries compared to ours and get back to me. Maybe start with New Zealand?

North Carolina Surpassed Virginia (Next Up, Maryland). Mecklenburg County is 10K+ COVID-19 cases.
North Carolina (62K) surpassed Virginia. Next Up, Maryland (66.7K).North Carolina is ranked #13 in # Cases COVID-19 infections. States ahead: NY, CA, NJ, TX, Ill, FL, Mass, Penn, GA, Arizona, Michigan, and MD.Mecklenburg County is over 10,000 COVID-19 infected cases.

Federal Bureau of Prison COVID-19 Data (Note: Institution Name Data)
I don't know the names of the North Carolina specific prisons. Here's the link: [https://www.bop.gov/coronavirus/](https://www.bop.gov/coronavirus/) You have to know the names, match to the county (and them wonder if they are/ are not included in the count). Then - we need to make sure it's addressed immediately in our state (and then, through the system).

Dc_gay_man, thanks for all the info you are a big help buddy
There's an interactive map that shows which prisons are included in the dataset, and you can sort the table by state.  There's only one in NC: FCC Butner, located in Butner. At time of writing, stats across all reporting Butner wings are:  * 592 inmates positive * 12 staff positive * 23 inmates dead * 1 staff dead * 306 inmates recovered * 48 staff recovered
Thanks. Let me know if you find something when you read the info.
Interesting datapoints:  * 1 staff death of 48 recoveries is 2% mortality rate. * 23 inmate deaths of 306 recoveries is 7.5% mortality rate.  Considering the conditions/age and care of prisoners, I'd say this is optimistic. The virus is not nearly as lethal as initially thought.

Well according to potus it's going away! He's the smartest man in the world, it's over we can just go back to normal get out of here with your fake news!  /s
um... I really, really hope Biden wins so I can listen to all my whiny ass Trump friends bitch about it when he gives rambling incoherent encouragement to the country.  Yes, it sucks for those of us who despise Trump but have to put up with partisan shitposts like yours.
Wow, tough day at the office ehh?
