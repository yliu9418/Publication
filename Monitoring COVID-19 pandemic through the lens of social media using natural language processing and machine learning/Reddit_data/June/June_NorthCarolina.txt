NC has consistently been in the top 10 when it comes to new COVID-19 cases.

In other news, NC is in the top 10 states by total population.      Not saying we don’t have a problem, but a simplest of totals does not show what’s really going on.
What place is NC in cases and deaths per 1M on that graph?
North Carolina has also been steadily ramping up testing, so naturally they are going to find more cases. [https://covid19.ncdhhs.gov/dashboard/testing](https://covid19.ncdhhs.gov/dashboard/testing)     Can you link to the source of your photo? I'd love to see how NC ranks in terms of percent positive tests, number of tests, and number of deaths. Deaths (as compared to total population) and percentage of positive tests seem like much better indications of how the state is doing at controlling/surviving the virus.
And Memorial Day Weekend infections haven’t even shown up yet. This isn’t even our final form!
Yay....oh wait!
Well of course. I see full of ppl in the community swimming pool and basketball court. Duh. Expected.
https://www.wral.com/coronavirus/  -new deaths going down (See Tracking the coronavirus curve in NC chart)  https://www.wral.com/coronavirus/coronavirus-in-nc-live-updates-for-june-1-2020/19123825/  >11:15 a.m.: North Carolina more than doubled the number of coronavirus tests administered in May compared to the month before. In April, 128,517 tests were given. In May, there were 287,772 tests. The percentage of positive tests has remained steady at 6.9%.  -we're doubling our number of tests  https://www.heraldsun.com/news/coronavirus/article243199091.html  >The number of patients hospitalized by COVID-19 jumped by 66 to 716. That information came as **89%** of hospitals reported data on Tuesday, **compared to 75% on Monday**.  >State officials said 77% of ventilators are available while 27% of hospital beds and 20% of intensive care beds are available. Those are signs the state’s healthcare system has room to accommodate new COVID-19 patients should a spike in cases occur.  -More hospitals reporting numbers, so that explains increase in hospitalizations, they're also reporting they have the capacity to deal with future surges  -It would be nice if y'all gave a more complete picture with these various Covid posts in here
And yet we only have 1,008 Covid RELATED deaths out of a population of 10,000,000.
I would not take only one statistic into consideration.

Uh, yeah. We have a massive problem if we have more new cases than New York and California which have massively larger populations. This is about the number of new cases per population. Dumb people don't math real good and that's one of the reason this state is so damn pathetic.
97 deaths per mill.    https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us/
Here is the source: https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us/
I'm sorry, but I absolutely do not feel sad about the process of natural selection. I am not UN-Happy about mobs of morons literally dying from the result of being morons.
% positive has been gradually increasing and is now a little over 9% ( https://covid19.ncdhhs.gov/dashboard/testing ).  I think the last time the percentage positive was on a downward trend was mid -May.  Every day we have reset the 14 day counter since then.
>Uh, yeah. We have a massive problem if we have more new cases than New  York and California which have massively larger populations.   Oddly enough, I clicked the source link and California is currently #1 with 3600 new cases, New York is #4 with 1464 new cases, and NC is #6 with 1220 new cases.  So I suppose we don't have a massive problem?  Maybe the issue is that this was posted at 2 PM EST and being 11 AM in CA, they hadn't reported numbers yet?  >This is about the number of new cases per population. Dumb people don't math real good and that's one of the reason this state is so damn pathetic.  The post didn't mention new cases per population, it only mentioned total new cases and NC being in the top 10 consistently. Given that NC ranks #9 in the US by population, it should be no surprise that we could be in the top 10 for new COVID-19 cases.  Now maybe if someone was posting things regarding the new cases per capita, then you could call people dumb and refer to the state as pathetic.  However, in the absence of that, the only one presenting poorly is you.  Jumping to conclusions and resorting to insults immediately isn't productive and doesn't make North Carolinians look good.
Thanks. Actually puts NC in a more favourable light, as compared to the selective statistics gathering in the photo. NC is number 11 for total test administered, so naturally it's going to find more cases if it tests more people. And it's way down the list in terms of deaths per million people.  I'm not saying we couldn't/shouldn't do all that we can, but OP makes it sound like we're doing comparatively bad, but the data makes it look like we're doing comparatively good. We're also in the bottom half when looking at total cases adjusted per million residents. Of course total cases remains more a function of total tests than of actual cases, but it still shows that overall you have to tweak that data hard to make it look like NC is doing worse with this than the rest of the country.
🏅
Dumb people also don't read real good either: >if we have more new cases than New York and California
And we don't so I don't really see your point.  Unless it is that you don't read good.
The word "IF" is critical here.

NC’s COVID-19 cases peak for third day in a row as completed tests near 500,000

Of course. I see more ppl hang out w/o mask. Basketball court, pool, bar, restaurant, etc.  it is not just because of increased number if testing. Ppl started ignoring COVID-19.
Ever since phase 2, people have been walking around and acting like the virus no longer exists. I'm not surprised.
The most important missing statistic is non-covid deaths compared to 10 year average. Apparently non Covid pneumonia deaths are like 500% above average.   Also, apparently a lot of deaths aren’t getting reported. If a patient is considered non resident, their death doesn’t get reported.
So as we greatly increase testing, the number of positive cases increase. And we know that testing asymptotic people in a low prevalence population gives us 25-50% false positive results.
I doubt it.  Testing has really increased and a large majority of the new cases are still in more closed up big cities like Charlotte and Raleigh, although the "more" closed up aspect is more a personal choice.
>	If a patient is considered non resident, their death doesn’t get reported.  Not true. The jurisdiction of residence is notified and the death is reported there.
Do you have a source on pneumonia deaths?
The numbers that really matter are hospitalizations and ICU bed/ventilator availability IMO.
The percentage positive is increasing and hasn't downtrended since Memorial Day.    If everything was okay, percentage positive wouldn't be increasing as we tested more.
Are you quoting what Dr. Birx said in response to why they aren't pushing for more tests? Because she is citing a Chinese science paper about their own tests, not our own. Not only that, but that paper has been redacted from the science journal it was published in.
The phenomenon you describe about false positivity is really an issue with lower cost, broadly administered serology i.e. antibody tests that aren’t part of our testing strategy or COVID-19 case definition.  However, academic partners in the state are performing sero-surveys to better estimate background prevalence.  The tests quoted and tracked by the state are PCR tests that detect and amplify SARS-2 RNA present in the sample. They are *extremely* specific and have high positive predictive value.
The % positive rate of asymptomatic pre op patients at a major hospital in the triangle is less than 1%, whereas over the last week symptomatic patients are testing positive at a 10+% rate. If anything, testing asymptomatic patients is increasing the denominator and pushing down the overall % rate
If it’s known, if the hospital reports it to that jurisdiction, and if that jurisdiction’s protocol includes reporting expatriate deaths.
Not handy but if you google pneumonia  deaths Above average 2020 you should find many. I think /u/prizedturkey told me first.
And both are climbing. Hospitalizations have been climbing since May 5th, and ICU utilization is now up over 85%. ICU usage is usually high (expensive and makes sense to keep full), but many places are not providing ventilator use data, and its not being presented by the state. Deaths are still climbing as well. Just because the media has moved on to the new hotness of the day doesn't mean COVID has gone away.
Not sure if you saw my previous post. The point I was making is that as testing of asymptotic people increases, the number of false positives increase. This can easily explain a less than 1% increase in positives with no real underlying increase in actual positives.
No, this is Bayes’ Theorem. The molecular based tests available in the US have a specificity of around 96%. With a prevalence of 5% you get about 35% false positive result.
This activity is standard for COVID reporting and does rely on hospitals, counties, and states coordinating. But it is routine. Source: intimately involved in our states COVID reporting.  I will say that this is the protocol for lab confirmed COVID cases. COVID-related mortality among people without a lab confirmed infection may well be under-ascertained.
How do you explain the number of hospitalizations going up then?
No it doesn’t. Doing more tests doesn’t change the percentages.
I don’t know whether what your saying is accurate, but even if it were, it only applies to absolute numbers. If infection rate is unchanged, percentage of positives should decrease with increased testing numbers.
My whole conversation concerns strictly non confirmed but likely covid deaths. These are vastly underreported.   And just because a reporting mechanism is standard doesn’t mean it’s accurate or the best mechanism. Lack of national coordination is one of the great shortcomings highlighted by this whole thing.
Idk if someone answered this question, but when the numbers jumped to 700+, the news said it was because 14 more hospitals started reporting their numbers.
He’s attempting to attribute the upward trend to statistical noise. It’s the next goal post after “of course there are more positives with more testing”.
There are some great articles on Bayes’ theorem that explain this. It’s not intuitive at all, but if you work through some examples you will see how this changes with prevalence and specificity.
I’d venture to say that our capacity to identify novel coronavirus infection and associated morbidity and mortality is much stronger now than even 2 months ago due to better logistical capacity and knowledge / general awareness among the health community and the public. These foundational things should improve all of the downstream reporting.
Capacity ne execution, and certainly not there today. There are plety of reported deaths that could well be covid but there is no positive test. And plenty of deaths which don’t show up anywhere. Source: doc (good friend) at a unc hospital.   How is nc capturing deaths not at hospitals?

A record 739 hospitalized with COVID-19 in NC; cases surge across the country

Haven't you guys heard? COVID is over because we got bored of it.
I went back to the office on June 1, and lemme tell ya, ain’t no ones wearing a mask, and people don’t seem to be bothering with 6-ft of social distance. We’re just gonna let this happen to us I think.
i thought i saw something on the news last night about that NC is not meeting it's phase 3 reopening thresholds -- something about a number being 10% but phase 3 requires it be 6% or under but i was cross buzzing and not really that focused
And yet soooo many people really need gyms, strip clubs and bars to be open. Ugh.   Numbers are just going to keep climbing unfortunately, especially with all of the protests lately.
This is what happens when you reopen too early, you morons.  I hope you enjoyed your brief restaurants and haircuts.
Increased infection rates tend to happen when groups of hundreds of people regularly convene in close proximity all around the state. People need to stop acting like there are no negatives to the protests as long as they're nonviolent.
739 out of 10 million.... in NC
That's about 4% of all current hospitalizations in the State, according to the data
The article is about going back to school. I was looking for the numbers in the title but tdidnt see them.
Had a meeting today where people were spouting off all kinds of shit about the virus not being dangerous...I spoke up and all they said was “I guess there are exceptions to the rule”   Fucking hell man.
Boomers have their haircuts and Applebees, all is right with the world
Just curious, you've been pretty vocal about taking this seriously when most conservatives are trying to downplay it. And you're one of the more vocal conservatives on this subreddit. Has the Republican response changed your view of them? You can DM a response if you prefer.
I think you're right.
NC never met Phase 2 thresholds either, but opened anyway...and here we are, two weeks after Memorial Day, spiking. NC hasn't even reached peak infections yet.
Cue the influx of comments about increased testing, false numbers, bizarre math theories in order to keep changing the narrative and moving those goal posts further and further out.
> soooo many people really need gyms  Yeah, some of us do.   Badly. As in it is part of our mental health regimen.   You simply cannot achieve the same workout with bodyweight and running that you can with heavy weight lifting. You just can't.  If other types of businesses can be open at reduced capacity, wipe down the equipment, social distancing, etc etc etc, so can gyms.
Too early for that. This is from re-opening.
Right? I support the cause but the protests are irresponsible. Protesting loss of one life at the cost of tens of thousands (or more).
Also according to the data:  739 is with only 77% of hospitals reporting.  Only 461 ICU beds are available out of a possible 3,223, only 14% available   Only 4244 inpatient hospital beds are available out of 17204, only 25% available    Flattening the curve means not overwhelming our hospitals and not exhausting every resource we have.
About halfway into the article.  > The number of people hospitalized with COVID-like symptoms across North Carolina has reached a new high. On Monday, the state reported 739 people in the hospital, the highest one-day total since the coronavirus pandemic began.
What’s your opinion of the protestors and social distancing?
I notice that you don’t call out the protesters who are gathering in the thousands every single day to protest against police brutality who are undoubtedly spreading the virus.   I know that PB is way more justified than wanting to get a haircut and go out to eat, but corona virus doesn’t care what the cause is. It’s still spreading.   So why do you only mention the haircuts and Applebee’s as if thats why the virus spread?   You are ignorant.
Millennial?
Well, first off, I'm not a Republican (I know you said "conservative", which I'd agree with, but I just wanted to make that distinction clear for anyone reading). I don't have party loyalty. I've been critical of Republicans for tons of stuff over the last decade. I did not vote for Trump in 2016, and I won't be voting for him in 2020.  Secondly, yes, I am extremely disappointed in countless politicians from the top down on how this issue has been addressed, handled and politicized, and that disappointment isn't bound by political parties, either. I'm disappointed in the President, my congressional and senate reps, our governor, and our GA.   I honestly feel like this could have been a time of unity- where we could set aside differences and combat a common enemy, much like wartime. And for maybe a few weeks it seemed like that could be the case. But that hope all came crashing down pretty quickly. I pledged to vote against all incumbents at the state and federal level in November prior to all this happening, and I still plan on doing that. It's just sad that we're in such a state of hyper-partisanship that we can't even come together during a crisis like this. Honestly, I fear for our future.
Now this is the truth. Pick a metric and stick with it.
You're making two different points:  1. Exercise is necessary for your mental health.  2. You cannot achieve the same workout with bodyweight and running that you can with heavy weight lifting.  On 1, it's not legitimately debated by anyone.  The benefits are clear, and you shouldn't be prevented from exercising even during a pandemic.  On 2, why is this relevant?  It's perfectly clear that your mental health can be optimized with running and bodyweight training.  [Here's a source](https://fitnessgenes.com/blog/5-mental-health-benefits-of-strength-training/) that makes pretty clear that mental health benefits are most pronounced for low-to-moderate intensity resistance training.  No such benefit for high intensity training, which includes heavy lifting.  [This source](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/nepdpm/lifting-weights-has-a-surprising-effect-on-mental-health) says there's no difference between 2 and 7 days per week, nor between light and heavy lifting.  The important part is the workout, not the intensity of it.  [This source](https://u.osu.edu/emotionalfitness/2017/10/20/weight-lifting-exercise-and-mental-health/) says the same thing.  As does [this source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4090891/).  [This source](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/244918384_Mental_Health_Benefits_of_Strength_Training_in_Adults) seems to disagree, but only insofar as they indicate that prolonged rest periods might dampen the quantifiable benefits of strength training because aerobic activity packs more work into the same time period.      So on balance, and from a public policy maker's perspective, the same mental health outcome can be achieved if people are restricted to working out at home, and physical health outcomes can also be improved if people are restricted to working out at home.  It's a no-brainer except in terms of the perceived importance of the exact nature of the exercise to the individual being affected by the closure.  From an aggregate perspective it makes sense to protect the health of many, even if that means inconveniencing a few power lifters in the process.  Edit to add an analogy:   - "But I can't get the same quality workout from home!"  is equally as irrelevant to this discussion as...  - "But I can't get the same quality food from home!"  Working out is important, and so is food. Still doesn't make this particular argument salient in this scenario.
Protests are not about the loss of one life. Come on.  And, nearly every protester is wearing a mask.
Thanks!
It's almost as if some things are important to protest about. I should also mention that the protesters are generally all wearing masks (unlike the REOPEN people).
Almost all protesters are wearing masks in public. Makes a huge difference.
I know you are but what am I?
So voting against all incumbents means voting for Forest over Cooper. When Forest says things like:      "You know, we’ve still had more deaths to the flu this year than we’ve had COVID-19,” Forest said, adding: “There’s been about three times more deaths for HIV/AIDS, remember that was a pandemic at one tiwme that still has no vaccine. This one’s bad. It’s obviously worse than the normal flu year, but it hasn’t hit the extremes of other pandemics yet.”      . “His mandate will devastate our economy, shutter many small businesses, and leave many people unemployed, especially in the rural areas of our state where food supply is already critical,” he said in a news release.      “no moral, ethical, or rational justification” for a policy that slow-walks a return to the post-pandemic normal is that because COVID-19 is only killing those who already have other illnesses, there is no justification for shutting down the state’s economy to protect their lives.    It seems that Forest would rather go the route of Florida and Georgia and do nothing, while you think Cooper hasn't been proactive enough, is that a fair assessment? Just trying to understand your view here.      Edit - I agree this shouldn't have been politicized. It seems that science is now up for political interpretation (though that has been debated before, we are able to test this more quickly on a smaller scale than something like global warming)
The governor and staff has been consistent in their message that no one metric is being considered to the exclusion of others. That said, hospitalizations is the one that concerns me the most. And in today’s press conference they emphasized that number. When hospitals, and ICUs in particular, become overwhelmed, that’s when we’re in trouble.
BuT mUh RePs!
Sounds like they are scared of cardio
You're right it's not just about one life. But it still doesn't outweigh the loss of life we will see because millions chose to group together for multiple days. And masks are only one small part of our defense against the virus. One of the most important being proper hygiene. Do you think protesters that spent all day on the street were able to properly wash their hands?
Really? They're almost all wearing masks? I mean I'm sure a lot more of them are wearing them than REOPEN people, but I still find that hard to believe.
No it’s not almost all. It’s probably about 65/35 wearing a mask cause not from what I’ve seen. Even if it was 100%, wearing a mask when 2 inches apart from people in a crowd is still much much worse than staying at home.   For the record, I think the protests are a good thing, and I think wanting to re open businesses is a good thing. But both are bad when it comes to spreading the virus and anyone who thinks one is okay and the other is not is ignorant.
The Brevard White Squirrel?
Forest and Cooper are not the only ones on the ballot. I'll be voting for Steven DiFiore, the Libertarian candidate for NC Governor. I realize that this is mostly a protest vote and his likelihood of being elected is essentially zero, but I can simply not come to terms with supporting either Forest or Cooper, who are both culpable for the current condition of our state.
New infections I would say is a leading indicator to hospitalizations
You are right. It’s not a great situation. I wish they didn’t need to do it.
In every protest organization flyer or post I’ve seen, it always says WEAR A MASK. And it sure looks like a ton of masks out there.
I mean, they’re protesting in support of health & safety for all, so surely it’s not that much of a stretch to think they would slip on a bit of cloth to protect others?
I'd say at least 80-90% of people were wearing masks for the protests I've attended - though sometimes people will pull them off for a bit.  Anecdotal, though.
Hmm?
True, but we don’t have a reliable way to measure new infections. New positive test results is a factor of the number of tests being done and may not reflect new cases, but may just reveal otherwise undetected cases. Percent positives is a better number, but still subject to being skewed by how the tests are distributed. Even so, percent positive has hovered between about 7 and 10 percent for a while. But hospitalizations is on the rise. Until we can actually test everyone, we have to make educated guesses based on those numbers.
That's pretty good and better than I expected. I was thinking closer to 60-70 based on pictures.
More like yuuuummmmmm amirite
If hospitalizations have gone up it stands to reason that we’re more toward 10% or have possibly breached that number.
I do want to emphasize that it is entirely anecdotal - Greensboro might just have more mask coverage for the protests than other cities.
10% is a known number. We don’t have to guess whether we’ve breached it. It’s the number of positive tests in comparison to all the tests processed on that day.  It actually was over 10% back in April or March, and it’s been hovering right at the 10% line lately, so we could go higher at any time.
May be anecdotal but seems a lot more reasonable and likely than people acting like every protestor is wearing a mask. I totally support the cause, there's just no way that's true.
Ahhh, I see what you mean. North Carolina has seen protests starting with OpenNC ( I think that’s right) to the present so it makes sense that we’re at or close to that 10%. Hopefully not higher but it wouldn’t surprise me.    Thank you for that clarification.

Gov. Cooper to get tested for COVID-19 Tuesday

Well wishes to the Governor. I think he’s done a pretty decent job throughout all of this.
Setting the right example. I fully support this.
Best wishes and fingers crossed!

North Carolina’s hospitalizations from coronavirus continue to grow. The state hit a record high for hospitalizations Tuesday, with 774 people currently in the hospital with severe COVID-19 symptoms -- 35 more than the number reported Monday, setting a record for the fourth time in June.

To be expected. The goal is to prevent hospitals from being overwhelmed, and we're still no where close to that
Cases actually dropped dramatically yesterday.  Doesn't mean they won't go up again but it's a positive number  As of 6/9:   [https://covid19.ncdhhs.gov/dashboard/cases](https://covid19.ncdhhs.gov/dashboard/cases)
Approximately 0.000774% of the population.
So? They’re still people, 774 actually.

White House concerned by NC’s lack of COVID-19 testing

Is this a joke? The White House lost their right to be concerned long ago.
Dr. Birx is not a trump stooge & she is not wrong. Is it fair to single out NC? Probably not and I doubt she's telling the state anything they don't already understand. However more testing is needed because we are moving into a phase where we have to be reactive to COVID-19 because we are losing the will to be preventative (social distancing and business closures).
You put the blame squarely on the GOP. They are trying at every turn to open the state up even more.  Cooper is doing everything he can to keep the state closed or reopen it safely.  Just look at the legislation being pushed by the Senate GOP.
Aren’t we testing a lot more people than the average state?
So the McPresident is concerned about the media induced hoax now is he?  His doofus worshippers are about to start dying in droves and they need some way to distort the facts, to deflect blame. Gaslight, Obstruct and Project. GOP. The McPresident and his cronies have no standing to make any argument whatsoever regarding this pandemic.  Meanwhile the McPresident is busy contaminating tests: https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-coronavirus-swabs-puritan-maine-thrown-out-2020-6
lmao WOW
Bcuz cooper doesn’t care he just wants us shutdown till November
Cases actually dropped dramatically yesterday.  Doesn't mean they won't go up again but it's a positive number  As of 6/9:   [https://covid19.ncdhhs.gov/dashboard/cases](https://covid19.ncdhhs.gov/dashboard/cases)
The original plan was 30 days to slow the spread so hospitals weren’t overwhelmed, they’re not overwhelmed right now so we should reopen...why stay closed forever and destroy the economy? I don’t think you’ve noticed but unemployment benefits doesn’t last forever lots of peoples are running out now and we have to go back to work...we don’t live off the government that’s socialism...we work for a living dude...
Average state in US has tested a total of 67,871 per million people. NC has tested 52,788 per million people. So *overall* less than average but the number per day has gone up almost 3 fold in the past month.    https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us/
Why November?
I think at this point the value lies in trend lines of all metrics.
Just from briefly glancing at the chart, it looks like most of our tuesdays have lower numbers reported
I would not get hung up on daily reporting, as that is not a good metric to measure trends.   Besides the infection rate is only 1 piece of the puzzle, and we are missing lots of testing. The one that really matters is below:  https://covid19.ncdhhs.gov/dashboard/hospitalizations
He wants to get re elected but I doubt he’ll win at this point
Look at total tests as well for yesterday.  That was a high number.
Yeah, I’ve mostly been following the WaPo numbers, and while the last few days have been good, the ones before that were horrendous. I’ll start to relax when the actual trend line starts to look good.
Every poll says otherwise, currently by a margin too big to be wrong.
His approval rating is basically flat from Where he started though. He took a small dip from the veto, which would have eroded his powers to manage this crisis, but they were generally increasing prior to that.
Well I guess I should move to South Carolina where there is freedom, no socialism or dictatorship :)
Well if he gets re-elected he’ll probably just keep bars and gyms closed forever...he’s a dictator
Yeah, have fun with that.
Yes please do. And take your moronic comments over to r/southcarolina as well!
You make a strong argument here. Maybe a future as a news moderator is  coming soon?

Hospital officials say they are ready as number of COVID-19 cases continue to rise

This has gotten lost in all this, but the shutdown was not only to prepare hospitals for large intakes, although that was a major component.  The other major component of the shutdown strategy, in other countries anyways, is to use that time to drastically increase production of testing capabilities and to create a robust contact tracing process.  As a country we did a half assed job at best with our shutdown and now it's coming back to bite us. It is crucial that we get the second half of the shutdown strategy in place or we'll be a minimum of 2 weeks behind on where outbreaks are occurring and just how bad they are.
>The number of people hospitalized in our state is a new high. And while beds are filling up across the state, experts say **they expected this with the state reopening** and protests happening and they are prepared for more cases to follow.  -I thought the point of the initial lockdowns was to prepare hospitals for this very thing, and the hospitals themselves are saying they are ready.   >Duke, WakeMed and UNC Hospitals continue to see new patients. But all three hospitals say they have plenty of capacity, and as the state begins to reopen and in light of the recent protests, all three hospitals expect to see more cases.  >“We are really far away from seeing these hospitals getting to at capacity levels in terms of beds, icu beds or ventilators," Dukes said.   -I'm confused on the (media and others) messaging on this. I keep seeing reports of rising hospitalizations and that hospitals have sufficient capacity, in the same page.   -So if we didn't reopen in early May, then what, the hospitals would just stay empty? How long were we supposed to keep them below normal capacity? I know they have various funding issues as now as well, I'm not sure how much Federal aid was going to keep them afloat.
>"But at this point in time, with only 84 percent of hospitals reporting, experts said we’re still in good shape should we see a spike."  Amazing, really, how the goal posts have moved.  Having done a half-assed job with the so-called "shut down," now it's just about not overwhelming hospitals indefinitely.  As in, "We're happy to have 800-1000 people die every day, so long as our hospitals can cope."  The USA has just given up on fighting this virus, has moved on to other things (Americans' attention spans are measured in hours, anyway, so perhaps it's a miracle some people are still concerned about this virus at all), and now the strategy is to just give up and wait for .56% of the population to die or for herd immunity to kick in.  Everything in the USA is such shit, it's really amazing.  The country that could focus, mobilize, and put a man on the effing moon now can't do better than Slovakia or Lebanon when it comes to protecting its citizens from a virus, even when it had months to prepare (which were squandered).  Seriously, the country is total shit, and the rich are just robbing everyone blind now before it all hits the fan.
"But at this point in time, with only 84 percent of hospitals reporting, experts said we’re still in good shape should we see a spike."  I think we can all safely return to normal with some precautions. I wouldn't let these "record" numbers scare you, it's just the fact that we have to reopen at some point and deal with things the best we can.
The article fails to mention that cases dropped dramatically yesterday and percent positive dropped also.  As of 6/9:   [https://covid19.ncdhhs.gov/dashboard/cases](https://covid19.ncdhhs.gov/dashboard/cases)
> increase production of testing capabilities   I can't speak for contact tracing, but NC has dramatically increased its testing capacity:  https://abc11.com/nc-coronavirus-cases-governor-coroanvirus-test/6231685/  >In the past few weeks, the state has dramatically increased testing with drive-thru events and partnerships with retail chains.  >Castlight, the company partnering with North Carolina to track testing locations, found on May 14 only 21% of counties in North Carolina had testing sites. Of the counties that did have access to testing, only 1 out of 5 was meeting the recommended testing minimums.  >A week after the study, North Carolina flipped its status from reporting some of the fewest counties in the nation with access to testing to some of the most. Castlight found 90% of counties now have testing sites, and a majority are able to meet recommended testing minimums.
While you're not incorrect, I also I think it's probably a prominent story due to the fact that even though an increase was expected and been prepared for, it still means impacts on peoples lives and the loss of life as well. There's also the fear of the preparation still not being enough. We're in somewhat uncharted territory with this.
There probably aren’t many (any) people still alive that experienced the Great Influenza of 1918/1919. We don’t have any reference point.
The original stated goal was to buy time for hospitals to prepare. The moved goal posts happened earlier, when some people decided that we were aiming for eradication. This is just us returning to the original stated goal of the lockdown.
Because of day of testing variance. Looking at that graph it is anything but smooth with a repeating pattern of spikes and dips.  Use the 7 day average.  Saying we had a drop one day is disingenuous at best.
The graph/data appears to indicate a steadily rising infection trend, over a period of 3 months, with the largest group infected being white people between the age of 25-49.  Interesting. It is worth noting that if we had not taken the actions that we did to prevent the spread, the rate would be even worse. It is improbable that the infection rate will decrease from this point on the average given that so many people are ignoring, or have been forced to give up on social distancing etc. Given the data we have available, it appears this is going to get much worse.
I was just reading this about Wisconsin, who opened up before we did:  https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusMN/comments/gzecnp/wisconsin_update_0_new_coronavirus_deaths_today/  (remember all those videos of the packed bars there)
looks like cases went down again today compared to last Wednesday, if I'm reading this right
True, we have greatly increased testing, but the testing that is done, depending on the test you get, has a 2-5 day lag on the results. And testing is only effective if we then use that information to do contact tracing.  To actually be proactive on where an outbreak is occurring we need to be able to test someone and get results within a matter of hours, not days, and in the event of a positive test we then need to be able to inform the people who could've been exposed.  This part of the shutdown strategy necessitates a coordinated national effort on the part of the federal government and that doesn't seem to be something we can expect to see anytime soon, but that doesn't change the fact that unless and until we have the capabilities outlined above we're always going to be reacting to outbreaks instead of being proactive.
What he is leaving out is while the three largest hospital systems in NC are ready to take more patients, it's very unlikely that say the hospital system of Dare county (which never could take COVID patients) would be ready for it.   So yes, while Duke, UNC and Wake can take additional patients, it is highly concerning if all hospitals int he state cannot (which they cant).
So you're a glass is half empty person.  I was trying to make something positive out of it, but keep being you...
> *steadily rising* infection trend, over a period of 3 months  > it appears this is going to get much worse.  IIRC, at the beginning of this, we were fearing a hockey stick-like infection/hospitalization rate. Our lockdowns "flattened the curve" to  a more "gentle" sloping increasing rate. Which I thought was the goal
Younger whites makes sense given they were the ones doing most of the reopening in the state- both working and going to places.  At least that's the group most likely to have milder symptoms.
Except as others have said, Wisconsin and Georgia, the lagging indicators are quite high, so they could soon see a spike of cases. Additionally, the dynamics of Wisconsin are quite different than NC (half the population, much less travel). Whereas somewhere like Arizona with a higher population, older population, and one with a lot of travel, as asking hospitals to engage their emergency plans, as they are getting very close to having hospitals overwhelmed with COVID cases.   It's almost like with many things in the US, that since we are not one unified and homogeneous country from shore to shore, individual state plans have a massive effect on the outcomes of the virus, along with how people adhere to those plans.
June 3 there were 888 cases, today there were 1,011
Also a very valid point. Smaller hospitals sometimes struggle at the best of times.
Not at all.  I view my self as a realist who sets reasonable expectations.   I am also a bio big-data analyst professionally.  You are seeing a repeating trend due to how data is collected and calling it a meaningful outcome when every other metric indicates it is just the normal variance.   Spreading false hope is a great way to piss people off when that gets dashed with reality.  And I think disengenious was a perfect word.  Either you're smart and know what you are saying is misleading or your dumb and you shouldn't be saying anything on the matter.  Which is it?
Indeed, and it is the goal. It appears to have had the intended effect so far, although some groups have largely ignored the measures that were put in place/suggested/ordered.  I can't help but wonder what it's going to be like when the regular flu season comes around with this bizzarro virus floating around also.
Responding to OP above you  >it's very unlikely that say the hospital system of Dare county (which never could take COVID patients) would be ready for it.  As for Dare County, this is from May 14th; not sure if things have dramatically changed for them though:   https://www.wavy.com/news/north-carolina/dare-county-preps-hospitals-and-beaches-for-visitors-set-to-arrive-on-saturday/  >As more people come to visit, **county leaders say hospitals are now prepared for a possible surge in cases**. Before, county leaders were worried about overwhelming hospitals with limited supplies.  >“The surge plan looks at all of the hospitals in the given region; how many beds do you have available, how many hospitalizations are there, how many do you expect throughout the region? You then move the patients where there are beds … that surge capacity is there to move the people to a hospital somewhere within the surge capacity plan to deal with the issues that you might expect with that size population. That was not the case back in March when we started,” said Robert Outten, the Dare County manager.
"And I think disengenious was a perfect word. Either you're smart and know what you are saying is misleading or your dumb and you shouldn't be saying anything on the matter. Which is it?"     I'd suggest taking a class in formal logic, cause it seems ya missed signing up for one when you picked up your degree.  Or you're intelligent and intentionally using logical fallacies. Which is it?
My doctorate in CompSci tells me I'm smart.  You're also a liberal which tells me that you are indeed a glass is half empty person.
Yup it's a false dilemma fallacy, and yes it was intentionally used.
😂
So you're smart enough to know you're using bad logic to win arguments, rather than using that intellect to discover the truth.   Yea, I'm done here. Keep winning internet points 😂
u/Heroine4Life if neither your or his degree are relevant to data analytics (with yours being a chemistry degree?), why did you appeal to your job, which you do not have a degree for and only a title?
The case was presented before the fallacy.  Fallacy fallacy on your part, should I conclude everything you said is meaningless as you did?
You dont see how work experience in data analysis would be relevant to the discussion here?  Also biochem isn't chemistry, its biochem.  Which is how I have experience with how diagnostics are done (besides my years of doing medical diagnostic r&d work).  Do I need to explain why that may be relevant to intureptting medical diagnostic results?  Edit.  I also didnt give my title.  I gave a job description.  My title is Study Director (which my degree is relevant towards).  Not really relevant as titles vary by company, and why I gave the relevant job duty.
" The case was presented before the fallacy."  Again, I recommend taking a class in formal logic, because you're bad at it.   The "case" is called a "premise", and the "conclusion" of that premise was he's either stupid and shouldn't talk, or smart and knows what he's saying is misleading or dumb. That's why I called you out. You appeal to your title/role and assert others are stupid or trolls.   The "no me, you!" response is classic as well.   " conclude everything you said is meaningless as you did?"     I'm not concluding everything you said is meaningless. I'm concluding you're here to use your big brain for winning arguments and getting internet points (by appealing to authority, your title, your job, your degree) all while insulting others, and that I don't want to engage with you. That's all.
\> The "case" is called a "premise",  Semantics argument.  Yup, you are right, and pointless.  \> and the "conclusion" of that premise was he's either stupid and shouldn't talk, or smart and knows what he's saying is misleading or dumb.  That wasn't the conclusion.  But an odd 1 sentence you are focusing on.  \> You appeal to your title/role and assert others are stupid or trolls.  I didn't appeal to authority to call someone dumb, but to explain how analysis is done generally for things like this.  \> The "no me, you!" response is classic as well.  So is your pseudo intellectualism which doesn't actually contradict the argument made but opinion statements around it and argue semantics.  \> I'm concluding you're here to use your big brain for winning arguments and getting internet points (by appealing to authority, your title, your job, your degree) all while insulting others, and that I don't want to engage with you. That's all.  Pot-kettle.
" Semantics argument. Yup, you are right, and pointless."  What? I clarified its your premise (and is called a premise) because you were trying to assert that your premise (or "case" as you called it) was separate from your conclusion. This is clearly the point I made, and your continuous mental gymnastics to justify your position is tiring.  Instead of isolating parts of my sentences or the side points within my comments, perhaps you can use big brain to understand that the only reason I commented (I'll say it again) is because you were claiming to be a rational realist, while knowingly using bad logic to assert others are dumb or trolls. Period. Full stop.  There's no pot calling a kettle black, because I'm not using bad logic to insult you. I'm pointing out you're using bad logic to insult others. Again, go to class.
The conclusion was on the data interpretation not as a judgement of the character.  That was my own opinion, and yeah it used the the false dilemma fallacy.   If you have a problem with that, then demonstrate the other outcome, which is the interpretation was correct.  Which was OPs position which didn't have any support for it.  You can't argue against a baseless position.  \> Instead of isolating parts of my sentences or the side points within my comments,  Is literally what you did...  \> while knowingly using bad logic to assert others are dumb or trolls.  I can understand your position to a point if you remove it from the entire context of the discussion.  \> There's no pot calling a kettle black, because I'm using bad logic to insult you.

Fact check: Trump blames testing for spike in COVID-19 cases. Experts fault reopening of states

The large groups of people gathering in the streets may have something to do with it.
Removed: rule 5
It mentions North Carolina specifically in the article. How does this violate Rule 5?  EDIT: NVM, I see Rule 5.e where it could be covered there. I still feel it is a relavent article, but I understand.

An Alamance County judge has issued a temporary restraining order on Ace Speedway amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

Not surprised. These orders keep being held up in NC, unless it's something protected by the constitution, such as churches and protesting.
Turns out stupid is a risk to human life. Stop stupid now. Join the campaign to stop stupid now. Contact your local anti-stupid chapter to put an end to stupid wherever it exists. We are not the not strongest when we are not the stupidest.
Didn't Ace Speedway misuse that exception? They claimed it was a protest.
And the church thing wasn't because of their inherent status as churches, it was because other establishments (aka businesses) were allowed to operate but they couldn't to the same extent.  So the issue was uneven application of restrictions, not that it was illegal to restrict access to houses of worship.  To quote the judge who put the restraining order into effect (bolded emphasis mine):  >"**No constitutional right-including the right of free exercise of religion-is absolute**. ... Individual liberties, "under the pressure of great dangers," may be reasonably restricted "as the safety of the general public may demand.  >"This court does not doubt that the Governor is acting in good faith to lessen the spread of COVID-19 and to protect North Carolinians.But restrictions inexplicably applied to one group and exempted from another do little to further these goals and do much to burden religious freedom."  In other words, if Cooper hadn't started relaxing restrictions only on businesses, then it seems that the judge would have upheld continued restrictions on places of worship (if churches went to sue in those circumstances) since they were made in good faith to protect the public.  Certainly the existence of 1A gave more weight to this interest, but it's not really the issue at hand.
Isn’t it great, these kinds of things are just an unnecessary risk, especially as cases are on the up in NC.
The government can still block protesting, they just couldn't allow say fans at a sporting event and then block BLM protestors, that's what more or less got them in trouble with Religious groups and forced an injunction during Phase 2, but even the churches were shutdown in Phase 1. Of course being able to block, and having the political will to do it aren't quite the same thing
Call me crazy, or bitterly cynical, but I fully believe there will be a protest due in part to this.
Well legislators are helping businesses. Except instead of helping small businesses and people who have been affected by the pandemic, they instead decided to give the money to companies that tend to have enough bought back their own stocks. So they really aren't helping.
You aren't. We will.   We had guys walking around with automatic weapons complaining that they couldn't get a hair cut. I can see people holding protest demanding we be allowed to see cars drive in circles while sitting in a crowded stand.
Under the same law carrying a brick during a protest is just as illegal as a gun.   "any object that can cause serious bodily harm or death".

To the surprise of no one.
As predicted by everyone that's not an idiot.
If only that had been as entirely predictable as it was entirely unnecessary. Speedy recovery and all, but risking that for something so trivial is foolishness.

How Richard Burr Made $185,000 During the Covid-19 Pandemic — GovTrades.com

Corruption
Turns out being a worthless piece of crap is quite profitable.
Dick Burr's on his way out and $185,000 isn't even that much money;  I hope Tillis is crushed in November.
Burr decided to do what he did because the fines would be cheaper than taking that huge loss with his investments.
I like to call his office and leave messages about how we’re hitting all time highs now.... “was it really worth it little buddy?!”
How the fuck this guy won his last election Pisses me off
Unacceptable.
Maybe to some, but $185K is 3.5x the annual income of the median North Carolina family he represents.
Bank $185K on every insider tip over a several-term career and that's how you go from selling mowers to being a millionaire. And without having to bother with any actual legislating on behalf of your constituents! Thanks for your indifference. Your GOP masters count on that.

How much has COVID-19 spread in Charlotte since Phase 2 reopening? Here’s the data.

/u/manmortis this article and data might help provide you some of the answers you have been asking about. It's a lot to read and digest for sure, but mostly just deals with the Charlotte area.
Thank you. This is good information. Meck county is slowly approaching tripling Wake County's numbers despite having close to the same population numbers and also following the same state guidelines for reopening.  Do you have any theories on why that is?  Personally, there is a lot of good data out there, but there is also a lot that is not adding up. I hope you are willing to examine things in a way where you can see that. All I'm trying to do is find those holes and help things add up a little better.  For instance:  \- Why have deaths in NC begun a steep decline almost as soon as Phase 2 started (almost a month ago)?  It would seem if opening up was a major driver of the spread, then deaths would have also increased at this time. They did not.  \- Could NC's increase in % positive (which started on May 19th) have anything to do with the fact that also on May 19th [DHHS issued a recommendation for all Long Term Care Facilities](https://www.northcarolinahealthnews.org/2020/05/19/nc-dhhs-recommends-testing-in-nursing-homes-but-questions-remain/) to begin mass testing?  \- At first, it didn't seem that mass testing Long Term Care Facilities would show any increase of % positive since that demographic isn't being infected at a higher rate, they are just dying at a higher rate. But my thinking changed when...  \- Dr. Cohen explained in [this press conference](https://www.c-span.org/video/?473096-1/north-carolina-governor-cooper-coronavirus-news-conference) (30:26 mark) that private LTC facilities are not pro-actively testing unless they already have a confirmed case. As we've seen, when LTC facilities get a case, they are a lot of times part of a larger outbreak.  So do you see why if this process was established on May 19th,  and on May 19th NC's % positive began its rise, one would assume the two are connected in some way?  That's all I'm asking for. DHHS has an awfully hard job and they are in a tough spot. But iI would just shut up and quit asking questions if they'd just bring these points up and discuss why they aren't talking about these, what I consider, major facts and major decisions that affect the data collection process.  While we're at it, I'd also like to know why they aren't collecting symptomatic vs asymptomatic numbers. Most states are. And why they aren't giving up "new hospitalizations intake numbers"
I think the main reason why deaths have been in decline is that the proportion of cases in young people has gone up. In [early April](https://www.newsobserver.com/news/coronavirus/article241800456.html), people under 50 made up 51% of cases. [Now](https://covid19.ncdhhs.gov/dashboard/cases) they make up 65% of all cases.
One thing to look at too is what % of the numbers aren't LTC residents. That is what isn't being talked about. Basically it's everyone else - the person you passed in walmart, the guy buying a slim jim and a 40 at the gas station (me in 2 hours), the couple at the supermarket. LTC is one piece to the puzzle.
Let me just play devil's advocate to the Charlotte article....     * Cases are up because testing is up    *  % positive is up because of what I explained above    * Hospitalizations are up because normal hospital census is up *(elective surgeries have resumed and more people are returning to hospitals for normal reasons after neglecting their problems during shutdown).* And those coming in for other reasons, a small portion of them are testing positive with slight or no symptoms. ***(Seeing as how NET NEW hospitalizations only rises by an average of 11 people per day over the past week - that stat is statewide)***  Maybe these are all a reach. **Why not just assume that the virus is just spreading more?**  Because this virus is acting differently in a few states than it is nationally where cases/hospitalizations and deaths are all in massive decline. In fact, **last week was the first week we recorded less than 1000 deaths since March**.  And because NC's death 7-day rolling average continues it's decline.  Now, I think it's important to understand that this 'devil's advocate'' view isn't proven at all. But just assuming NC's numbers rising is bc we opened up isn't the right move either. It's important to have multiple theories as you watch the data play out.  Let's see what is right and what is wrong.  Maybe % positive is valid. As we start opening up mass testing sites and jobs start coming back online, we will see a better picture of our state's total population being tested.  Maybe % positive stays flat at 10%. If it does we have a problem and we need to fix it. Or maybe as you test more likely negative  people, % positive declines  Maybe hospitalizations are increasing because of a new surge in serious cases across the state. We can try to confirm that by looking at 'deaths'...which is our final metric.  If over the next 2 weeks we see the 7 day rolling average on deaths begin to trend up, in accordance with cases/testing/%pos/hospitalizations, then we will know the virus is spreading and w need to rethink actions.  However, if that doesn't not happen and if deaths decrease or stay flat then you don't' need to feel perplexed. You can look to the reasons above and start to examine those, Did they play a role? Did the virus become less lethal for some reason [as a top Dr. in Italy has suggested](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-italy-virus/new-coronavirus-losing-potency-top-italian-doctor-says-idUSKBN2370OQ)?
Thanks for the response. I definitely am not saying you are wrong. You could definitely be right on. I mean it definitely seems that way on the surface.  But I think it's important to look at potentials shortcomings too and be open to the idea that there could be problems with what is informing the data. That's all I'm suggesting. It's worth keeping an open mind about as we watch this unfold.   I am not so quick to point to bar scenes. Meck still doesn't have bars/nightclubs open and nationally as we see places opening up with massive gatherings, we aren't seeing the same spike across the board.   Heck, you had massive protests in every major city that went on for weeks. If that isn't sending the nation into a second wave, then it's hard for me to see how bars are doing it NC.   Right now you have 7 to 11 states that seem like outliers. But they are not the most open states. They are not the most dense states. So what is going on? Why did Minnesota only report 387 cases yesterday? They have had massive protests across the state for weeks now.   So, I think a lot is just not adding up and I think it's time to start digging into the data a little more to see if we can find any problems.

I agree on a base level. However, people who actually give a fuck aren’t prioritized over people like these assholes when it’s time for medical treatment.   Fucking. Selfish.

Help with Drivers license during COVID 19


UNC systems have added an addendum to housing contracts so students won't get refunds if housing is closed due to COVID-19.

I hope they have to give a blatant notification to students so they can choose off campus housing that won’t evict them without a refund.
This is bullshit.
This is why I’m telling a lot of kids who I know that graduated this year to take a gap year or go community college for a year to avoid all of the BS we are about to see from 4 year universities.  I understand the value of an education I have two degrees, but there is no value in possibly having to take online classes while paying full tuition and living in dorms you might get kicked out of while not receiving a refund.
This is shameful.
This is way shittier than you think.  At this point students do not know which classes for fall THAT THEY ARE CURRENTLY signed up for will be on campus or will be online.  A student could have signed up for classes in the spring, got housing sorted only to find out that all their classes are online in the fall.
Reminds me of the time that I got called into bootcamp in the middle of the semester. They charged me $4000 for leaving early. This school will penny and dime you to death. Would not recommend.  edit: spelling.
Has this been reported on by any news outlets? If not, I’d call them. If so, can we get a link or something so we can share?
So they kick you out in the middle of a pandemic with no money and no where to live, although you have already paid for housing. They just take the money and run, good plan.
Needs to be challenged I don't see how colleges aren't basically landlords and held to the same standards. IE warranty of habitability, etc.
Jesus Christ, I am so fucking glad I graduated when I did. The bullshit these students are having to put up with nowadays is unparalleled.
Good luck affording an apartment near UNC unless you are fine living in a 3 bedroom with 17 people. The apartment communities around here are ruthless with pricing and love to tack on all sorts of fees.    My girlfriend and I have a 2 bedroom since we have a small home based business and use one of the rooms for an office. Our rent is over $1500 a month, plus required $100 internet / cable, $45 trash, and greatly inflated water/sewer that's more than $100/mo. She got laid off from UNC Memorial Hospital due to Covid, and when her unemployment runs out, my full time job as a graphic designer will barely cover just rent + utilities. And that's considered a special discounted rate! I'm honestly not sure how anyone can afford to live in this area.
I hope they are not still going to mandate that first year students live on campus dorms. That's how it worked at Chapel Hill and may even be longer at other schools. The system is going to suffer because they have built a bunch of dorms without thinking it was possible for them to be empty, but tough shit CoVid has wrecked pretty much everything.    I certainly got out of the dorms as soon as I could at UNC Chapel Hill. If you were curious, the pricing for a shared room is about $860/month. And that's for 200 square feet shared with another person, likely a stranger if you don't have a lot of friends going to UNC, and a bathroom down the hall shared with about 20 other strangers.   Compare that to the market rate in chapel hill for a 2 bedroom apartment, where you get your own room, your own bathroom, a kitchen, and a living room can be found for $1200 or less.   Now certainly there are benefits to living in dorms at first, it is a great way to meet new people and I am glad I did it, but they really need to lower the price to be more competitive.
Just to add something else completely fucked up, we have to make this decision to stay or leave by July 11, or we’ll be charged a fee.
How is this legal? Even though this is in a contract, it can still definitely be challenged(especially since living on campus, for freshmen whose parents don't live in town, is compulsory) in court.  The fuck is going on with the UNC system lately? They have been getting particularly scummy in recent years.  Edit: specified it's just for freshmen
Ugh. UNC should be like any other landlord when they kick everyone off campus, and be made to not collect rent while no one is allowed in their room.
60 Minutes interviewed the Chancellor and they got him to basically admit this was a funding pull.  They're fully anticipating a potential return to 100% remote work partway through the semester.  But now they have concocted a plan to have students bring in money, keep the money, then send them home again.
Well that's fucking criminal. Gonna be a lot of empty dorms in the year ahead.
Couple different things going on here. Firstly, there are a range of different services that appear to be implicated in addition to physically housing students. The University may cut back on one or more of those in its discretion, and isn't responsible to award a credit. In some cases, that's probably not that bad.   Also note that the provision indicates the University has no obligation to award a credit. What it doesn't say is the University "shall not" award a credit. Students may end up getting credited if they're totally prevented from access to housing they paid for. If that is the case, it may be in the University's interest to simply award a credit rather than endure the legal and political onslaught that will inevitably occur if parent NC taxpayers are so slighted.  But ultimately, this is a common lawyer trick that probably won't work in its most egregious application (i.e. total forfeiture after closure of housing). It's unlikely UNC could enforce this clause in such a way. But as a lawyer, you put this in as a blanket means to scaring away plaintiffs and setting up a defense for a range of different claims.
when people say government should be run like a business this is what you get
I gave everything to UNC     And I feel kind of free     Take everything away from me     And I feel kind of free!
Wow, I would definitely not sign, if I were them. No refund, if the school forces them off campus, due to COVID??? Thats criminal.
I do not think they can unilateral change any agreements already signed. Though maybe not many have been during the summer.  But IANAL, so someone else who IAL will need to chime in.
Where was this found? I can't find the source of this info.
Students need to start protesting and let UNC systems know what is up.
So... I imagined students did not get a partial refund for tuition either
Well, I'm no lawyer, but I see they have wrote "Contact" and not "Contract" so that might be exploited in a student's favor somehow?
We got our kids off-campus housing for the next 2 semesters. It's cheaper anyway.
Wish I stayed in the UK. The university system here is absolutely insane.
I've heard of parents renting a house near campus so that freshmen could have the off-campus exception, but I'm not sure that's legit.
lol  college is a scam. It sucks cause if you don't go, yuo lose out. If you do go, you're getting screwed by a corrupt system.  I think Hasan did an episode on how fucked the college system is on Patriot Act.
Actually, I don't acknowledge that.
How thoughtful of them
So why don't people get together and do a class action lawsuit?
This is petty. But everything is just annoying right now.  Like You can use the neighborhood pool 2 hours a week; but you still have to pay for all hours of neighborhood pool.
They didn't give anyone the discount for the difference in tuition for physical to online classes either a d if you had a parking pass you paid like 400 dollars at UNCG and didn't get a dime back for not using it for 6 months. .  I have a lot of fries with UNCG about their policies, but they have handled a lot of this Covid pandemic with greedy hands.
Sounds like they're making it easy to decide to take a year off.
Aaaaand this is why I’m cancelling my housing contract and moving off campus. They can kiss my ass.
This is genuinely horrible and obviously taking advantage of students, but the good news is that this doesn’t apply to every UNC school. The Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs at App State was contacted by email and he said that this was specifically a UNCG policy that did not apply to App and “We are not planning on making any changes to our housing contract.” It sounds like it came down from the UNC board as a recommendation for all schools though, so it’s anyone’s guess which ones will adopt the policy.
Don't forget your PPE safety kit!  https://www.ocm.com/nch/product/ppe-safety-kit-for-college-2147971394
Really happy I graduated from UNCW last year, before this pandemic began...if I were still a current student about to live on campus in the upcoming school year I’d transfer...
so who do we blame.....republicans...democrats....all of them????
Everyone take a breath.    The language of a contract must be considered in context.  You'll notice that the quoted paragraph is subsection (d) of a Section 18 "Termination."  You have not been given subsections (a) - (c) or anything following this subsection (d).  With this information missing we can only guess, but this paragraph appears expressly limited to TEMPORARY closures, "restrictions" and "adjustments."  This then implies that some other section provides for a different treatment in the event that campuses are closed as they were for this prior school year.  Edit:  First time anyone has been downvoted for providing a take on canons of interpretation.  I love reddit.
I believe they require freshmen to stay on campus their first year.
This is affecting off campus housing through the school as well. This was put on my daughter's portal for school today.
I doubt most college town leases have an out clause either. Most are for 12 months.
This is America.
Disgusting,  We need wholesale change of the UNC Board. Bunch of grifters.
they are likely to be locked in their dorms ("pods" they call them) doing Zoom University because faculty and support staff will be staying home.
Just about everybody should go to CC for the first year, anyways.  Take a variety of classes to figure out what your major should be, knock out easy elective credits like Bowling, etc.
they all read this sub ;-)
I mean Chapel Hill is an expensive place to live for NC, but there are definitely affordable options depending on location and how nice you want it to be. There are not-so-nice two bedroom apartments in Carrboro for under $1000 a month and pretty decent but older two bedroom apartments for $1100-1300. You could check out Carrboro or Durham if you need cheaper options than Chapel Hill proper! :)
Yeah I work at UNC and I can’t afford to move out of my parents house right now because Chapel Hill/ surrounding area is just too damn expensive to live in.
If it makes you feel better, i live in Nashville now and pay 2 grand a month not including utilities to be 25 minutes from vandy's campus
The Board of Governors is what has happened. Check out who's been appointed over the last few years
Anything involving money in the state of NC is scummy
What about for the people who already signed their contracts for next year? It sounds like they are going to change it and take our cancelation fee if we dont sign the new one.
Got a link? Would love to see
This is what happens when government is not run like a business. The government doesn't follow the same rules as private business. It would be illegal for a landlord to do something like this.
NC lawyer. Generally, you're right. However parties can agree to allow one or the other to make unilateral modifications to contracts. Not all of those modifications are likely enforceable, and with too much discretion to modify, you potentially get into what's called illusory contracts (which are unenforceable). I'd need to see the whole contract to get a sense if this one might be, but one can avoid the general principle of mutual written modification via prior agreement.  Also, insofar as this applies to future periods where housing services will be provided not already under contract, it's basically a whole new agreement and not a modification.
They can only do that when get here, and they can only get here if they sign these ridiculous contracts.   With the exception of course of the football team, who I noticed were working out the wide receiver corps at Navy field yesterday. So that's all about priorities
They finished classes. Got credit. So no.
All of them.
When they closed campus last semester that was considered a temporary closure.
I could totally be wrong, but even if they closed for four semesters in a row it would still be considered a temporary closing, because there are plans on opening back up. When they all closed down this past semester it was a temporary closing, even though it ran all the way through the end of the semester and through summer
They do.
Believe this may be based on the school. Never lived on campus at UNCC and came in as a traditional freshman at 18 yo.
And this year, they don't seem to be communicating the fact that these freshmen are mostly going to be attending Zoom University from their dorm room...cos faculty is staying home.
I stayed home my freshman year and commuted just fine. No requirement at UNC Charlotte
True in general, but there are exceptions. UNCA (when I attended, at least) would waive the requirement to reside on campus if you could demonstrate that doing so would present an economic hardship; that's how I got out of it.
For the last semester (I don't think they did), but did they offer any housing refunds?
Off campus housing is just apartments. How are they gonna close apartments?
Getting out of the lease isn’t the problem. It’s getting kicked out of your home and still being required to continue paying for it until the end of the lease.
My brother in another state had his lease create a month to month option in case classes went online and people decided to move back home.
Every time I read something like this, I quietly say "this is America" to myself and think of Childish Gambino. At least the song makes me happy.
From my understanding UNC is making a lot of the support staff come in. Staff at UNC have very little rights unless they fit under some sort of health exceptions, and this includes office workers. UNC appears to be doing a top down approach where the decision was made for us to return back in the Fall and everyone, including faculty and stuff are affected because UNC wants our tuition money.
Literally got my associates and most of my undergrad done in CC, then got to the UNC system and realized they have mandated credit hours so you can't actually do that anymore, ending up I'll graduate with extra credits.   Also that foreign language policy is rediculous. 4 classes? Most schools do 2.
Shit.
Yeah that was the first thing I assumed. With McCrory and the supermajority Republicans, they've been actively disrupting the UNC system. I would think there's more I didn't know about.
https://www.cbsnews.com/news/colleges-reopen-fall-students-coronavirus-pandemic-60-minutes-2020-06-14/  My opinion started after the word "pull."
lol
landlords can literally do whatever they want
Lol you don’t know anything about being a landlord
We received an email today with instructions for submitting questions students may have for the chancellor.  My response concerned this particular clause. Hopefully many other students will ask the same question, and hopefully Chancellor Woodson will respond to such a query. There will some kind of teleconference soon, can’t remember the date.
i agree, i am so tired of every company, industry, government, everything just passing the costs (real and imaginary) to the people who just cant afford it. goes with this and health insurance, everyone "protecting" their industry on the backs of the common people....people who work hard and save to try and send their kids to college...can the college stop COVID, no....but why does everything get passed down to the ones that are already struggling
As a legal matter, it was certainly a permanent closure as to the term of an annual housing agreement (i.e. the term expired before there was a re-opening).
Likely not, as "permanent" v "temporary" would reasonably only be considered within the term of the housing agreement, which is presumably at most only one school year.  Again, we do not have the agreement.  We have a paragraph.  No lawyer, judge, or redditor can confidently conclude what this paragraph means.
I got out of this my freshman year by going to a psychologist, giving them a sob story about how I couldn’t do dorms anymore, and for mental health reasons they allowed me to move off campus. This is an option, granted a few more steps. (I went to boarding school and that would have been my 4th year in a dorm by 18, I was fucking over it.)
Is there an option to stay home within a certain distance?  This rule should be dropped during covid.
Since when?  That was definitely not a rule in 08 when I was a freshman.
This is not true. I called the other day and verified with housing after my rising freshman niece told me this.
We did get a partial refund for housing during the spring semester.
Very true!
Support staff reporting for duty.. that's an affirmative.
I work campus dining and am really wondering how badly we're going to be affected by all of this. When we shut down for summer (well, not completely, but you don't really need all that many people to sling quick-fix items for the ~50 or so people still stuck on campus), it seemed like higher ups thought everything would be all systems go come August.
Yeah, I ended up having to retake a bunch of stuff at university in TN even after 3 years of mostly 15-18hr semesters at a state college in GA (was fairly close to 3 different associates but just picked one to graduate and move on)  Ended up graduating with over 200-something hours for my Bachelors lol.  But it was fun ruining that Freshman-level world lit class in my last year for all of the 19 year olds when I'd get the professor into long back and forth discussions about shit I'd covered once or twice in different courses already.
You have to be careful these days too because if you take too many total credits you can get charged extra. This hits hard for people who change majors and end up going over the limit.
So could the universities theoretically close housing for half the semester, "reopen" it for a couple of days at the very end of the semester, and not be obligated to refund students for the weeks they had no place to stay?
If there is acceptable place to upload the entire addendum I can do so during lunch.
Here is a link to Western Carolina's Residential Living Agreement until I can get the Addendum from UNCG uploaded.  https://www.wcu.edu/operations-procedures/residential-living-agreement.aspx  > Residents acknowledge that, in the event of such temporary closures, restrictions, and/or adjustments to the housing services schedule, WCU shall not have the obligation to issue a partial refund or credit for such interruptions or adjustments. In the event WCU requires resident to vacate university housing, resident will be responsible for removing all valuable personal items at that time.
Yea. Every school has a distance exception so long as they are staying with their legal guardian. Which is an odd exception to exclude other family.   I’m a UNCW grad, so [here is theirs for example](https://uncw.edu/housing/prospective_students/freshmen-on-campus-housing-requirement.html).
The rule should be dropped full stop. There's no reason to require dorm living other than to get more money from students.
Since a few years ago
It wasn’t when I was in college either. But it is now.
When I started ECU in 2014, freshman had to live in dorms unless they lived within 35 miles of the school.
My sister was a freshman in 2011 and it was required
It is true. There are exceptions but it is required of all freshmen who just graduated high school.
Those refunds came from the Federal government btw, the Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund  God forbid the UNC system have to take care of its own students- administrators need their $500K salaries!   [https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ope/caresact.html](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ope/caresact.html)
They could try that but all contracts require at minimum "good faith."  That sounds pretty dicey and could open the University to broad claims (from lots of plaintiffs) about the University having engaged in unfair and deceptive trade practices.  (The University would then try to defend on immunity.)
Another thought for any future fight over this provision:  In addition to having all the context, there is a principle of contract interpretation that all the words matter.  As such the word "temporary" has to be doing some work in this paragraph.  It would seem likely that the word distinguishes the closures from "permanent" ones.    Edit:  I would be as concerned regarding the following section of this webpage that claims to absolve the University from damage to the resident's property and provides not standard of care for that property.
> their legal guardian  Which nobody 18+ is going to have since they're an adult.
That’s exactly why they do it. It’s the same reason State is pushing profs for in person classes. They want money and that’s it.
'Studies' have shown that 4 year graduation rates are higher for students who have to live on campus their first year.
I remember the explanation being that students who live off campus (rather than on campus or nearby with family) have a harder time completing their degree or getting good grades.  So rather than looking at WHY, they just found this minor connection and said, this works! I’ve known plenty who have made it work, and plenty living at home/on campus that have still had bad grades or dropped.
35 miles holy shit
When I called the guy laughed and said no.
Just asked again. He said “where are you reading this? Reddit doesn’t count as a reputable source.” He also said the “exceptions” thing isn’t a thing. It’s literally not a rule, so having exceptions to a nonexistent rule is silly.  Housing and Residence Life is operating regular business hours from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday through Friday. 704-687-7501
It is a weird rule. They clearly mean their legal guardian before the student became an adult but I raised an eyebrow at that sentence, too. It’s worded poorly.
sorta, but most kids are still dependents when they go to school (on their parent’s health insurance, live at home over the summers, have help paying for school from their parents.) so while the term “guardian” is a bit misleading, they clearly mean the person or people who take care of the student
loophole : aren't they their own legal guardian?
It me. I am my guardian.
LOL. I got a chuckle out of those apostrophes
Then he was wrong. All schools in the UNC school system have this requirement with some exceptions. Most common being that the student lives within a certain distance of the school.
Which school is this?  If it is not in the UNC school system then that is why.  E: Apparently UNCC does not say one way or another on their website. If that is what the man says then go by what he says. NC State, UNC, UNCW, UNCP, WCU, and App State all require it I know.
> All schools in the UNC school system have this requirement with some exceptions.  UNCC does not require freshmen to live on campus.
UNC Charlotte does not have a freshman mandate to live on campus. I think only 75% of UNCG freshman live on campus (and they word it as freshmen making that choice)
UNC Charlotte
Looks like they’re the only two schools in the UNC system that don’t.
I’m pretty sure you’re right about that
I’m honestly surprised. I was under the impression it was the whole UNC school system. But they’re the two holdouts.

N.C. reports record-high hospitalizations, 840+ new COVID-19 cases. It’s nice to know Coopers Lock Down Helped the State . On a side note this could be contributed to the people protesting . Get this guy out of Office Come November. .

Removed: rule 3  This is your [second](https://www.reddit.com/r/NorthCarolina/comments/gxmejz/george_floyd_is_not_the_kind_of_person_you_fly/) rule violation.  Please be more mindful of our rules in the future.
Your ridiculous post has inspired me to donate to his campaign which I didnt plan on doing.  Folks like you are going to force me to start phone banking for him too.     https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/roycooper?express_lane=true&amount=50&refcode=website-popup
Cases are surging because the "lockdown" has been eased significantly. These surges are a result of things opening up and people not social distancing or wearing masks. The lockdown did help, but, nobody wants to do it anymore.
There's been no outbreaks connected to either the ReOpen or Floyd protesters though.  Minnesota had *bigger* protests than we did, and they're doing much better than us:  https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusMN/comments/hd9ztl/621_update_32920_positives_453_1380_deaths_8/  >It is absolutely amazing that there has been not even a blip from the protests. It looks like we might be able to get the LTC deaths under control, and then just wait for the second wave.
We probably wouldn’t be having this conversation if Trump hadn’t called it a hoax, nothing to worry about, one day it will be gone, poof!  Between this an his golfing habit the US did nothing in January and February and then he pushed everything out to the states.  We’re lucky we have a pragmatic and level headed Governor who takes his responsibilities to NC citizens seriously.
Ahh the truth is a rule violation ?
I’m glad I could help . Fact: infections are increasing not decreasing . I don’t comprehend how the left can not comprehend that .
Possibly however if cases continue to rise and it appears that  the lock down was a complete waste of time and money .
Jonestown was flavor-aid, don't disparage the good name of the Kool-aid man.
If you are saying 50,000 plus people being effected is a result of Coopers amazing Governor skills I truly don’t see your point. However by all means vote for him in November I assure you I will Not .
What a dense thing to say. The lock down slowed our growth and kept it from growing exponentially. It also gave hospitals time to put in systems and checks to help handle a large increase in hospital visits. Had the lockdown not occured they could have been overrun. The lockdown absolutely slowed down the spread. Moving us to phase 2 so quickly is where things went wrong. You should really take a good look at yourself and your backwards logic. I truly hope no one you are close with contracts it, but your shit sentiments leave me with doubt.
I couldn’t care less who you vote for. The reason Cooper got dragged into the clusterf*ck is your Great Leader did nothing for two months and we are paying dearly for that.   Obama literally left a pandemic playbook but of course Great Leader had that destroyed. There was also a pandemic response team that was part of the National Security Council but for some unfathomable reason,  that’s not around anymore.    Had your Great Leader kept these resources then action could have started in January instead of mid March. You know how late that was? The first case in the US didn’t even have the Wuhan Corona strain. Our first case came from Italy so it had already mutated and still it was weeks later before Great Leader stopped calling it a hoax.
Blah Blah by all means live on the plantation it seems you’re a custom to it and unfortunately have accepted it as normal. Trump did more in 4 years than the reject Obama did in 8
Snort
Oh ugh, the karma farmer is following me around with his filthy (and repetitive) ‘insults’.   Know what else is pathetic? Removing that person’s post in r/Democrats after they mentioned what was in your profile. Looks to me like he hit a nerve.   Sooo, this is how you treat fellow Democrats? A poser would do this, but not someone committed to Democratic leadership in 2020.    As always, thanks in advance for the downvote.

Some numerical context for the statewide Covid-19 testing/cases.
My wife and I live outside of Detroit currently, and are moving back to North Carolina (outside of Charlotte) this week. We went through the initial spike of cases here in Michigan watching the UM Healthcare network starting to buckle, the erection of field hospitals, the conversion of physical therapy and general practice offices in our small town to more beds for patients, and the initial stay at home order that went into effect March 24th. I've obviously been keeping an eye on North Carolina numbers lately since we're about to move, but also because we still have friends and family in the state.North Carolina is closing in on daily new cases close to what Michigan hit at our peak, about 12 days after the stay at home order. On April 3rd, Michigan had ~1900 new cases, with a %positive test rate of ~30%, which means about 6300 total tests for the day. This was about 12 days after the stay at home order, which pretty well lines up with the incubation period. After that, there was a slow but noticeable decline in the daily positive and %positive as testing ramped up. May 14th shows a spike, but its due to finally processing a testing backlog and adding it to the total tracker. Whitmer has kept large parts of the stay at home in place, relaxing it selectively in parts of the state that show a low rate of spread like the upper penninsula.Now, North Carolina. We've had 2 ~1700 days in the last week. Yes, that is on a testing rate of about 16000 a day which can definitely attribute to a higher total number. The problem is that there has been no action to *decrease* spread, and any actions that are taken aren't reflected in the data for nearly two weeks.Currently a little more than 55,000 North Carolinians have tested positive for Coronavirus, and the lion's share of those have occurred in the last month and a half, when testing has been a fair bit more comprehensive. About **.6% of the population of North Carolina** has had Covid-19. There are two ways to look at this number.1. Hardly anyone has gotten it, why should we shut everything down if basically no one is sick?2. Almost no one has immunity to this, and it is *very* contagious, why haven't we started shutting everything down again?As more people become sick it means there are more opportunities for the virus to spread. This is what exponential growth means. In Michigan, we've had a low number of new daily cases for about a month, around 200/day. Up until a week ago, we were at a level of shut down that was more conservative than North Carolina: Barbershops were closed, retail was limited, gyms and bars are closed, restaurants weren't doing dine in, etc. In the last week, more of these things have started to open, and the Republicans in the legislature are trying to force others to open, but Whitmer has been very conservative in opening the state because of the delay between implementation and new cases.For the next two weeks, North Carolina is going to see growth faster than Michigan saw, which prompted us to stay at home for more than 3 months. If the government does nothing to slow the spread in those two weeks, we will just continue to see higher and higher daily totals right up until the day schools start. This is why Fauci testified today that the next two weeks are absolutely critical to containment of the virus.Starting at age 18, for every 100 people infected at least 2 will require hospitalization. As the age of the infected goes up the rate goes up as well, to as high as 20% for 75+. As far as I'm aware, the demographic breakdown of those testing positive isn't available publicly, but we can pretty reasonably predict the average rate of hospitalization and when it will occur. This means, for each of those ~1700 new case days, on average more than 42 will require hospitalization in about 11 days. At the point where the state is already at 80% ICU utilization.It is unsustainable. Please call, write, or email your representatives, senators, and the governor. They have all of this data and more. They are seeing the trend line move upwards and dragging their feet. Today UNC made the reason plain as day. They changed their housing policy to not allow refunds for housing if the school closes for coronavirus, even though they're requiring students to live on campus for classes. The math isn't complicated, and there have been a lot of great efforts to make the information more digestible. Please, go find the peer-reviewed data on hospitalization, infection timetable, and everything else and check it for yourself.
This is the sad reality. And in the moment, as I’m sure you’re aware, we can’t even get people to *choose* to wear masks because it hasn’t hit close enough to home... yet. Humans being selfish isn’t a new thing, but seeing it like this is something I couldn’t have wrapped my brain around just a few months ago.
This is a top down failure beginning with Trump. Yes, that is exactly where the initial blame lies. The fact that there *still is no comprehensive federal plan* to deal with the pandemic screams volumes about his criminal neglect of this.  I could go on for quite a while.  Bottom line is it is going to get much, much, worse.  Not enough are taking this seriously.  *Don't think it won't happen just because it hasn't happened yet* -  Jackson Browne  Quedate en casa.
This whole thing has been a disaster. Like bad parenting of teens.   “This is what’s expected of you; there will be consequences if don’t do what is expected.”  Then the teenager throws a fit to get what they want & the parent is just disappointed but no real consequences.
Most of us on here are not experts, and even the experts don't agree on everything.  So, everything is subjective and anecdotal at best.  This is just my take.  So, you just might be right, but there are other things to consider...  Michigan experienced issues very early in the game.  There was little social distancing, masks were hard to come by, we were still learning much about the disease as elderly were more exposed and businesses hadn't properly prepared.  What does this mean for North Carolina?  The businesses here have adjusted to accommodate social distancing and disinfecting.  Testing is more widely available.  We understand much more about the disease and how it spreads.  The people getting the disease is trending to a younger demographic.  People ARE wearing masks.  Certainly not everyone and not in every situation.  But, to read some of these posts, you would think nobody is social distancing or wearing a mask, which is simply not true.  There are people that just don't care, but most people I see and most places I go, there is a fair amount of effort to minimize the spread while finding a balance of being locked down.  I do see some ignorance out there, for sure, but it is limited.  North Carolina population tends to be more spread out than Michigan as well.   Bigger cities have been hit harder than rural areas.  We might experience pockets of outbreaks, but shouldn't be subject to the larger scale outbreaks like Detroit and other large metro areas have had.  North Carolina has a very good medical system.  There are some very good medical schools, hospitals, research companies and doctors here.  As you noted, your peak cases was with 30% positive, while NC has been hovering just below 10%.  Also, by some estimates, due to the serological testing that has been done, as many as 50x or more the people have been infected than the confirmed cases. You can't just go by the number of only 55k being infected.  Which means that many people have little or no symptoms.  And, younger people are less impacted.  I've also heard multiple reports that some of the experts suspect that due to seeing overall less severe symptoms that the virus has mutated to be less potent.  Anecdotal at best, but that is the impression of some doctors.  In the end, it doesn't really make sense to overlay the Michigan template on North Carolina due to different time frames and other factors.  I suspect that NC has a system that will bend and be tested, but not break.  But, again, nobody knows for sure and only time will tell.  The best advice for everyone is to be safe, take care of the vulnerable and do what makes the most sense for you and the ones close to you.  EDIT: changed typo "can" --> "can't", for proper meaning and context
This is the first scientific study I've ever read that concluded with "the math isn't complicated" followed by "go find the data".
All right, I’d provide data showing why several of your assertions are dead wrong, studies showing predominant asymptomatic cases, etc, but I have a feeling you aren’t actually interested in data. So let me leave you with this:   Locking down doesn’t make the issue go away, it just delays it. There is no magic bullet cure or vaccine coming. Even if today’s vaccine candidates work out (big If, we have one vaccine showing efficacy issues and another based on completely untested technology), you’ll be looking at 2 years for any kind of meaningful distribution. After two months of lockdown, this country was burning with looters in the streets. After 6 months, there won’t be a country to reopen. Realistically, a methodical reopening that recognizes that some people will unavoidably die and instead aims to prevent avoidable death by keeping hospitals from being overrun is our only option. This is the real world, people die. Pandemics occasionally pop up and kill a whole bunch of them. We still don’t have the technology to prevent that and pretending otherwise is just denial. Time for you to start moving to the other stages of grief.
I'm actually tired of these fake numbers being spread as "percentages" without the REAL NUMBERS.  And the reality is, most of this is opinion and numbers being used without denominators.  80% ICU Utilization has been thrown around way too much and seems more like a freak out talking point, when hospitals in reality are begging people to come in. Healthcare employees are having benefits taken away because of this revenue shortfall.  How many ICU patients are at Duke, UNC, Rex, WakeMed, Novant, Vidant, etc, including rural systems that are in for only COVID? Give the actual number.  Also, include how many ICU beds are at each location.  Bed populations are closely monitored by each health system because that's how they keep their revenue stream high by running at 100% capacity. I know because i've seen these reports, X beds occupied, X waiting for discharge, X waiting for admission.  I'm just having problems listening to someone talking about numerical context when they can't even do simple math.   2019 , population of North Carolina 10.5 Million (probably more, but we will know after 2020 Census).  55,000 divided by 10,500,000 equals 0.005238 , which in a percentage is .005% not .6%   So how about be accurate about your statements and perhaps folks won't think you have some sort of propoganda agenda.   If you feel vulnerable wear a mask, you will be able to protect yourself.  100% of caretakers who wore proper protection equipment and was with direct contact with a COVID19 patient for 15 minutes or less contract the disease. THAT MEANS ZERO people contracted the disease with proper masking, etc.  You wrap it up by saying math isn't complicated and you are right, it's not.. see the above math equation, I did it twice on a calculator just to make sure I wasn't incorrect. Did you just copy paste out of your talking points handbook, who sent it to you is what I'd like to know... get to the source of the group of folks spreading misinformation intentionally. Because that is exactly what you are doing in your long winded misinformation post.
Selfishness does not explain the amount of overweight 60 year olds I have witnessed bitching about wearing a mask. I suspect ideological tantrum-throwing is a more common occurrence. I also suspect if Trump did some mask-wearing photo ops these same people would be wearing maga masks.
Ooookay, going to take these one at a time.  >Michigan experienced issues very early in the game  Yes, and we still implemented a stay at home order that drastically reduced the infection rate. North Carolina hasn't done that. They put in place an order prior to the virus being prevalent enough for community spread, then started lifting it too fast, ignoring outbreaks in meat packing plants, and hasn't build anywhere near an adequate enough tracing program. To top it off, the state clearly hasn't used its two month head start to build adequate ICU capacity since we're already at 80% capacity.  >NC businesses have adjusted  It is, simply put, not possible to implement the controls needed to prevent infection in places like gyms or bowling alleys. Even at 50% capacity, bars and restaurants can't adequately prevent infection spread with indoor dining. Retail stores not requiring masks is idiotic, and will result in more infections. None of the 3 plans the governor has put forward for schools can prevent widespread infection.  >Trending younger  Even assuming every new case is 18, it will put hospitals at ICU capacity. This is *especially* bad for rural communities that have next to no medical infrastructure. A look at the Navajo Nation can show how dire a situation spread in a rural community is. Further, young peoples higher rate of asymptomatic carrying increases the ability of the virus to spread, and it will spread to those that are more vulnerable.   Also, there are plenty of good schools in Michigan too. Damn near every faculty member, postdoc, and grad student I know is insanely worried about the fact that administrators at these schools are making the decisions based around finances, not public health. My wife got het PhD from UNC Chapel Hill, and did research in the med school at U of M. She's been in on calls from universities around the nation; they're all concerned but they're not the ones driving the discussions.   >Serological testing  There is no methodologically sound research showing anywhere near 50x the exposure as positive tests show. Most that have at least tried to have sounds methods have shown as high as 10x, and those studies were still flawed by sample bias. A confounding factor is that serologic testing still isn't accurate enough. The low number of infections means about half of positives are false positives, showing antibodies from other more common coronaviruses (4 common strains of the "cold" are coronaviruses) as positive for covid-19 antibodies.  Even if there were some reliable data saying 50x as many people have been infected, it would still be less than 15% of the population of North Carolina, well below the expected 75%+ needed to reach a state of herd immunity. And still enough to overwhelm hospitals as it spreads.
The statistics show we are growing at slightly lower than an exponential rate in terms of positives, and while the percent positive is staying flat it merely means more of the population is infected than we know.  Statistics also show a very large group of asymptomatic cases.  Statistics also show a fatality rate of 1.3 out of every 100 who have the disease and 4.6 per 100,000.  With the number of ICU beds available, major North Carolina regions could be out of bed space by July with rural counties at capacity in the next two weeks.
Great comment. **Healthy** skepticism, especially of new, previously untested theories and models, is a fundamental characteristic of good science. There is a vast chasm between skepticism of something like the theory of evolution, which has been probed and amended and improved upon for over a century, and scientific theories on epidemiological modeling of a novel virus that's been studied for seven months. The amount of people who equate **healthy** skepticism of brand new science to utter "science denial" is frankly disturbing. Everyone SHOULD have a healthy skepticism of **new** studies especially if they confirm any biases you might have, that's literally why peer review exists and why scientists revisit theories and studies for years and years.   That said, I'd like to respectfully make one contention with one part of your comment:  >So, everything is subjective and anecdotal at best  Even models and theories that turn out to be inaccurate can still be objective and based on current *good science*. The only time science isn't good or objective is when it refuses to accommodate new information. So I would not say that even inaccurate modeling is "subjective" rather that it can be quite objective just lacking the ability to consider variables that are totally unknown....  That small gripe aside, your mention of serological testing is exactly why healthy skepticism is important. Once data about serological testing became available, the IFR for covid-19 became much lower than previously thought and how it spread had to be re-imagined, especially among different age groups. On top of that, a very recent study detecting T-cell activation in people with verified exposure who **developed no antibodies** MIGHT add another huge variable to consider regarding spread and non-pharmaceutical prevention.   Another fairly recent study I recall seeing is that it only takes about half the population wearing masks to lower Rt enough that spread declines. Full disclosure before I get a bunch of hate mail and downvotes (though I'm learning there may be no way to avoid that in this forum), I am not an anti-masker, I'm an anti-anti-masker and I actually think mandated masks are a good idea.   On top of all that, the economic ramifications are being **dramatically** understated, especially given the one-two punch of mass protests and rioting during a global pandemic. Is "getting a haircut" more important than killing granny? Definitely not. But thousands of businesses going under and widening economic disparities from constant knee-jerk policies based on extremely new science should make everyone skeptical to some extent. I don't want to kill everyone's granny but I also don't want to end up working for Costco next year based on premature modeling because Costco is the only employer left.   Most importantly I've had like 4 DIPAs so I reserve the right to amend or append any and all of these statements in the morning.
1. This isn't a scientific study  2. Damn near every scientific study worth a damn has methods and citation sections *specifically meant* for doing the math yourself and verifying the data yourself.
Just going to address the only thing worth addressing again here.  My wearing a mask will decrease (not erase) my likelihood of getting covid-19, yes. However, my chance of illness is not the only problem. People choosing not to wear masks and governments ignoring the impact of virus are going to kill many more people in the long term. I have about 5 friends or family members going through cancer treatments currently. Luckily they've been in areas that weren't heavily impacted in the initial spike, but that's starting to change. On top of that, as utilization grows it means there are less or no beds for those everyday illnesses and injuries that require hospitalization or surgery.   This virus isn't only infecting people that care about it. Other people not wearing masks affects me as well as you.
The percentage version of .005 is .5%
You are busy kind of nit picking everything and completely missed my point.  The bottom line is that everything with this has been moving very fast and things change every day.  Depending on where you look, you will find different thoughts and anecdotal evidence.  Anyone can come up with information to support their narrative.  So, my overall point was that even the experts disagree on much and they still don't know everything they need to know.  They are still in a big learning curve themselves.  All us armchair quarterbacks are just trying to figure out things ourselves.  I was trying to illustrate why you cannot just take what you know from Michigan and apply it to NC.  Some of your arguments may be correct or not.  I'm not going to get hung up on actual stats and opinions because there is way too much context left out of the data for the layperson to make deep sense of it.  They help, and you need to make some educated decisions off them, but understanding that you don't get to see the full picture and context is important.  For example, we have no idea how many of the hospitalized in NC are in ICU.  Without us knowing what % of hospitalizations go to ICU, and how long they stay there, how is the layperson supposed to make any assumptions when our ICU beds will be full?  You would also need additional understanding of this broken down by age group.  Meaning comments like *"Even assuming every new case is 18, it will put hospitals at ICU capacity."* are possibly not true, because we just don't know the extent of the hospitalizations.  And, what you see in Michigan may not be what you see in NC.  If nothing else, just look at the recorded death rates for known cases - 8.96% for Michigan to 2.37% in North Carolina.  Things are different which is pretty much the point of my response.  EDIT: and worth noting that we cannot prevent the infection.  The idea was never to prevent the infection, but to minimize the spread.  Flatten the curve and protect the vulnerable as much as possible is the goal.
Please document and source your statements, 1.3 out of every 100 is the fatality rate, you must have forgot some zeros.  Let's keep this to North Carolina.  According to the CDC, North Carolina currently has 1223 Deaths.  According to the CDC, North Carolina currently has 53605 Reported Positive Cases.  Please help me with the math you did to get 1.3 out of every 100 is the fatality rate, because you are wrong. So, where-ever you are getting your Statistics from, you need a new book.
This is an opinion. There is no factual basis for your statement. You are entitled to your opinion. You are protecting yourself by wearing a mask, as should your 5 friends or family.  Accusing people of murder for not wearing a mask is IN-SANE.
And you're missing my point. The medical community isn't actually conflicted on the points that matter right now. We've seen millions of cases of this disease in medical hospitals attached to research institutions. We know the predominant progression and we've had enough cases to have statistically sound understandings of how many will get sick. The "disagreement" you're seeing is from fringe groups akin to climate change deniers.  Also, notice that I haven't mentioned death rate between the two states. Deaths follow infection by about another week. On top of that, %deaths has varied so much because of inadequate testing in the early stages of spread and different states choosing to declare death differently in order to reduce the reported numbers.  On the ICU capacity, we again know the statistical likelihood of patients being hospitalized and requiring ICU care. We also know those who end up in the ICU/on a vent are there for a week or more.  None of what I'm saying is directly applying "Michigan to North Carolina" other than the fact that North Carolina is about to hit case numbers worse than Michigan.
https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/full/10.1377/hlthaff.2020.00455?utm_campaign=covid19fasttrack&utm_medium=press&utm_content=basu&utm_source=mediaadvisory  The difficulty is ascertaining the number of asymptomatic people.  If that number is much larger than is being reported, then the IFR is probably closer to 1%.
Yea, no, none of that is opinion. All of it is fact.  Also, don't see where I accused anyone of murder. Just negligence for the well-being of your fellow people.
> None of what I'm saying is directly applying "Michigan to North Carolina" other than the fact that North Carolina is about to hit case numbers worse than Michigan.  And, you somehow have extrapolated that to the hospitals being overwhelmed.  That may prove to be true.  But, this is not an argument that can be had with the publicly available data.  If we had the raw data to look at, it might be a different discussion.  Which was why I've mentioned context.  I would love to get my hands on the raw data, but I suspect it isn't available due to HIPAA concerns.   >On the ICU capacity, we again know the statistical likelihood of patients being hospitalized and requiring ICU care. We also know those who end up in the ICU/on a vent are there for a week or more.  Do you have a source for this?  I haven't been able to find it in public data.  Also, do keep in mind with the age of infection trending lower, this stat is likely lowering as well.   >The "disagreement" you're seeing is from fringe groups akin to climate change deniers.  Yeah... No.  Certainly, there are those.  Same as people that jerk the wheel too hard the other way.  Extreme always happens on both sides with any issue.  On balance, I think people are just trying to figure it out with a lack of any real absolutes available.  This is where the disagreements are coming from.     >The medical community isn't actually conflicted on the points that matter right now.   Perhaps you'd like to share what the consensus of the NC medical community is for relevant data points, and what your qualifications are to determine that.  I will be the first to tell you what I think will happen is simply my opinion.  Anyone saying they know how this will play out is either just flat out wrong or they have a ton more data than what is publicly available.
Thank you for being transparent and sharing your information. I read this. The formula to determine Infection Fatality Rate (IFR) was how I was doing math in which I stand by my statements.  Per this document, IFR is determined by the deaths of confirmed cases. The Death's being the numerator, and the confirmed cases being the denominator.  So, i'd like someone to help me, because either they think that no one is doing math to check them, or maybe I have a bad calculator.  Deaths over Reported Positive Cases.  They used the flu for an example:  34,200 deaths for 35,500,000 reported positive cases. They state that this is a 0.1% infection fatality rate. When I put 34,200 divided by 35,500,000 into a calculator I get 0.00096%, are they rounding? I am using THEIR formula and THEIR numbers and get a completely different result. Is my calculator bad? (I did the old fashion multiple the result and I got the 34,200 again.) So I don't think the calculator is bad.  So, I know banks have bank calculators to make lots of money. Is there a special health calculator that report numbers to make the situation seem more dire than it is?  I'd like to note, that this Health Affairs organization is funded by an NGO - Project Hope and a consulting company Salutis Consulting, Inc.  I think also interesting is consistently throughout this article, which presents itself as most official journals do, that their numbers could be wrong because of a variety of reasons.

Next COVID-19 phase update from Cooper date?
I was wondering if anyone has heard of when he plans to hold his conference announcing the next steps for the state, whether we go to phase 1/phase 2.5/ phase 3 yet? Historically speaking with these updates he tends to announce plans on Wednesday so businesses have 48 hours to plan for implementation.Thanks in advance for any info.Edit: I answered my own question, according to @NC_governors twitter, he plans to announce plans today it appears at 3pm EST [Link to tweet](https://twitter.com/ncdhhs/status/1275774504728436736)
Probably will be some sort of mask order , though cautious because he doesn't want the legislature overturning him.
I will be shocked if we move forward and would not be surprised if we went back to phase 1
I fully expect a mask order. Its legit low effort policy that would yield tangible results.
No way we go backwards in terms of reclosing places. People are already tired of the restrictions as they are. Telling places they have to shut down again after reopening would be political suicide.
I would be surprised honestly If we went back to phase 1. Even though in an ideal world we would have been stricter about lockdowns in the first place, there is no current extension of unemployment benefits or small business aid past july 31st. So sadly we most likely will either move to a modified phase 2, or phase 3 with a state mandate on facemasks.  If you want to blame someone for the increases in COVID-19 cases, blame the anti-intellectual folks who raised hell to get their nails and hair did, blame have Restaurants, Breweries, and some churches that lobbied to be opened in phase 2 that clearly are not practicing proper social distancing or requiring facemasks in conjunction with retail outlets relaxing safety standards across the states. Blame the folks who clearly don't realize its clearly a bad idea to go to the beach.
I agree we won't be back to phase 1 till September
I don't think it will produce results- the folks who won't wear a mask will find workarounds, head to rural areas where it won't be enforced, they'll do anything to not wear one.  Some businesses will accept their business in order to stay afloat.  If anything, deaths might go up because the burden will shift to rural areas.
>it will be but he has already signaled no enforcement...   >   >   >   >it's you know just a suggestion
> Blame the folks who clearly don't realize its clearly a bad idea to go to the beach.  It's not a bad idea to go to the beach. **Outdoor transmission** of Covid is negligible. You're not going to get Covid from walking by somebody on the beach.
> If you want to blame someone for the increases in COVID-19 cases  Or we could blame the state government for being silent on racial disparities  https://www.newsobserver.com/news/coronavirus/article243618632.html  >As of mid-June, they make up just over 14,000 of positive cases — 44% of the nearly 30,000 cases for which ethnicity is known, according to state health officials.  >That is a dramatic overrepresentation in infections, since Latinos are only 9.3% of the state’s population.   >“I respectfully believe that the [state government] had been keeping this data from the public in a way so that there isn’t a stigma against them and blame wouldn’t be put on the Latino,” said Dr. Viviana Martinez-Bianchi in Spanish, who serves on the state’s marginalized population task force and is a Duke doctor. “But at the same time it’s a problem, because it’s necessary to protect [the community] through data.”  > nails and hair did, blame have Restaurants, Breweries, and some churches  I don't see how those places (outside of some minority neighborhoods) are responsible for the vast over-representation of Covid cases within the Latino community state wide.
I think the results will be proportional to population density. In larger population centers It should at least slow down and stabilize the rate of new COVID-19 cases. If rural areas wanna stick their heads in the ground and not follow data-driven common sense then thats just natural selection.
Its not the beach that's the problem its the shops around the beach where people are shopping without distancing or wearing a mask that's the problem. Even after Dare county announced masks being mandatory people aren't wearing them inside stores.
That only works if people are social distancing, and not sitting within arms reach suntanning for extended periods of time.
Unless you're at a really crowded beach, the only people you're going to be that close to for an extended period of time are the people you specifically went there with, not strangers.  Admittedly, you can turn it into a bad idea by gathering a large group together, but going to the beach with your family, SO, or maybe a small group of friends who only hang out with each other and isolate otherwise should be totally fine. It's certainly not any worse than other places you could hang out, with the possible exception of the public bathroom situation.

UNC faculty and graduate students point to racism and classism in university decision to re-open amid COVID-19
[https://facultygov.unc.edu/2020/06/roadmap-to-racial-equity-at-unc/](https://facultygov.unc.edu/2020/06/roadmap-to-racial-equity-at-unc/) [https://facultygov.unc.edu/files/2020/06/An-Open-Letter-to-Leadership.pdf](https://facultygov.unc.edu/files/2020/06/An-Open-Letter-to-Leadership.pdf)[https://twitter.com/Florence\_dore/status/1265419086894432258](https://twitter.com/Florence_dore/status/1265419086894432258) [https://twitter.com/unc4cola/status/1272519636341477376](https://twitter.com/unc4cola/status/1272519636341477376)
That ridiculous. The college should reopen there is a very small chance of any of the students to die from the disease and the school has put into place multiple safe guards to help protect students and staff from the coronavirus. Also the school has cracked down on racism in faculty and students. Classism shouldn’t be a issue either because staying at college allows those in lower income groups to stay away from older and more vulnerable family members.
There’s a small chance, but there’s still a chance. More importantly, there’s a larger chance that the students or faculty bring something home with them and infect at-risk individuals at the home. Still, thousands are dying a day, THOUSANDS. Why are we all in such a hurry to increase that number? If we stayed in lockdown, we’d be so much further along than we are now.  Also, not everyone can afford on-campus housing. Just saying. I have a B.S. and I’m working on a B.E. and I am and have worked full time all nine years I’ve been in school. Not once could I afford to live on-campus. It’s very expensive and you assuming that’s an option for everyone shows how far disconnected you actually are.
The students are discouraged to travel between campus and home that’s why they got rid of the fall break and holidays. Also as a student I only have on in person class. The faculty is protected from the students with barriers in class rooms. The college students are the least likely to die which means it’s better that they get it and creat an immunity to it than other ages. Also the lockdown was never meant to stop the spread just slow it down. People are going to die from this disease. I can’t afford on campus housing I’ve been working all summer to save up just to rent apartment around college. When I meant on campus I just meant they area around campus which is my fault for not clarifying. Better to get the disease while i’m living in my own place than my house with my family.
I think part of the concern is students are not islands away from their family: administration, dining, housekeeping, course registration and records, parking, building maintenance, grounds keeping, security, mail, etc. are all made up of people whose in-person work becomes compulsory to handle students.  The protections put in place by the university are going to be maintained by those same staff who all face a variety of conditions to support and maintain campus operations, then must return home to their families each evening.  In the choice between accommodations for high-risk individuals and business needs, business needs trump accommodations.   People are going to die, but where's the line?  Let thousands of students from all over the country converge into one space, then travel again wherever and however often and be done with it, if that's the way to reason it.
House keeping and dinning are the only ones that I can see having any reason to talk to or interact with students and we have already put things in place as a society to to minimize risk suck as face mask and gloves. The dining halls will have limited capacity and shielding from students the rest of those jobs you listed can be done mostly online with the exception of ground keeping which has little to no student interaction and is outside. I think if you are healthy and are willing to risk getting sick which you have a very little chance of dying from I think you should be able to go back to college. If it’s not worth it in your eyes then take a semester off. I learn best in the class room when I can interact with the teacher and other students especially in labs and I don’t wanna hurt my gpa or slow my education because of a disease that will have little impact on me. If others don’t feel the same way take a year off I have no problem with that but people got to start there lives back up because no one can stay locked at home forever.
 Here’s a good list of what they are wanting to do.  https://www.reddit.com/r/NCSU/comments/hg848g/summary_of_staff_town_hall/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf
Thanks for sharing these.  Additionally, though, students and faculty flow in and out of buildings with different classes, different administrative needs, wandering in to use a bathroom, ask directions, use the library, buy supplies, etc.; which masks mitigate the risks, but compliance is becoming the biggest issue.  The enforcement of anyone wearing a mask, especially students, isn't going to be clean-cut, and unless you're behind a plastic barrier all the time, it's only going to take one asymptomatic student arguing with you without a mask to escalate a situation.  I can see the collective concern of the burden of effort on faculty and staff with less of an ability to take a year off if they are reluctant to return to full operations.
Not to pit students and faculty and staff on different sides, though. The example could be a non-compliant staff member arguing with a student who has concerns about coming back.
Well I think if a student has concerns about coming back they would talk online. I doubt you would wanna or could schedule an in person meeting about something like this.
Yeah. I was thinking more about classes that aren't going to be offered online or random run-ins in any of the situations we mentioned above.
Wear a mask and social distance just like running into someone you know randomly

An alley without exit.’ Experts worry COVID-19 among Latinos will get dire without support

>As of mid-June, they make up just over 14,000 of positive cases — **44%** of the nearly 30,000 cases for which ethnicity is known, according to state health officials.  >That is a *dramatic overrepresentation* in infections, since Latinos are only **9.3%** of the state’s population.   >“I respectfully believe that the [state government] had been keeping this data from the public in a way so that there isn’t a stigma against them and blame wouldn’t be put on the Latino,” said Dr. Viviana Martinez-Bianchi in Spanish, who serves on the state’s marginalized population task force and is a Duke doctor. “But at the same time it’s a problem, because it’s necessary to protect [the community] through data.”
And are some of the worst for wearing masks and social distancing.   My personal observations.
"Will"?
“I know we should stay home,” Irma had told The News & Observer and Enlace Latino NC in an interview, “but for communities like ours, that is difficult ... we must work at whatever cost.”  yeah, no one else, of any race, has this same problem but still stays at home
To be fair, I think all groups are probably equally bad at masks and social distancing, more or less. What's bad is, the general lack of attention by the government and media in addressing this population who are super over-represented in Covid cases. Like they're 14% of the population of Durham County, but [almost **75%** of cases](https://durhampublichealth-durhamnc.hub.arcgis.com/datasets/28d63775a4fd44d3991fd517b3925438).  I guess most folks (stay at homers) want to blame hair salons, beaches, breweries and tattoo/nail shops for the rise in cases in NC, without looking too closely at the (demographic) data.   It's easier to blame hair salons/breweries for spreading Covid, instead of addressing the unique challenges of the communities who are disproportionately impacted by this virus.
It's very easy however to blame areas where a lot of people are shoved in close areas with low pay and little health care options...  Like meat plants. The biggest rises in cases of COVID from eastern counties in NC (the ones the WH is currently worried about) are all due to meat plants.   I wonder who works at meat plants?   Those people go to salons, breweries, grocery stores and spread the disease just as easily. If we don't figure out how to keep people apart from each other and to wear masks, its just going to be a never ending cycle of COVID spikes and local shutdowns.
I’m well aware of the housing situation as well.

My family tested positive for coronavirus today. Be careful out there.
Just had some bad news today. Be safe out there guys. I started to feel like things were normal and this was a wake up call that they are not. We are in the Orange County area. My father is 55 and a past smoker so I’m really worried. But yeah be safe guys please still take this seriously
Any idea where they got it from? This is probably selfish of me, but I hope that everyone working remote and socially distancing is able to avoid getting it.
That sucks, buddy. It's easy to relax after such a long time, too. Hopefully, everyone comes out okay.
Everyone in your family tested positive?
I’m sorry to hear that your family is going through this. Thank you for posting this and reminding folks that the threat of contracting Covid is still with us. I hope y’all recover quickly and completely.
Oh I’m sorry to hear that, keep up us posted on how y’all are doing if you have a little time. Any idea how it was contracted or when? There seems to be variance in the incubation period.
Sorry to hear that. Are the symptoms they are having really bad?
What lead him or you to being tested? What symptoms
Thank you for posting to share this and bring awareness to what many seem to have forgotten, that this is nowhere close to over despite how society makes it appear. I truly hope your family members have a speedy recovery!
Heard its an infection of the blood vessels, which explains why it harms the elderly more. Ask your doc for medicine related to securing vessels plaques. Goodluck.  source: [https://elemental.medium.com/coronavirus-may-be-a-blood-vessel-disease-which-explains-everything-2c4032481ab2](https://elemental.medium.com/coronavirus-may-be-a-blood-vessel-disease-which-explains-everything-2c4032481ab2)  it links to some scholarly articles
They weren't participating in the ReOpen protest were they?
We don’t know. My dad does remodeling work with his brother  but does not come in close contact with the clients. Might be from grocery store. He really doesn’t come in  contact with many people
Did you do anything interesting 14 days ago?
Did you guys use mask?
This is unproven, but it seems likely to me.  However, it is not at all clear that it is *always* an infection of the blood vessels.  It may be that most cases stay in the respiratory tract.
Covid binds to the ACE2 receptor which is found on cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidney, and intestines.

Reported coronavirus hospitalizations in NC reach another single-day high


NC Senate looks to reopen gyms, overturn Gov. Cooper’s coronavirus order

They want us all exposed quickly to get herd immunity faster? /s
Can’t Cooper veto this?
I'm a little late to comment, but this isn't about gyms. It's a political move by the NC Senate to get Cooper on record vetoing reopening plans, therefore making it look like the Democrats are still holding us hostage. Couple this with the RNC potentially leaving and they've got solid headlines to push against Cooper during the fall. "Cooper kicks out RNC" "Cooper refuses to reopen, shuttering small businesses" *Democrats have taken this state hostage. It's time to take back what's ours. Vote Forrest*
Clearly they should just hang a cross on the gym buildings and have some guy walk around the weight room talking about Jesus.  There, now it's a church and it can legally be open.
This is NOT ESSENTIAL !!! You can go and run in the park or even do some push ups or something outdoors!
I tried too. I sure didn't think it would be like this. Lots  of disenfectant,mask and stuff like that on Amazon for anyone who needs anything.
Wonderful. Going to again post what I said before.  >I work at a major retailer and it’s insane how it’s ok for people to pack themselves inside a store where they will breath, sweat, and touch things but I can’t go to the gym for those same reasons. A Walmart or Target will see way more foot traffic during the day than a gym will.  >And despite what these “essential” companies are saying in the media, we aren’t actually cleaning anything or enforcing social distancing. We stopped that weeks ago. It’s business as usual just with face masks so it looks like we really doing something. Those fast food employees working in that small kitchen aren’t doing anything to make your processed foods any less contaminated with COVID.  >A gym, because of its nature, will actually have to enforce those social distancing and sanitation requirements.  Literally makes no sense for everything to be open except gyms.
Gyms were ready to open with social distancing measures. Cooper blindsided them
Good!  It’s well past time for this nonsense to end.
Please open this shit up i want to go visit my family
I'm pretty certain every person who has said the phrase herd immunity in earnest over the past several months has no idea what herd immunity actually is or how it works.
People are already getting exposed with the governor decrees places to be open or not
Even the health officials will agree that to achieve herd immunity it will take literal years. Even if it was allowed to run wild.   They have no purpose other than wanting to be assholes and make money regardless of human health and safety. Capitalism is the problem, Greed is the byproduct.
He can. Will he? At least he can cite the recent case in the Supreme Court where California churches tried side stepping the governors decision on crowd restrictions.  Here's a link for reference...

There is people (like me) that use exercise as a form of therapy, I use the barbell to relief all my stress, and let me tell you something, in those times i am more stressed than ever... And running in the park or doing pushups or even pullups can NEVER replicate the sensation of 500 lbs on your back. That is something that you would probaby not understand, but go on keep judging people for wanting to go improve themselves.  And enough with the "Not essential" talk... Define essential my guy... Essential for survival ? Then literally only supermarkets should be open, and thats not the case.  If only the essential should be open why are restaurants open, why are barbershops open and so on ?  The people keeping gyms closed clearly have no idea what a gym actually is.
Then don’t go to the gym.  Problem solved.
I can tell you dont go to the gym.   It isn't essential for you to stand in line at Walmart shopping for Easter and 4th of July decorations and yet I still saw hundreds of people do it.   Don't like it, dont go to the gym.
Hope you're joking...
A very few gyms were 'ready to open' as were a very few bars. The majority were not in anyway close to being ready to being open. Many restaurants were not ready and still haven't opened.   Anywhere were there are large gatherings of people in small enclosed places are going to spread disease, plain and simple. Add in it just takes one knucklehead to not wash equipment, or you trusting some underpaid person to ensure its clean between every use, along with no masks, classes, and recirculated air, you have a pretty damn good place to spread disease around.   The 'gym' nor a 'private club/bar' are essential right now, you just want to have a reason to complain on the internet.
enclosed room, recycled air, strenuous activity where you're exhaling, perfectly ok with a contagious virus going around.
Because if they open the Gyms, the virus will disappear? Nearly 2 million infected, 109,000 dead, and that's with social distancing and basically shutting off parts of the economy. There will be a massive second wave, and then the virus will shut down the gyms. The reason this pandemic is worse in the USA than any other place is that we ignored it and acted too late. Now you think it's going to just go away because you're tired of it?  People don't want to die, they aren't going to be coming to the gym unless they're dumb as hell.
You can visit your family right now. Whether that's actually a good idea or not is entirely up to you. Governor order has no bearing on you visiting family.
Thank you for saying that. People jumped on this term parroting what they heard on the news with no understanding of the variables involved.
Well, except the people talking about vaccines, noting that we need at least 80% of the population to have immunity (presumably from a vaccine) to safeguard those for whom it does not work, or who cannot take it due to a legitimate health risk.
The places open are deemed lower risk with precautions (masks, 6 feet, lower capacity, etc) while other venues are still higher risk. We are already seeing the (anticipated) spike for going to phase 2 -- Why accelerate more without trying to stabilize first?  I wouldn't be opposed to a phase 2b that opens up more at the 3 or so week mark after phase 2, but just opening without hitting any markers is throwing caution to the wind and exposing all of NC to risk (to me).
It’s very partisan and he’s just stood up to Trump and the RNC so we’ll soon see!
He’d need to get out of N.C. courts first. He lost his case to keep churches closed.
Fortunately, the NC legislature doesn’t have to care about this US Supreme Court ruling in the slightest when passing state laws.  God speed, NC legislators!  Get us out of this media induced panic and get us back to our regular lives!
It's not about the gyms in the context of the NC Senate attempting to reopen them. The NC Senate is looking for something to press against Cooper and gyms staying closed are it. If we had a Republican governor and gyms were still closed, the NC Senate wouldn't be pursuing this.
Not how viruses work little buddy. No wonder the government has to come shut things down when ignorance like yourself still somehow still manage to exist.
Blast your glutes at home girlfriend
Sounds like you don’t want to go to a gym so that’s your choice. Some people who rely on the gym for mental and physical health have been struggling with gyms closed. I’m not saying let everyone who wants to go to the gym in at once. But they had systems in place for social distancing. I work part time at a gym so I saw it first hand. Unless you work at a gym you don’t know if they had measures in place to open. Sounds like you are scared or have preexisting conditions but I hate to tell you this virus isn’t going anywhere so are we supposed to close gyms forever?
You're saying my brothel needs to shut down too?! \\s
So Walmart and Target?
More people in NC go to churches than gyms, and some churches even have gym equipment and fitness classes  We'll see a wave of cases come from churches before they come from gyms
That will not happen.  Good luck to you.
It's like people don't actually pay attention to the guidelines and instead regurgitate bs they've been spoon fed or just make it up themselves.
You're absolutely right about that. Most of what I have been hearing is from people against masks and against social distancing who say that we have to 'open back up and let the healthy people build herd immunity.'
If they were using it that way, that would be much less dumb.
It may be that with the more recent US Supreme Court ruling cited above that the state courts' hands are tied. I haven't heard whether there was something to distinguish the California case from ours or not.
I already know this.
Weird, if they are just focusing on gyms, why not open bars as well?! (The same senator did introduce a bill for bars to have 50% outdoor seating.)  And did you read the requirements? 50% capacity, temp checks, masks for staff, along with signs that caution going to a gym. Just like most the resturaunts that are not open due to the requirements, this wouldn't help many gyms, and is just more posturing by the GOP.   Glad you seem to just be another idiot on the internet with no actual power though.
That's very incorrect. US Supreme Court rulings are binding at all levels of government.  Also, over 100,000 people are dead, including a small child this week. I think it's the rash of novel deaths that's causing the consternation.
I was just commenting on your indistinction between calisthenics and weightlifting, because it seemed ludicrous. There are obvious differences and one cannot simply substitute calisthenics for weightlifting exercises, hence why the two exist and are commonly differentiated.
Gyms were deemed as not essential, as there are many many other ways to still exercise.   While some gyms 'may' be prepared (small gyms with limited customers), larger gyms like say the Y are not and would not be prepared for the regulations requested, and even the ones going through the senate, not a single gym owner or person that works at one said they would be ready for those (100% mask use, sanitizing after each equipment use along with temperature checks of every person coming into the building and no more than 50% capacity).   I hate to tell you, the virus does go away if you have less people congregated together, are the R value of the virus goes down and has no one to spread to and with that in mind, you don't have to have very much concern about vaccine development, and then can focus on contact tracing and shut downs of quarantine areas when the pop up. Really simple science stuff here buddy.
Why would you need a /s, everyone knows that Neveda is the only place for legal brothels.
0.o. essential business much?
Who's strenuously breathing at Target?
 [https://www.scotusblog.com/2020/05/court-declines-to-lift-restrictions-on-crowds-at-church-services/](https://www.scotusblog.com/2020/05/court-declines-to-lift-restrictions-on-crowds-at-church-services/)   Churches already got smacked down for trying to sidestep state orders. Do you think Gyms have a snowballs chance? Good luck...
Well, NC is seeing higher hospitalizations and increased deaths currently, likely from the relaxed restrictions. The phases for opening were only supposed to go into place if we met the set criteria. We haven't met it, so why do you think places should be open?
The rate of infection is continuing to grow. Have a look.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMre6IAAAiU  100K deaths from this disease in the US in 4 months.
It takes actual YEARS (this is not singular, this IS plural, meaning more than one) to achieve herd immunity. We'd have a vaccine far sooner than that.
Research has not demonstrated that exposure to and/or recovery from COVID-19 makes you immune. Blindly assuming that we will get herd immunity this way is like trying to get herd immunity for the flu or whooping cough: you're not necessarily going to be immune and a lot of people would likely die.  I like to let scientists do the science.
Ours was unique because Cooper allowed most non-essential businesses to reopen with new guidelines but left out churches. The Judge said that Cooper couldn't treat churches differently than other businesses that were open.   If most non-essential businesses were closed then the ruling would have been different.   Plus, States have different executive order powers so it is hard to directly compare cases.

"Essential" when they haven't ever closed up their non essential areas and the majority of the people in those stores arent buying essentials.
Churches were already successful in their N.C. efforts. And are currently open. They actually could open in phase 1.  I’d say the Bar’s lawsuit has a better chance of being successful than the gyms, since Cooper is singling them out (taprooms, breweries, wineries etc are all open) but don’t act like these lawsuits are fruitless.    At least in N.C. anyway.
Dumbass over here wants everything open so they can terrorize retail workers and people of the like. Just some dumb asshole, we’d be better off without them existing
Thank you for clarifying that.
You aren't in the same place for hours in a taproom, brewery or winery. You're in, search for what you want and you're out.   Gyms are much different than that. People are in there for hours at a time heavily respirating, sharing equipment and breathing recycled air. What ever happened to using what you have to exercise anyway? People forgot how to do a push up? Run? Sit-up...I mean there's options if people just use some ingenuity.   Gyms should stay closed and this shouldn't even be a discussion.
While those particular studies show promise, they're far from conclusive or applicable to human cases. More research is still needed before we decide to risk innocent lives.
> You're in, search for what you want and you're out.  What places you’ve been to like that? I’ve never seen one. They act just like bars where I go. You might be confused in to how they operated in phase 1 and now where they can have 50% indoor + outdoor seating.   People drinking and sitting around. Just now with a little More space between tables and barstools

North Carolina hits 1,000 reported coronavirus-related deaths

While the protests are important, we shouldn't forget a pandemic is going on still. The thing I say from the article that is worrisome was:  > With 89 percent of hospitals reporting statewide, inpatient beds were at 76 percent capacity; intensive-care beds, 85 percent, according to the state’s DHHS.  Everyone needs to try their best to mind social distancing, face masks and washing their hands often.
I wish I had a bunker I could hide in
That's not really worrisome, hospitals typically run at between 70 and 90% capacity for beds and ICU beds, with higher percentages in under-served areas. It's not like on a typical day a hospital's ICU is 2% full, that makes no sense, the equipment and space is incredibly expensive.
I've also been noticing hospitalizations and ventilator use pretty much holding steady but ICU use increasing for the past week. Kind of strange. Not sure if the riots are contributing to ICU use, though?

NC hits new high in daily new cases of coronavirus

The number will continue to rise for some time as a result of more infections + more testing + more idiots failing to do the basics of preventing the spread of the disease.
This is much more likely from the reopen stuff and the racetrack stuff.  The protest stuff is going to be next week's spike.  At least that one was for a just cause and not haircuts and minor league auto racing.
These headlines are so alarmist. The percent positive has remained \~7%.  No shit they're going to find more cases when they test more people. There's a giant graph in your link that shows we're actually lower for percent positive than a month ago.
Imagine that.
PikachuFace.jpeg
What's a bit more alarming is that hospitalizations per day have been trending up since 5/10.   We aren't supposed to enter Phase III until both number of cases come down for two weeks (hasn't happened at all yet) and hospitalizations go down for two weeks (hasn't happened at all yet).   With a very small overall percentage of North Carolinian's being infected so far, its more numbers we should keep an eye on.   We are currently easily in the top 10 states in the US of new cases per day now.
It's actually more accurate to say 8.5-9.5%  https://covid19.ncdhhs.gov/dashboard/testing  Hasn't been at 7% area since 5/19.
On NC's site, I'm seeing % positive around 9% the last few days. Hasn't dropped below 8% in two weeks. Of course with 10% being the highest number we've seen in a month, that means  this new daily high is 100% because of more tests being administered, and does not signify a spike. But no one wants to run a story with the headline "Things pretty much the same today as yesterday."   That said, hospitalizations have crept up, and ICU beds in particular have been at about 85% of capacity for several days. That's the number to watch. More cases without more hospitalizations seems like it would mean we're on track to have more people recovered from the disease, which /should/ mean more people immune and should slow the spread in the long run, but if the hospitals fill up, things could go sideways in a hurry.
Spoiler: we will enter phase III regardless
> What's a bit more alarming is that hospitalizations per day have been trending up since 5/10.  -More hospitals are reporting, so that explains the increased numbers of hospitalizations.   >https://www.heraldsun.com/news/coronavirus/article243199091.html  >The number of patients hospitalized by COVID-19 jumped by 66 to 716. That information came as 89% of hospitals reported data on Tuesday, compared to 75% on Monday.  >We aren't supposed to enter Phase III until both number of cases come down for two weeks (hasn't happened at all yet) and hospitalizations go down for two weeks (hasn't happened at all yet).  Those benchmarks seem bit arbitrary when we're testing more and more hospitals are reporting   Our new deaths are trending down:  https://www.wral.com/coronavirus/ (from chart)  https://www.wral.com/coronavirus/nc-fails-white-house-benchmarks-for-reopening-health-experts-say/19105381/  >So far, North Carolina has hit benchmarks for low flu-like illness activity and **sufficient hospital capacity**. But it's the trendline for new cases, however, that scored the state the lowest on the project's three-color scale.  >North Carolina leaders have attributed the spike in cases to increased testing. For more than two weeks, the state has met or exceeded Cooper's goal of 5,000 to 7,000 tests conducted a day on average.  https://www.newsobserver.com/news/coronavirus/article243299221.html  >Dr. Mandy Cohen, the DHHS secretary, says the most encouraging metric has been the percentage of people who visit emergency rooms with COVID-19 symptoms. That percentage has been declining, though state officials acknowledge that overall traffic to emergency rooms has increased, perhaps as people’s fears about seeking treatment for non-COVID illnesses subsides.  >The other two metrics — the number of new cases and the percentage of people tested who are positive — paint a mixed picture. Nearly 9,300 people have tested positive since Memorial Day, an increase of 39%. But the percentage of tests that are positive remains steady, **suggesting much of the increase is due to more extensive testing**.  >Cohen notes that North Carolina hospitals **still have plenty of capacity to treat coronavirus and other patients**, even with the resumption of non-urgent procedures. As of Friday, there were about 3,700 hospital beds and 521 intensive care unit beds available in the state, according to DHHS.
I mean the linked website for the article shows ~7%, I was just going off of the data presented in this thread
And Cooper just vetoed the bar bill to open outdoor seating for bars, literally citing the stuff I posted earlier. You can link all you want, but NC is not ready to open because it has not met its metrics of number of cases or hospitalizations which were guided by the CDC, then Federal guidance.   Not sure why you keep trying to argue with me, there is no 'right or wrong' here dude.
Any political will to actually control the coronavirus has now left and likely won’t return until we see a second wave. Unfortunately its an election year

Coronavirus Cases Are Rising in 20 U.S. States, With Sharp Spikes in Arizona, North Carolina and California

I’ve done to terms with the fact that a large percentage of people will not go back to quarantine no matter how bad the numbers get. But, keeping politics out of it, what will it take to at least abide to social distancing/mask wearing and other preventative measures while out in public?  You can go to get your hair cut but why can’t there be some mutual respect and concern for society as whole and wear a mask and keep your distance? I am genuinely curious...is it just a rebellious trait? Hatred for yourself? Hate other people?
Not suprised at all. Fiance and I bought a canoe so we could have fun outdoors while being safe and social distancing from others. Sunday we came upon a group of 40-50 people tubing down the Yadkin River. Literally tied all the tubes together and were a giant floating island of people. Then they got out and partied on the shore. It was pretty crazy.  Witnessed similar crowds at Moratock Park in Danbury when we were canoeing the Dan River on Saturday. Huge crowds of people tubing and even bigger crowds of 75+ on the river beach.
I live in Southern Pines, but travelled through Cary today en route to the coast. I was baffled by the fact that only workers were wearing masks at Taziki and the gas station I stopped at. Even in Southern Pines (which I would argue is almost rural) mask wearing is prevalent. I honestly don’t get it. I thought Cary was so much more progressive than this.
NC is doomed, everything is about politics, the hypocrisy of it all is overwhelming. People will post their entire lives on FB, Reddit, Twitter or Instagram but in the same breath whine and cry about someone taking their temperature before entering a establishment, claiming it violates their privacy. The real question is who and how many have to get sick before people wake up and take this serious.  The next outrageous claim is going to be the temperature scanners they use to take your temperature is actually used to read your thoughts.
I'm pleased to report that the public in Chapel Hill is doing pretty well with masks. Granted, the only places in go are Home Depot and the grocery store, but I'd say the percentage of mask wearers is over 50%, probably well over it. It'd be nice to see it even higher, but it's not bad here.
It's absolutely baffling to me that NC can't grasp the fact that they are still on the first wave and haven't peaked - yesterday the Health and Human Services Secretary held a press conference stating how bad things are getting in the state...and then I see that prep (high school) sports can start up again on June 15.   WHAT. THE. FUCK.  >“I was very appreciative of that call because she is looking at the data that we are looking at and the trends … in the wrong direction,” Health and Human Services Secretary Mandy Cohen said.  [https://www.northcarolinahealthnews.org/2020/06/08/coronavirus-today-june-8/](https://www.northcarolinahealthnews.org/2020/06/08/coronavirus-today-june-8/)  >“We’re concerned that a number of virus metrics are trending upward,” Cooper said at a media briefing Monday afternoon. “Our important mission of opening school buildings on time could be affected by the failure to slow the spread. We do not want that to happen.  So let me see if I understand...the data is trending in the wrong direction, and we won't open schools unless the data starts trending in the right direction...but we are *going to open schools anyway*?!?
I wonder if all of the protests have anything to do with it? Personal gatherings are limited but I am under the impression it can’t spread at large protests with 1000’s of people. Costco and SAM’s also appear to be safer as well in comparison to small businesses.
They’re doing more testing.
I wonder if protesting in large groups is healthy? I mean, the media said it's ok. Meanwhile, the WHO just said it's extremely rare to be transmissable if you're not showing symptoms. Time to reopen and let people make their own decisions.
That’s sucks but we’re not staying on lockdown forever I know that might be hard for some to hear.
I totally agree that masks need to be mandatory here like in Virginia. Insane that people can just go about their business unprotected. Too many people don’t understand masking and still think they are only risking themselves. And there’s still so many people out here that think they look silly or sissy in a mask.
I think it’s because Americans have been fed “freedom” for so long, that they don’t care about anyone else.  All they care about is their freedom to not do what is in the best interest of everyone else.
[https://www.psypost.org/2020/06/psychopathic-traits-linked-to-non-compliance-with-social-distancing-guidelines-amid-the-coronavirus-pandemic-56980](https://www.psypost.org/2020/06/psychopathic-traits-linked-to-non-compliance-with-social-distancing-guidelines-amid-the-coronavirus-pandemic-56980)
The State should have mandated masks from the outset. Unless you have a medical condition there's no reason you shouldn't be able to wear a mask.  I fall on the side of this isn't as bad as alarmists make it seem, but it's been proven that wearing masks significantly reduces the spread and it's easy to do.
It's hard to say. For mask wearing, it *ought* to be pretty simple - but knowing America, it won't be. Ideally, it'd need to be blasted through the media (particularly fox news) and with stores requiring it.  For social distancing, I don't think it's entirely possible - particularly with the protests going on. People just won't stay 6 feet apart - however, anecdotally social distancing outside of protests (in terms of when you go see your friends and family and stuff) is still pretty large in my social circles. To extend that to others, though.. hard to know how to make that happen. Again, the only thing I can really think of is having the media hammer home the importance of it?
Ugh. I loved floating the Yadkin when I lived near there because I'd never see anyone. What stretch?
cary is not progressive.  they have taken several active measures to push poor people out of town over the years.
Interchange “progressive” for intelligent
The amount of bullshit Facebook conspiracy that has come out during this whole thing honestly scares the shit out of me.   We have MDs and PhDs who have been working on this crap for decades, but no let’s listen to Daryl the local loon who chain smokes cigarettes and goes through a 12 pack of Mountain Dew a day about how Bill Gates is behind all of this and is just using it as a ploy to microchip us.  Like Bill Gates has nothing better to do than to watch your dumb ass on a monitor all day.
Positive tests do not mean positive death. The WHO said just yesterday that it is RARE to spread if you're not showing symptoms. It's not about compliance, it's about using your head. We SHOULD be protecting and isolating the people showing symptoms while letting people go back to work. The hospitals are ready for this "2nd wave" y'all are worried about. Let me ask you this, if you care so much, why are you not outraged about the thousands protesting during a pandemic? The point may be valid, but is it worth shutting the country for another 2 months? You are all so angry about people not wearing a mask, but when it comes to protesting you back down. Be consistent.
The increase started way before the protests. It started about a week after Phase 1 began. An increase from the protests would only really begin to show up today, now a week after they started, and probably won't completely show up for another week or so as most people don't get tested the moment they feel symptoms.
It may have spread significantly during the women’s march in Madrid.   People shouting seems risky.
It goes beyond that.  Hospitalizations are up as well as other metrics that go beyond “more testing.”   Not trying to instigate; just stating the facts.
The criteria for getting testing hasn’t changed; you must have symptoms.  A more accurate conclusion is that more people are symptomatic, therefore we are seeing more positive test results.
Okay.. but if we're not on lockdown, then all these fucking dumbasses need to start wearing a mask and staying 6 feet apart.... for fucks sakes.
We paddled from Old 421 Park in Lewisville to Dinkins Bottom Rd in Yadkinville. It was our first time on the Yadkin and we were disappointed there were no rapids. Can you recommend a section that has rapids? Can't find any info on it. We're used to the Dan River which is pretty exciting.
My bad for thinking Cary was progressive. I grew up in Southern California where the homeless were routinely shipped “elsewhere” and the poor were marginalized severely. Moving to NC I thought things were a little less severe. Clearly I was wrong. I thought Cary was better than it is.
live right next to cary and can confirm, there’s tons of elitism in the preston areas
Don't be shy, tell us how you really feel. ;-)
Show me where I mentioned anything about protests.
It’s rare to spread if you are fully asymptomatic but it’s not rare to spread if you are presymptomatic. According to the director of the Harvard Global Health Institute, presymptomatic spread could be 40-60% of spread. So just because no one around you is coughing, it doesn’t mean that you are safe.
Many if not most the protesters were masked for the police brutality protests, as opposed to the gun carrying open up the state protests.  Also, I understand that people being murdered by the police want to do something about that.  We literally have police breaking into homes and executing people... https://www.npr.org/2020/05/13/855705278/sleeping-while-black-louisville-police-kill-unarmed-black-woman  But you want to draw some false equivalence?  Get your head out of your ass.
The headline said cases are rising, not hospitalizations. That’s what I responded to.
The criteria for getting tested absolutely has changed. There are significantly more tests available now and they are testing much more than just the worst of the worst. They are also targeting hot spots of congregate care facilities and prisons for testing which will obviously make numbers go up.   [https://www.newsobserver.com/news/coronavirus/article242760036.html](https://www.newsobserver.com/news/coronavirus/article242760036.html)    &#x200B;  >Dr. Mandy Cohen, secretary of the state Department of Health and Human Services, said the categories of people who should be [tested for the coronavirus ](https://www.newsobserver.com/news/rebuild/article242766511.html)have expanded, including any patient who is suspected of having COVID-19.   >   >The guidance is meant for clinicians to raise awareness of people who are more likely to be exposed to COVID-19 or are to be at risk of serious illness, Cohen said.   >   >“We want them to think about testing for those communities,” Cohen told reporters at a news briefing Friday.   >   >That list now includes: anyone clinicians think may have had close contact with an infected person, regardless of symptoms; people who have underlying health conditions; members of “historically marginalized populations”; people who live or have contact in “high-risk settings” (such as homeless shelters, correctional facilities, long-term care facilities); health-care workers and first responders; and employees who work in places like grocery stores and gas stations, where social distancing is more difficult.   >   >The expanded list is a sharp departure from previous state guidance, which strictly limited testing.
Downvote all you want to...end of June we’re out of lockdown just don’t go crying about it all day when it happens
Used to put in at Old 421	all the time :) the best stretch that I know of for rapids is probably Shoals/Pilot Mt. State Park -> Donnaha. I believe I saw something about the Donnaha access getting closed for bridge construction, though.  I highly recommend Paddling Eastern NC by Paul Ferguson. It breaks down floats in most of NC (Yadkin and Dan basin, included) and lists rapids.
CA native living in Cary.  Mask wearing is not prevalent, even in stores that have signs that say "please wear a mask" at the door.  I think it is an entitlement problem.
cary doesnt allow normal signs for busisnesses.  carys government is so annoying ikea decided to not deal with them and canceled their plans for a store. in the 90s they spent so much time suing mc donalds over the colors of their building it was stupid.  cary used to have a few trailer parks and they changed the zoning and developers came in and ran those people out. its a town that most of the services workers who work there cant afford to live in.  i have issues with cary.
For what it’s worth, COVID units are filling up fast and new units are being opened to take the extra load. And it’s accelerating since we started reopening. That’s the best indication that it’s spreading.
Appreciate the article, and have lots of respect for Mandy Cohen, but health care providers who are in direct contact with COVID-19 positive patients are not being tested - this is firsthand knowledge, I have no motivation to lie.  The vast majority of us are ineligible for testing, which has not changed since this whole mess started.
I didn't downvote you. I'm back at work .. and no one is wearing a mask.
Cry all you want, we were **never** on lockdown.
Honestly.... I'm fucking concerned. The virus is real. Wearing a mask helps. Wearing a mask isn't a fucking sign of weakness. Wearing a mask isn't a political statement... and fuck republicans for believing that.
 I'd looked into the book but wasn't sure if it was worth it. If it lists out rapids it's definitely worth it to me! Thanks for that recommendation!
Containment area of relocated karens.
IKEA didn't bail on Cary because of the local government. It was a result of their change in business strategy:  "They are moving away from suburban big box retail outlets and into global city centers"   [https://www.wral.com/oh-no-ikea-is-not-coming-to-cary-after-all/17575167/](https://www.wral.com/oh-no-ikea-is-not-coming-to-cary-after-all/17575167/)   In fact, if you read the article, IKEA actually praised the Cary town council.
I did that to tweet you. It worked.
Exactly! I’m sick of people complaining about how we were on “lockdown.” In Madrid, police were patrolling the streets checking that people were only going to the grocery store. Children weren’t allowed outside for 6 weeks. That’s a lockdown.
I'd say most liberals aren't wearing masks, even if more of them are than republicans. No one is wearing masks. People in general have no regard for others.
I’m not republican so don’t know what political party your with has too do with this...my work requires we wear and mask and we’re fine. Talk to your boss about masks if your so concerned, just Don’t go blaming a certain party when everyone was out protesting for BLM when all of them were liberal and not social distancing..every party whether dems or republicans are too blame. Personally for me I’m living my life and going to a bar first thing when we enter phase 3. That’s my choice you can stay home forever if you want. Have a good day.
can i steal this?
it didnt stop their stores going into similar non global cities like norfolk. its called tact and public relations.
Damn dats crazy...move to Madrid then if you love there lockdown so much.
Yes! But only if I can speak to your manager first.
So I assume when they simultaneously cancelled their plans for a Nashville store in 2018 it was also a local government issue and not a shift in business strategy.

Tweek, man bun. Jeezus! You’re lit up because of your belief in a failed ideology. Talk about a Kool-Aid overdose!
I would love to move to Madrid. Spain has one of the highest qualities of life, I love it there. But moving to a new country is easier said than done, especially this year!
he is currently on the phone, if you wait here i will send him right over.  [but i wont](https://media1.tenor.com/images/0c3e804598b944816312f2f5d696f383/tenor.gif?itemid=9847616)
maybe, i do know that a lot of companies who have looked into cary pulled out because the city government is a pain in the ass to deal with. its been like that since the mid 90s.  holy shit that artice is biased against ikea too.  use better examples.
WTF?

Roy Cooper recommends coronavirus testing for anyone that has been to a protest (even if asymptomatic), how do we get tested without a doctor's referral?
Roy Cooper recently held a media briefing for coronavirus ( [https://abc11.com/health/latest-nc-hits-new-record-high-of-739-hospitalizations/6236952/](https://abc11.com/health/latest-nc-hits-new-record-high-of-739-hospitalizations/6236952/)  3:00PM Update) in which he recommended and pushed for anyone who has "been in any kind of crowd" to get tested. He went on to elaborate that even if you are asymptomatic you should be tested if you have recently been in any kind of crowd, such as a protest.I have recently been to a protest, and want to get tested as per Cooper's recommendation, though when I look up how to get tested, I can't find hardly any results or help. Pretty much everything I've read has said that I need to have symptoms to be tested, with some saying I would need referral from a doctor in order to have any kind of test done.I'm confused as to what needs to be done. I don't know why Cooper would push for people to do something in a formal briefing if it isn't even possible to do.My ultimate question is where can I get testing as an asymptomatic individual that has recently been to a large gathering? Thank you all.
If you have a CVS near you, many are testing without a referral. You do need to call ahead.
NC DHHS (Department of Health and Human Services) is a great place to check if your health care provider isn’t helpful or doesn’t exist.   https://covid19.ncdhhs.gov/about-covid-19/testing#where-can-i-find-a-nearby-testing-site-location   You can also try calling 211 the COVID19 hotline. I haven’t tried it, but it might be helpful.  It seems that there isn’t strong vetting or regulation of the sites. Do your research first. It’s probably much better to get an approval from your primary care doctor or your local hospital.  ALSO, know which testing equipment was used. There is no such thing as perfect. Most tests I’ve read about have good odds of giving a right answer, but there are a lot of factors that can throw off results. For example, maybe you just got it and you haven’t built up a detectable viral load.  Therefore, ASSUME you have it and don’t want to give it to anyone. Wear a mask, limit exposure to other people for two weeks. Starting now. Recommendations from the government are light here in my opinion. This is only my opinion so take it for what that’s worth.  If you do end up coming down with it: tell everyone. Make sure people you were in contact with are aware and ask them to limit their exposure. Work closely with your primary care doctor as well.  We have to work together to curtail the virus. Our only effective strategy right now is to limit the spread. We’re a lot better treating patients, but it’s still a life or death disease for a lot of people. It also seems that COVID19 can do crippling damage to survivors. Do what you can to save lives.
Have you tried calling your doctor and asking if they'd write you a referral for a test since you've had a high-risk exposure?
You can get an in-home test from LabCorp. Google “LabCorp pixel covid test” and you should be able to find it. Even my janky insurance covered the test for free.   It’s sent to your house and contains very specific instructions. Easy to follow, just read everything before you start - it needs to be done when you can drop it in a fedex box the same day.
There are testing sites all over the state. At some blood donation sites you get a free test if you donate blood.
Many FQHCs are doing free testing.  https://npidb.org/organizations/ambulatory_health_care/federally-qualified-health-center-fqhc_261qf0400x/nc/  I know folks with mobile testing units doing rotations in gastonia statesville and lexington with another being set up so they will probably add lincolnton and hickory.
Walgreens in guess rd in Durham has no appointment drive through testing.
The health department in most counties are doing them.
He also said that people shouldn't run money making businesses since it can harm people... So Target, Wal Mart, Lowes, HD anyone??? Logic escapes.
Do you know how much it would cost to get a test done
their website doesnt include NC as a testing state
It is nearly impossible le for a layperson to perform a successful nasopharyngeal swab. Be very wary of the results from at home tests that claim you can simply swab the nostril.
really? calling my local blood bank tmrw
who do i need to speak with at my local HD to get tested?
No, but I bet they will tell you when you call.
I was tested last week and received a bill for ~$125 pre-insurance.
if you have BCBSNC, they said all covid related expenses are covered/free
Google N.C. COVID testing, that’s how I found them listed. There were several places in N.C.
I’ve now had two covid tests - the LabCorp At home nasal swab and one in the ER, both came back negative. Unsurprising, because I wasn’t able to access any test while I had the initial symptoms. Eventually, I will get an antibody test.
That's for antibody, not live virus though. So if currently infected won't help yet
Was this at CVS? I just found that Walgreens says they're doing free testing
my local cvs told me only raleigh & clayton has it RN
No, I had to go to a testing center.  Results in three days (negative, thank goodness).
The Walgreens in Durham County was great. I made an appointment online, drove up, did my swab, and got my results about 12 hours later. Totally free. They never even looked at my insurance information. They don't advertise it, but they had a line for people without an appointment too (though I think they only do a limited number of those per day).
Well, try the health department. There’s plenty of testing sites.
We have a CVS in lil ‘ol Statesville that is testing...FYI

CDC wants states to count ‘probable’ coronavirus cases and deaths, but most aren’t doing it (NC is one of them)

Considering the spike in 'pneumonia' deaths in a lot of states as compared to their 5-year averages, I think this is important for people to understand the actual impact of the virus.

Reported coronavirus hospitalizations reach another new high in North Carolina

And yet Dan Forrest continues to bitch about how we aren't fully reopened yet.  What a tool.
The number of hospitals reporting rose by 8% from the previous day. Reported hospitalizations rose by less than 5%. Take that what you will.
-Our cases went down though  -and our death rates are not commensurate with our rising hospitalization rates   https://covid19.ncdhhs.gov/dashboard    https://www.newsobserver.com/news/coronavirus/article243299221.html  >Dr. Mandy Cohen, the DHHS secretary, says the most encouraging metric has been the percentage of people who visit emergency rooms with COVID-19 symptoms. That percentage has been declining, though state officials acknowledge that overall traffic to emergency rooms has increased, perhaps as people’s fears about seeking treatment for non-COVID illnesses subsides.  If more people are going to the hospitals for non-covid illnesses, I wonder if they're admitting more "mild" cases of Covid symptoms.  Contrast with the beginning of the lockdowns, when hospitals would only take the most serious cases and symptoms, or people with milder Covid symptoms would simply stay home. You also have the people with chronic illnesses who may have Covid and they're getting treated for both.
Reason #3179 to not vote for Dan Forest.
In response to wonder if they are admitting more "mild" cases, I can tell you that at the very least the medical center I work for is not. The same screening and admittance procedures are still going on. The only thing that's changed is they've slightly relaxed visitation policy (which is still very limited)
Death rates are largely irrelevant to the true problem of Covid: get enough people sick at once and you pretty much have an economic shutdown worse than the quarantine.
Reason #1: Hospital overload

NC’s coronavirus numbers are getting worse. What can the governor do about it?

Probably not lead a protest march without a mask on closer then 6ft to everyone.
He can resign so a republican can open up the place!
I’m neutral and think that a GOP Gov. would have opened businesses up 6 weeks ago like McMaster did SC. They’re seeing tough infection spikes and we would have seen those sooner too. Now we’re seeing Memorial Day weekend revelers and will soon see protest spikes. Not a comment or judgement on any of it, just what is going to happen.
Stupid thought processes like this are why America is in the shitter.
No.
There are actually a lot of programs going on right now for folks in need. What's going to happen when we keep trucking along and have to re-shutdown come August?   What are the plans for the kids and the college students. There is literally already talks in the works because the numbers are still climbing.
No state in the USA is going to shut down again barring a complete catastrophe. The goodwill and capital used to convince people to shelter at home has been spent. People may venture out less or choose to quarantine themselves, but that's about it. The governor attending and encouraging protests where hundreds of people are crowding together for hours exerting themselves has taken away whatever credibility he had with most people.
Here’s an idea... don’t have a re-shutdown!!!  Accept it how it is.
I mean the papers being published Nature show the shut down may have saved at least 3.1 million lives in Europe and prevented up to 60 million infections in the US.   Accepting it with no changes would basically being willing to accept that life as you and I know it no longer would exist.   Cases are already back climbing with no school, no sports, no big events, and your infinite wisdom says 'fuck it, I've waited long enough, time to go back to jobs that don't exist".
Honestly I don’t give a rats a$$ how many people it’s theoretically saved. Shutting down all these important events is damaging a lot of people’s mental health including my own. Being in quarantine and not having access to therapeutic events is just as bad in my opinion. Give me liberty or give me death
>  Shutting down all these important events is damaging a lot of people’s mental health including my own.  If you think the pandemic (its not quarantine), is causing you mental health issues, there are a lot of people out there than can help you. Maybe instead of shouting nonsense on the internet you might want to talk to a therapist?   If you are saying a bar is the kind of therapy you 'need' you might really want to talk to a therapist. As for a gym, others have posted that yes, exercise is fantastic for mental health, but indoor exercise has limited mental health effects when compared to outdoor exercise.   Maybe go for a walk a few more times a week instead of sitting in front of a computer screen being angry? There are lot of things that need to be cleaned up all around, and plenty of great outdoor places for you to explore and still be able to stay safe.
100,000+ dead in the US but we should really be worried about your feelings
Oh thanks Albert Einstein I’m now cured!!!  I can take on solace how your opinion has no value or merit whatsoever. People will essentially do what they want. I hope you have a fun time being scared of your own shadow
Not necessarily mine, but the mental health of millions of other Americans

Unemployment can lead to higher suicide rates but we have a ways to go before the deaths from stay at home and economic restrictions outpace the virus
Wild idea, I know, but what if you didn't have to choose between dying of a terrible illness and losing your home?
I mean people have opened gyms and bars without the governors approval so LOL. Keep living in fantasy land
I’m sorry but with all due respect, you don’t get to dictate how people feel
Well technically I’m not in a position of government authority so you are right on that account. Objectively however one outcome is much worse than then the other

North Carolina’s hospitalizations from coronavirus continue to grow. The state hit a record high for hospitalizations Tuesday, with 774 people currently in the hospital with severe COVID-19 symptoms -- 35 more than the number reported Monday, setting a record for the fourth time in June.

To be expected. The goal is to prevent hospitals from being overwhelmed, and we're still no where close to that
Cases actually dropped dramatically yesterday.  Doesn't mean they won't go up again but it's a positive number  As of 6/9:   [https://covid19.ncdhhs.gov/dashboard/cases](https://covid19.ncdhhs.gov/dashboard/cases)
Approximately 0.000774% of the population.
So? They’re still people, 774 actually.

Cooper: More reopening 'not off table' despite NC's rising coronavirus cases :: WRAL.com

I honestly feel bad for cooper, because no matter what he does he can’t really win. :(  I hope he just helps out hospitals as much as he can.
Seems like there is lot of contradictions coming from the Governor. He's got Mandy Cohen going out with all the doom and gloom and then he says that we might move to Phase 2.5 or 3?  Seems like he's pushing the bad news delivery to Cohen.
Pernaps give hospitals what they need, open everything, impose reasonable precations, and let the at-risk or cautious (like me) continue defensive measures. The initial shutdown was to flatten a curve, not eliminate it.
Sounds like deep down inside they want to re-open more but with the rising cases it just wouldnt make sense.
Removed as a [duplicate](https://www.reddit.com/r/NorthCarolina/comments/h7vmsb/these_numbers_and_trends_are_sobering_cooper_said/)  (rule 4)
What is wrong with you, Cooper????
That's politics
The most rational response.
I think he needs to make masks a requirement (at least where ever possible) instead of just a suggestion. The amount of protection masks provide compared to the level of economic damage they inflict really makes them a no-brainer for opening up further while reducing ongoing risk.
The problem is the precautions won't be followed.  If wearing masks was made mandatory in public id say maybe 25% will follow.  Its incredible how many people out and about do not wear masks even though studies show it decreases transmission by 60 percent.  Plan for the worst, hope for the best.
I feel this is how the majority of people feel. Reddit is such a bad representation of the general public.  I'm a adult. Let adults decide what risks they want to take. I work in healthcare and have been working as if COVID never happened, but when I get off my shift i'm forced to lock myself inside my apartment and can't go or leave.  I'm an adult. Let me make adult decisions.
The other should be deleted as the title isn’t from the article.
While I do hope he is more careful about opening up than the move into Phase II was, I think if you thought about it a bit deeper than just 'cooper bad', you might see the position that he is in right now offers few good moves and at least understand why he would even consider moving forward to some degree.   The people you've supported for years are doing exactly what you voted for them to do, which is playing political games, trying to win points for November, sticking it to the libs, and protecting businesses rather than people.   Rather than working to find some common ground that might keep us safe, pass legislation to give Cooper the cover he needs to extend the lockdown, work to placate your base to get them to take this more seriously, and/or meet somewhere even close to the center with Cooper, the NC GOP are content to pass legislation that undermines his authority and is likely to be vetoed. And, of course, there is also the near complete disaster of a response that we've seen on the federal level.  Yet, true to form, the most nuanced political analysis you can come to is 'Cooper bad', while the very things you have championed and cheer-leaded for years are what are making us less safe right now.
Yes and no. From a non biased perspective there’s nothing Cooper can really do to appease the masses, whether he is a dem or rep he’s going to get flack
> We could be like New Zealand and back to full open no worry about COVID but too many people are conserved about their 'rights' to not wear a mask.  Were masks ever required in New Zealand? I know they had a very strict lock down but don't see any reference to mask rules.  But you do make a good point. The US should have attacked this problem early on like New Zealand did instead of saying its just a flu or saying the chance of anyone getting it was very low.
Which is crazy because he is a doomer. You’d think he’d like Coopers actions a lot.

Google has stopped updating coronavirus cases since June 11
Anyone know where to find the most recent data?  It had been updating every day a bit after midnight but has stopped for the last few days
[this is the official State site.](https://covid19.ncdhhs.gov/)
Yeah this is the first time I’ve noticed they stopped updating it and I follow it daily. It comes on the day of the highest single day tally which I found odd.
Maybe they don’t do it on the weekend. Also cuz reporting can take several days, daily updates may not be accurate.
Same.  I’m looking at the official website but even on the weekends they usually update it just a bit after midnight.  Hopefully nothing out of the ordinary and it all gets updated soon

Active coronavirus cases in North Carolina by county, per ArcGIS and the Johns Hopkins dashboard.
https://carolinasportsthoughts.wordpress.com/2020/06/14/active-coronavirus-cases-in-north-carolina/The number is the one listed on the ArcGIS site, which updates daily. Total cases are what’s occurred since the pandemic started.Top 5 counties: 1. Mecklenburg- 3,277 (+168)2. Wake- 1,380 (+106)3. Durham- 1,210 (+2)4. Forsyth- 1,041 (+40)5. Guilford- 942 (+65)
That Wake number is way off...  NCDHHS is showing 3011 confirmed cases as of today (as in medical test showed a positive result).  Considering the total number of confirmed cases for Wake County was 1773 back on the 1st of June we’re most definitely still way deep in this shit.
Moore County crossed 300 today. I can't speak to the other counties, but that's a long way to be off
Is there a particular reason Charlotte is getting hit harder than others? I lived there a few years( quite a while ago) and I can’t quite figure it’s vulnerability.
NCDHHS (as of this morning):  Mecklenburg: 7131  Wake: 3011  Durham: 2662  Forsyth: 2204  Guilford: 2032.   EDIT: these may be total cases rather than active
Population density?
Probably also Charlotte Douglas International Airport and the proximity to South Carolina.

Crew member who was at Ace Speedway has tested positive for coronavirus, according to report

Not to be unexpected. But we don't know where they actually got the virus from.
Or who they might’ve spread it to, with the number of people who attended the races.

North Carolina hospitals reported a new high in coronavirus cases on Tuesday. With 85% of hospitals across the state reporting, a record 829 people are in the hospital with COVID-like symptoms.

It’s almost always between 85-95% reporting, so this is on the lower end.    That’s really not good.
And the Reopen NC leader preaching about not wanting to wear a mask. [link](https://www.facebook.com/102818468089169/posts/140096531028029/?vh=e). Please be smart and wear a mask.
30 additional patients may not seem like a lot but to put it into perspective that’s the size of a large hospital’s ICU or a medical floor... most hospitals run at close to full capacity normally.... with surgeries starting back up and these additional patients, we a will run out of beds VERY quickly at this rate
Make. People. Wear. Masks.
And yet I see some of my friends post instagram stories of them at southern charred in Raleigh with no masks, and a lot of people in one room. I understand its a bar and we could all use a distraction but the numbers speak for themselves.
That's what 30 new people in a week or so? Last number I saw was just south of 800.
After the Pence snafu is anyone still using the more testing cop out or are we ready to be realistic?
I take this seriously.  But I know so many people who will not wear a mask.  They still think this is overblown.  Only old people or those with underlying conditions need to worry they say, young don't get it,  people die all the time of other things, etc., they're relatively healthy so not worrying about it, talk about all those that have recovered from it, can't wait to vote Cooper out.  And my county has a relatively low number of cases, still going up, but then it is not like all in the county have been tested, only those with symptoms or contacts.  And I don't get blaming Cooper, he is listening to our health experts, what are they for if not to listen to?
17 more in the hospital today.
Taking Covid seriously seems to be a mixed bag here in Raleigh. I’ve been in places where maybe 50% are wearing masks and other places where it’s 100%.  I went to get my car checked out and only a couple of people were wearing masks, then I went to the Teeter and it was 100% ( full disclosure, this was not on the weekend).  It’s sort of understandable that people working in the car bays wouldn’t wear a mask but I’m talking about the waiting room.
Welp, I bet coop shuts us down again.
Crazy! What's been happening in the last couple of weeks to cause this???   Hrmmmm
I think this needs to a local matter. Charlotte, Raleigh, Ashville, Winston-Salem,and the 4 other large cities I understand, but out here in the sticks those mask are about as useful as a lightbulb in an Amish house
The google statistics of covid show the graph is spiking a bit. I wonder what a month will look like.
I was in RDU this past weekend, and although people were wearing masks on the plane - literally no one was in the airport. No one seems to care or think this is real.
We're still no where close to overwhelming the healthcare system, and the increase of 30 in a week in a state of 10 million is very manageable. Don't buy in to the hype
These numbers seem inflated. The wording even says "covid-like symptoms". So it's not confirmed, actual cases (so far as we know).  Just seems odd to me, there are people who think we should've "MADE" people stay home, and then there are those who believe in freedom... (like me)... But then we have a governor who marches with protestors (good) without wearing a mask (very bad)... Hypocritical.
People have had enough of this crap..  Wear a mask if you want but you can’t force people to wear one.  Do what’s right for you.  It’s my body and it’s my right to wear a mask or not.
This is literally the only metric I’m following. I don’t understand why 100% can’t report. They have administrators specifically for this. Should be a requirement
I like the notion of masks being equivalent to seat belts. Its a little inconvenient sure but it prevents death or injury. I don't see people burning seat belts. The entitlement is mind boggling.
Dumbass catching masks on fire. Worst performative outrage I've seen yet.
1918 Spanish flu anti mask league.    https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Mask_League_of_San_Francisco
Coming from the North. It's a little lax down here. We had a policy "No shirt, no shoes, no bottoms, no mask, no service."  Should be denied service if you enter a business not wearing a mask.   Even getting takeout in some places was lax no gloves, no mask, and no plexiglass protection.  Mask in enclosed areas/places can't social distance & hand sanitizer/washing with soap are two of the most important & easiest ways to limit the spread.  Not trying to throw my Yankee knowledge in the pot. Don't get me wrong all for being independent don't want to wear a helmet or seatbelt be you. Not wearing a mask you are affecting a lot of peoples lives and their own personal freedom because you didn't wear a mask.
“#ignitefreedom”  What dunces.
I finally caved and ordered some.
He’s gonna hate it when he realizes that he has to wear shoes and a shirt to eat in a restaurant.   And this mentality of taking their health into their own hands is completely misinformed. It’s like saying, “I like to shoot my gun into the air. I’m not worried a bullet falling back and hitting me.”
We haven't seen any outbreaks tied to either the Reopen or Floyd (outdoor) protests though. Its been three weeks too
No.
And, hospitalization stays for covid average 2 to 4 weeks long last I checked. These aren't quick turn arounds on beds.
As much as I'd like to, NC, one of the states that acted quickly and boldly to shutdown, **didn't even MAKE people stay home.** Our stay-at-home order, one of the more comprehensive ones in the country, was still half baked at best, really more of a suggestion considering the number of "essential" businesses that were open. It's no accident that the US is absolutely being impacted the most by COVID, we did comparatively nothing as a nation to stop it. And people are whining because "iTs BeEn ThReE mOnThS"?!? People in Italy couldn't go fucking JOGGING!
Yup. One of my friends keeps going out in Raleigh to a brewery, a pool with friends, and house parties. No masks. And yet she keep texting me with the updates in case numbers and worrying we are all going to die. I just don't get it. People just aren't connecting the numbers to their own actions.
People getting discharged daily (or dying) and new patients added daily.  The trend is what's most important, and it's steadily rising.
Inclusive of deaths and discharges, so 30 plus whatever those amounts are.
Yeah, both testing rates and % positive are going up, which is what you hope to not see.   https://i.imgur.com/gMkVnAt.png
If school doesn't start up in the fall, people are going to be PISSED. If we have to shut down for a while to help make that happen, people are going to be PISSED.   The % of people who aren't in touch with reality is too damn high.
He might mandate that face masks be worn outside.
can't put the worms back in the can man.  Phase 2 until September is my bet.
Wrong. Idiots who won’t wear masks and won’t take this seriously will shut us down again.
Remember Phase I? That was May 8th....
We've been going up steadily for like 5 weeks.
The current numbers are a result of two weeks ago and before.  It is from Memorial Day weekend and the beginning of Phase 2.  We have another week till we see what the major protests in the state really add to it.  Don’t forget that restaurant dining rooms and additional stores opened up in the week leading up to Memorial Day.
Memorial Day
People flocking to the beaches?
Reopening phase?
I don't think that the urgency of our national moment regarding police killing people without consequences for decades can be overstated. That said, I think that protestors need to be careful, and by and large it seems like they are. Almost all are wearing masks, looks like social distancing is happening where possible. I wish that the protests were a luxury but they're not. Can't say the same about the reopen protests back in April.
ReOpEn AmErIcA!!!!
Every county has had a case. Many surrounding counties of those bigger cities have people that travel back and forth for work or shopping or vacations.   The sticks should wear masks when indoors and not able to SD. It’s there. Lots of info out there about the spikes in rural areas. It was inevitable when the rate of transmission.
Treating it as local matters without federal action has worked really well for over 115,000 people
My wife works in a Raleigh hospital and there is now an outbreak among staff. So this is becoming a problem very quickly and they are not really responding to it well as a healthcare facility.
What’s the advantage of hyping this? Mmmm? Who benefits?   Hospitals didn’t get overwhelmed because the stay at home measures worked. Less injuries from car crashes or sports or travel. It kept open beds for the truly sick from Covid or other “normal” emergencies.   I love people like you. Why did cases slow down and hospitals not get overwhelmed?  Any correlation to stay at home orders and encouraging masks and social distancing when you did go out in public?
This. Plus 9% more hospitals are reporting but number of hospitalizations only went up by 4%. That's a net decrease!
just curious, how is wearing a mask counter to your freedom?  Freedom doesn't mean you can do ANYTHING, there are tons of things in this country that we are not free to do, and they generally revolve around the health and well-being of the collective whole.
What the fuck is the advantage to making up more cases and closing the economy? How does Cooper or anyone in HHS benefit from that?  You want odd? That type of reasoning....
If you think the numbers are inflated, Google excess deaths.
>It’s my body and it’s my right  Where have I heard that argument before?
The mask doesn't protect you. It protects everyone else from you, if you're an asymptomatic carrier.
The problem is me wearing a mask helps you. You not wearing a mask fucks us. Wear a fucking mask asshole.
There are unalienable rights, and there are assumed rights. Just as you have the right to do what you want with your body, others have a right to be protected from harm by you or anyone.   I’m not saying I agree one way or another, but I do believe we have to do what we as a society must to work together and survive. The knowledge to survive and thrive is something that our leaders are trying their absolute damndest to get from professionals who have been studying events like this their entire adult careers. Yes, there is more than enough chance for bias to enter this process, but what harm is it causing you to wear something on your face for a 10-minute grocery trip?   I don’t want you to think I’m attacking you in any way, but I am curious as to why this is such an inconvenience for you. If this is something you want to discuss privately, I’m also open to do that! I really just want to understand if there is something to your side of the argument.
Supposed to be empathy, common decency, and common sense that makes you wear one. I guess a temporary order is a poor substitute for a conscience.
Oh, no...   I hope you don't live in Raleigh. You might be forced to.. \*gasp\* take other peoples' safety and wellbeing into consideration.   [https://www.wwaytv3.com/2020/06/16/raleigh-requires-face-masks-in-public-gov-cooper-considers-statewide-requirement/](https://www.wwaytv3.com/2020/06/16/raleigh-requires-face-masks-in-public-gov-cooper-considers-statewide-requirement/)
I want to start a campaign like #dicksoutforcovid because I'm pretty sure you are required by public decency and law to wear certain things every day and when you enter certain places. Unless you are willing to stand up for everyone's right to whip their dick out in public in the name of their body, their choice then it just makes you sound like a big whiny baby who doesn't want something on his face.
You anti-seatbelt too? That’s how dumb you sound.
Whether or not you wear a mask affects others. We’re trying to keep other people healthy too.
You can be forced to where a mask if you want to enter a private business.  Stop being a pussy about a medical solution to a medical problem.
It's your body and your right, huh?
You don't live in a vacuum, your bodily autonomy is not protected if it violates that of others.
I hope you apply that logic across the spectrum of political meddling.
I've been told before that some areas that have a very low pop and # of cases can't report things due to possible hippa violations because its easy to figure out who it is.  Who knows if that's true or not
I’m in the industry and let me tell you, some of these hospitals are not reporting data on time...whatsoever.
My exact same argument when getting haggled by gullibly biased fools that decide harrasing employees at work about wearing a mask they are required to wear to work. Why are these people so awful towards people they disagree with. It's like they get off on control and confuse disagree with disrespect.
Exactly. You think the seatbelt law is to protect YOU?? No way. It's to protect the first responders who have to scrape you up when you're in a wreck. It's also to protect your passengers who will be injured by your flying body. LOL
>[Some opponents argued the decision to use a seatbelt should be personal rather than legal. A letter to the Appleton Post Crescent in 1964 stated, "As long as the life risked is his own, I believe the individual should decide whether or not the use of safety belts is wise."](https://www.wpr.org/surprisingly-controversial-history-seat-belts)  Well, actually...  Unfortunately, as long as there are people there will be morons.
Perhaps not surprising, but folks were outraged against seatbelts too:  [https://www.businessinsider.com/when-americans-went-to-war-against-seat-belts-2020-5](https://www.businessinsider.com/when-americans-went-to-war-against-seat-belts-2020-5)
Costco here requires masks to enter the store. Not sure about too many other places since that's one of the few places I hit for staples.   But I agree with your assessment. I think a lot has to do with north vs south, dense urban vs rural attitudes. I think people who live in denser cities are more comfortable with the idea that their choices affect their neighbors since they are almost never more than a few feet from someone once they step outside. It's constantly top of mind.
Thing is, if a place does that, just drive 10 miles to the country, and it's not required.   Most folks will drive that 10 miles to avoid the mask.
Meanwhile it's optional at my work and my boss talked about wearing a mask like it's only a placebo to help you feel safer, he was bragging about all their safety precautions while not wearing a mask.
The cases are definitely increasing though
I’d just like to point out that you rejected not only wearing a mask, but also you rejected being smart. Just sayin’...
"I also refuse to wear a seatbelt, I mean, I don't know anyone that has died by not wearing one, so why should I wear a seatbelt?"
if you don't like people telling you what to do to protect others, do you like if they tell you to fuck off by pleasuring your self?
AND expanding into other, non-dedicated wards means you have an increase chance of exposure to other patients.
The company I work for lobbied to be considered essential because they wanted to stay open and keep making money. Now all of us have to come in or risk being fired, even when there's no work and they will never allow WFH.  Oh, or if we do stay home we have to burn through our meager vacation time (we don't have separate sick leave or anything).
Drives me crazy when people say we were under “lockdown.” No we weren’t. If we were under a true lockdown you wouldn’t have bought that grill at Lowe’s.
Well there should be less vehicles on the road for one so there should have been more resources to fine people, businesses are easier to target for non enforcement. Just like with seatbelts more people wear them when it is enforced
If people want cops to enforce mask laws, minorities would probably get the brunt of enforcement. Like what happened in NYC, when police up there were harassing folks when they were enforcing social distancing
That's not really an argument against it. Simply making a state-wide mask order will encourage a lot of people to wear masks who otherwise wouldn't.   You would also be requiring businesses to put signs up requiring mask use (much like they did/are still doing with the limited occupancy rules.
Same here. We have friends that act all concerned and informed to us then turn around and go shopping constantly or work (when they didn’t have to including getting their teenaged nanny back to watch the kids).  The mom even texted my wife about the return to school in the fall. I was thinking “oh is she worried about her kids getting sick?” but I read the texts and she says it’s not “fair for the kids” to have to wear mask and social distances “with their friends RIGHT THERE” so she might home school instead.   It’s awkward and inconvenient sure but it’s to keep them safe! Nothing less.
Exactly
To be fair, I feel like I’m not in touch with reality and I’ve being trying so fucking hard to keep up with what is going on with the virus and the world. The more I’ve learned, the less sense it all makes. I’m still wearing a mask in public and washing my hands/keep hand sanitizer with me, but no matter what I do, it feels like it’s the wrong thing.
The anger about it all has really surprised me.  I can’t believe the amount of self entitled jerks In this state.  There are new markets opening up - they need to innovate and stop bitching about their businesses.  Business itself is going to be down, might as well put energy into protecting everyone and finding your pandemic niche to bring in some cash.  So many whiners.
I don’t think it’s not being in touch with reality to be concerned about a completely devastated world economy if we don’t keep things moving. A lot of focus has been on small businesses going closing doors but as this thing drags on it’s going to be corporations that shut down...permanently. You can bash big business all you want and throw in corporate greed and say they should have the money to buy their way out of this but they don’t...and neither does the country. For many people they can’t work from home. If you are building aircraft or car components you can’t just haul a $500,000 CNC lathe to your house. Grocery stores are still stocked because the people “in charge” have decided that the minimally paid folks suppling our food at processing plants need to keep working so that those of us being FORCED to stay home have something to eat...while also being paid a bonus to stay home.  The elderly who are retired living off the stock market from their savings who can no longer afford a life based on social security pay are not losing “money” because of this COVID economy...they are losing years off their lives. They are losing money hand over fist that they have no way to recoup unless they go stand in a store as a Walmart greeter. Illness related to stress of parents trying to feed and provide for their families wondering where they are gonna find a job with 17% unemployment and even higher percentage of underemployment will be the next killer.  And suicide? We will probably never know the full toll of that.   So yeah...I’m one of the ignorant that everyone wants to rant about. And I am an “essential worker” for whatever that means and I work in the aerospace industry. We’ve worked, we’ve been laid off and we’ve come back to work again...but I’ve seen many of my friends lose their means to provide a living for their families.    I wash my hands, I cover my face when I sneeze, I wipe down the buggy handle at the store...I ALWAYS have even before COVID.   But my fear is not COVID-19 it’s the world we live in after COVID-19 if we don’t keep our economy moving.  Life may be free, but living isn’t...and it’s pretty damn elitist of you to keep preaching shutdown the country when we are ALL going to the grocery stores once a week to get food that we are forcing others to put themselves in harms way to produce for us...while you sit at home and say why doesn’t everyone just social distance and work from home.
This is the price of having an anti-education, redneck culture. Sorry, but it is.
It would be a start to mandate it INSIDE. Outside isn’t a big deal if you can social distance. It’s impossible inside. So it should be mandated. The fact that everyone is freaking out about it and it was never mandatory is a disgrace. and many states with mandatory mask rules have seen decreases as things open.
> masks be worn outside.  that's dumb though. Covid is very very hard to spread outdoors, mask or no mask. It's the indoor spaces that you have to worry about
well that's what i meant, cooper will have to because of the fucking idiots in this state.
And, NC residents flocking to SC earlier than and since NC began gradually re-opening, Memorial Day, some people refusing to care about limiting chances for infection and the potential to infect grandparents, parents, other relatives, friends, etc, massive numbers of people protesting with some (emphasis on some) never wearing a mask, etc
Covid doesn't spread outdoors like it does in cramped indoor spaces. That's why we haven't seen any outbreaks tied to the protests
I can say that after the first shockwave of protests many of the protesters began to wear masks. It doesn't make the chance non zero. I fully support them and am glad to see them wearing masks. I think no matter what some of this spread is due to the protests.  BUT I also know some of this spread is from those not taking it seriously and not wearing masks in public.  It's both. Protests have a cause. Everyone else should be ashamed.
Reopening at Memorial Day was a bigger factor than protests. And not having mandatory masks. Remember the reopen protests were long before the police brutality protests. And the reopen shills certainly were wearing less masks.
I'm sure the number of protesters out there is far smaller than the number of people going out to all of the new businesses that opened over the last few weeks.  But hey some people think sniffing their own farts as Captain Reasonable about the protests always think they're really knocking it out of the park.
Odd, because if you look at the data google has on it, the daily case delta per day recently (since the end of may) is WAYYYY higher on average than Aprils.  Maybe I'm looking at it wrong.  Or maybe cheap face coverings don't work?  Or maybe protests could take another form? Like a walkout?  What if we just practiced better hygiene?  What if all of this has been a ploy to draw particular groups of people together to cause this? Maybe you're being played.  Many more things to consider.
It was being *outside* and protesting that made all the difference. That's why we haven't seen any outbreaks tied to either the ReOpen protests over a month ago, or the more recent Floyd protests.
This is never been a local matter it's been a state matter since the word go.  The federal government has no way of controlling every little aspect of a small  community, but if you would let the Counties handle the small communities it's a lot easier to manage.
These people think it’s hyped up. Inflated.   Why? Who benefits?  Hope your wife stays safe.
Durham county has required masks for quite a while now but is doing worse than Wake, which never has.. and they're right next to each other. Not to say that wearing masks is bad, but we pretty much need the entire state to do it for it to matter.
There aren't going to be a bunch of unexpected covid patients,  that's the gist of this whole thing. The numbers are growing in a very steady and predictable fashion, so we have the time and capacity to deal with this
What’s the advantage of “hyping” this up? Who benefits?   The attack on science and doctors that study infectious disease for a fucking career and the ease that you people dismiss the data is concerning, scary and embarrassing.
Re-read what I wrote. Forcing people to stay home, regardless of the reason, is what I'm talking about in regards to your freedom.  You know how not to spread a virus, you've dealt with flu every year your entire life, so you know the risks of going out and/or socializing with others. That's YOUR choice. People are so quick to judge others who choose to live their life they way they see fit, which is ridiculous. If you're worried about this virus, then stay home, if you're not, then you decide what risks you want to take.
What's the advantage to listing corona virus as the cause of death for a long term cancer patient (whom died of Cancer, not Covid), or listing the cause of death as corona virus on a car crash victim (whom had a blood alcohol level of 0.55%!), who also didn't die from Corona virus?   You tell me why the data for listing the cause of death as corona virus is so lax? Why are they so quick to stick covid on death certificates? Why are doctors being pressured to do so? Hospitals are incentivized (financially) to pressure physicians to include COVID-19 on death certificates and discharge papers, since the CARES Act increases Medicare payments to hospitals treating COVID-19 victims. As part of the CARES Act, Congress pledged to reverse scheduled scheduled cuts in Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements, effectively spreading an additional $11 billion across 3,000 hospitals.  If you died WITH covid, but not FROM covid, it's still listed as a covid death.... Why is that? "what the fuck is the advantage" (your words).
How does that metric help? The excess death metric counts all deaths directly or indirectly related to Covid. Isn't there a ton more suicides in the past couple months from people social distancing, worrying about the daily gloom-news and/or other mental problems "associated" with Covid19?  Not being a smart ass, not sure why everyone is so quick to jump on their hate wagons (guess this covid has them stir crazy), but I truly don't see how that metric is at all usable.
You must be thinking of the #reopen people when they were protesting wanting to get a haircut. They were definitely saying it then.  I can't think of any other large group of people who have said this phrase before.  Edit: /s (didn't think I needed this)
check the post history.  dudes cruising swingers forums.  I dont think he gives two shits about folks safty
Haven’t they come out and said that asymptomatic spread is very rare?  Edit: not sure why I’m being downvoted... https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/08/asymptomatic-coronavirus-patients-arent-spreading-new-infections-who-says.html
Empathy, decency and common sense are also what’s needed to fix a lot of the shit happening right now.  Don’t hold your breath.
hell, it would piss even more people off if it was trans dicks out for covid.  or maybe gay dicks out.  I mean it seems to be a certain group that doesn't like gay / trans / masks.
Hey, if you need to start #dicksoutforcovid for the good of NC, I fully support you in your endeavors.
Drunk driving is the better metaphor
Considering they also said that 'there is no evidence that asymptomatic carriers spread the virus', I'm pretty sure there's nothing you can do.  Edit: by 'they' I mean the author of that post.. not anyone with any scientific credibility.
and folks can refuse that private business as well.   Either way you lose customers.
probably feels "no" is just a suggestion too.
That's right. Just ask smokers.
This is definitely a thing in healthcare research. I'm not sure if it is the reason behind this particular issue, but patient identifiability concerns are taken very seriously by the people who report and analyze these numbers.
You nailed the why.   Think of how little time as a customer you actually spend inside at stores. How is that such a big deal to wear one?
I can easily argue  that person is in control of a 3000 lb vehicle. Loss of control due to not wearing a seat belt can easily kill pedestrians and cause loss of life to other vehicles on the road. These people are not on some deserted island. Their argument shows how truly selfish they are, believing their actions can only hurt themselves. We all know that is not true.
Ikea Charlotte "Required" masks to enter, and by "Required" I mean "they had a sign up that they weren't enforcing".
but it's not due to more people being outdoors, such as during the protests. Which means we should move more and allow more activities outdoors. Like keeping playgrounds and other things closed doesn't make any sense, when outdoor spread is negligible
Not wearing a mask is arguably worse because it also puts other people at direct risk. From a moral view it's more like refusing to repair broken lights before driving at night because that's also dangerous for everyone else on the road
It’s closer to drunk driving than it is to not wearing a seatbelt. Refusing to wear a mask is reckless and endangers others.
My bro in So Flo (who is regrettably not named Joe) got a doctors note to continue WFH. They wanted him in office in like early May.
sorry man :/
thats humanity for you, lots of people are fine with new restrictions until it actually impacts them. San Francisco is a great example, no one wanted a homeless shelter built in THEIR neighborhood
Wearing a mask everywhere and practicing good hand hygiene is absolutely NOT the wrong thing, no matter what conflicting info you’ve seen. You’re doing a great job. Keep it up!
Why do you feel that way? Masks were never mandatory or even suggested initially. Now they are. Hand washing has been day one. You are doing all you can (in addition to social distancing) so please don’t feel it’s the wrong way. We need more people like YOU.   Your confusion is because idiots freaked out about masks when they were a strong suggestion.   IT ISN’T EVEN MANDATORY YET!  Remember, these people want their freedom and personal accountability so they actually got it (private businesses could still require it and some reopening of some businesses had a mask requirement like haircuts and nails) imagine their faux outrage when/if the state makes it mandatory in public.   Especially when the GOP majority in the NC senate is making it political and fanning the flames to trying to attack Cooper. Like it would be good for his political future to sink the economy. Shame on him for trying to save lives of his constituents.
Just don't go out unless you have to. If you have to go out, wear a mask and sanitize/wash your hands. Stay away from people. Don't do anything unnecessary.
>you sit at home and say why doesn’t everyone just social distance and work from home  Eh, you're putting words in my mouth. I'm not a doc. Somehow other countries got their s\*\*\* together and went through a few terrible months but now, no new cases! I shouldn't have to be a public health expert to say we are screwing up royal. There's a way to fix this, without sheltering in place all of 2020!
My mistake, I thought that masks inside and social distancing were mandatory during lockdown and never lifted. I still live as though we’re in lockdown so It looks like I’m not very current.
There's another theory.  It spreads outdoors less, true, but the big driver was a lot of folks stayed home due to curfews and fears.
Can’t tell if you’re being sarcastic, but that’s not the case.
Everyone is going to say its the protests driving it up unironically while eating out with friends at the fucking PACKED Texas Roadhouse.
I went to a protest last Sunday and out of everyone I walked (roughly 3000 there) by I saw like three people without masks. At the edge with some "counter-protesters" no one had them.
Guy Fawkes masks don't prevent Coronavirus transmission.
Are you a scientist?
Remember just because they are asked to social distance, wash hands more and wear masks in public doesn’t mean enough people did it.   I’ve done all of these while getting groceries and two trips to Lowes are the only times I’ve gone into a building other than my house in three months.   I’d say in total it’s been less than 50% doing the same three precautionary steps.   They’ve said from day one masks aren’t 100% that’s why it’s always been the distance part that is more crucial AND wear a mask when you can’t SD.
>  The federal government has no way of controlling every little aspect of a small  community  They absolutely do.
Agreed it isn’t just if it is mandated or not but the freaking citizens need to just suck it up and do it.
Funny, cause to me people's overreactions and fearmongering over a a virus that has a 0.3% IFR is concerning, scary and embarrassing.
Think about how pandemics work. If careless people go out and spread it, smart people who take precautions will still get it. Everyone has to go to the grocery store sometime.
Except that staying home isn’t always an option. I have conditions that could make COVID very serious for me if I contracted it but I’ve been an essential worker throughout the pandemic. A message for the “just stay at home” crowd: just wear a fucking mask. It. Will. Not. Hurt. You. And it could literally save the lives of others who don’t have the luxury of playing hermit until a vaccine is found. If living your life the way you see fit involves recklessly endangering innocent people you deserve to be judged.
I knew I would weed out which conspiracy theory you are pushing! This one has been around for awhile and is total BS.   They do get money for COVID admissions mainly to offset the amount of empty beds due to a decrease or halt of elective and minor procedures. Many hospitals are laying off staff and reducing hours and are in financial difficulties because of this. So the exact opposite of this “the hospitals are getting rich” nonsense.  https://www.factcheck.org/2020/04/social-media-posts-make-baseless-claim-on-covid-19-death-toll/  “CDC offers guidance to public health officials on the certification of COVID-19 deaths. The latest guidance was issued April 2.   “If COVID–19 played a role in the death, this condition should be specified on the death certificate. In many cases, it is likely that it will be the [underlying cause of death], as it can lead to various life-threatening conditions, such as pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS),” the guidance says. “In these cases, COVID-19 should be reported on the lowest line used in Part I with the other conditions to which it gave rise listed on the lines above it.”  The CDC advises that officials should report deaths in which the patient tested positive for COVID-19 — or, if a test isn’t available, “if the circumstances are compelling within a reasonable degree of certainty.” It further indicates that if a “definitive diagnosis cannot be made … but it is suspected or likely … it is acceptable to report COVID-19 on a death certificate as ‘probable’ or ‘presumed.'”
If there are a ton more suicides, you should be able to link the stats.   &#x200B;  The point is, people claiming the numbers are inflated are completely wrong: it's exactly the opposite.
L O L
But presymptomatic spread is not rare.
They have since clarified that statement.   "The CDC also estimates that 40% of coronavirus transmission is occurring before people feel sick, meaning they are presymptomatic"  https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/09/health/who-coronavirus-asymptomatic-spread-bn/index.html  WHO is fucking terrible at science communication.
They're also gaining customers by protecting their customers.
Thanks for the insight both of you. Another record high today. Joy.
I mean, I agree, but in NC it was legal until very recently to have only one working taillight. There was even a case that made it to the SCOTUS because of it.
Yeah, lots of places are opening back up way too early because people are protesting the quarantine orders (which is nowhere near as legitimate as the BLM protests) and putting pressure on the local governments. It's ridiculous.
Who? You look at Western Europe and they continue to have new cases. New Zealand comes closest but is also a tiny population far from most other countries and scattered across a number of islands
I’ve been doing that way personally, too, but as the majority of the population is proving they can’t take the personal responsibility role on themselves so it really needs to be a mandate.
>  but that’s not the case.  You care to elaborate? I can provide my sources to my assertions:  Cases dropping in New York and Minnesota, home to *bigger* outdoor protests than ours:  https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/hahtuu/new_york_reports_lowest_new_case_tally_since/  https://www.reddit.com/r/minnesota/comments/h9j6pj/covid19_update_up_222_230_by_mdh_active_2780/  https://komonews.com/news/local/fewer-than-1-of-seattle-protesters-test-positive-for-coronavirus  https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/h8zlox/early_test_results_show_few_protesters_caught/  Sources for lack of outdoor spread:  [Transmission of the coronavirus is 20x lower in outdoor settings, viral load lower as well](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/gs6bjy/transmission_of_the_coronavirus_is_20x_lower_in/)   [Small droplet aerosols in poorly ventilated spaces and SARS-CoV-2 transmission](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/gs4eqw/small_droplet_aerosols_in_poorly_ventilated/)
I’m curious what your point here is. Care to elaborate?
That is quite clearly an oxygen deprived squid.
I agree that Trump could and should have set a better example but most of the powers to combat the Virus are very much a state’s responsibility. Trump can use the power of the pulpit and the purse but its largely not a ton the Feds can directly do
POTUS wanted to close down travel to and from the effected areas but the dems fought him on it and are wanting to re-open it with this next "stimulus bill" they don't give 2 shits about us we are nothing but pawns in their political bullshit.
Stay at home orders and the like are not a power of the Federal government
They don't have the manpower to do that and its unconstitutional. I hate to say it but the liberal media has more control over this country than anything
Right because the *only* bad thing that can happen is it kills you...
Again, I'm not saying anything related to masks. Hell, I think we should've been wearing masks (out of pure courtesy) every single Flu season, think of all the deaths from the flu that could've been prevented.
So, the forced to stay at home, is in response to another redditors comment complaining the the governor didn't force people to stay at home (it's somewhere in this thread).  As for your other, weird questions about firing black people and burning down houses. I'm not sure why your brain is going there. But yes, you COULD do all those things, and you'd pay the consequences in doing so. Just like going out during the pandemic. You know the risks, you make the choice. That's all I'm saying.
Not a conspiracy theory, work for a hospital, we legit get more money if it says Covid on the death certificate, it doesn't even have to be the cause of death, just as a "factor" and on the cert.   Why do liberals always say something about Fox? I don't watch Fox, but I do notice the only people who mention it are liberals. It's a really weird argument "Do you watch the number highest rated cable news channel?". What is that argument trying to prove? Very strange you liberals are.  Never did I say the docs are "killing people purposely", you're being ridiculous. It's funny you're relying on the CDC's data, the same CDC who originally said the death rate would be upwards of 7%, when it's only 0.5% (ever less so if under age of 70), but ok bud, whatever you say. If you want to keep drinking the kool-aid, then go right ahead.
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/19/health/pandemic-coronavirus-suicide-health.html
Here is an interesting article for the bay area: [https://abc7news.com/suicide-covid-19-coronavirus-rates-during-pandemic-death-by/6201962/](https://abc7news.com/suicide-covid-19-coronavirus-rates-during-pandemic-death-by/6201962/)  It will be a while before any real statistics are available.  So, anecdotal is the best you could hope for now.  That article paints a pretty bleak picture.  *" Doctors at John Muir Medical Center in Walnut Creek say they have seen  more deaths by suicide during this quarantine period than deaths from  the* [*COVID-19 virus.*](https://abc7news.com/coronavirus) *"*     *"We've never seen numbers like this, in such a short period of  time," he said. "I mean we've seen a year's worth of suicide attempts in  the last four weeks."*
Unfortunately scientists and marketing gurus don't often cross paths
Oh, no, you misunderstand. I did not word that correctly.   Asymptomatic and presymptomatic carriers can absolutely spread the virus and have been responsible for no less than 40% of infections.   What I was pointing out is that the person who posted about not wanting to wear a mask has been posting that they don't believe you can catch the virus from people not showing symptoms... and people who refuse to believe the science are hard to convince of other things – like wearing a mask.
Yeah, this is not looking good for the state. On a brighter note, I'm always happy to provide insight into healthcare/public health research. The more people that understand what goes into it and how much the researchers care about their work, the more people that will adhere to and help spread recommendations the next time something like this comes around.
actually it was one working brake light.  not tail light.  There's a difference   Any motor vehicle, motorcycle, or motor-driven cycle manufactured after December 31, 1955 that is operated on street or highway in North Carolina must be “equipped with a stop lamp on the rear of the vehicle.” The stop lamp must display a red or amber light visible from at least 100 feet to the rear in normal sunlight.  Also I never heard that they updated the law.  The problem comes from some cars sharing tail lights and brake lights (not all do).  The Supreme Court decided that the cop was acting in good faith when stopping the car, because a court hadn't ruled previously that brake lights and tail lights aren't the same thing, and it was a reasonable thing for the police to not know the law saw them differently.  edit : never mind, found it https://charlottedwiattorney.com/change-in-brake-light-law/
And many PDs in the state no longer allow cops to enforce the law because it was used to harass minorities. Greensboro in particular.
They'll become openly defiant instead, and mask usage will go down, not up, especially in rural areas, and folks will start doing their shopping more in rural areas or South Carolina to get around it.  I think you can work on the margins, keep encouraging, maybe make mandatory on state-owned places like the universities (this is happening), but if you try to force on an unwilling population that already hates you, it will create a powder keg.  You shouldn't throw things out you're unwilling or unable to enforce.  Virginia did what Cooper is suggesting, folks got more defiant there and mask usage hasn't gone up there.
Transmission is less, but it’s not to fair to say that it doesn’t spread when you’re outdoors.
You got a source on that?  Because from what I can see the only people who pushed back against the idea of a travel ban were [the WHO and health experts](https://www.statnews.com/2020/01/31/as-far-right-calls-for-china-travel-ban-health-experts-warn-coronavirus-response-would-suffer/) who don't really believe that travel bans are effective at stemming the rate of spread.  Which, incidentally, is [exactly the same thing they said with Ebola](https://blogs.cdc.gov/global/2014/10/13/cdc-director-why-i-dont-support-a-travel-ban-to-combat-ebola-outbreak/).  It sounds to me like you're conflating [Trump's immigration travel ban](https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/31/politics/trump-administration-travel-ban-six-new-countries/index.html) with the coronavirus travel ban, because news coverage was going on at the same time.  Democrats *did* push back against *that* ban, but mainly because it's nonsensical security theater meant to pander to his base.  I've found no evidence that Democrats pushed back against the coronavirus travel ban.
So no source?
lol
so, unclear, but certainly in line with or higher than modern hellworld. and the article isn't about social distancing, its about the pandemic. which would've been prevented by a national plan.
>it was a reasonable thing for the police to not know the law saw them differently  Maybe it should be reasonable for the police to KNOW THE ACTUAL FUCKING LAW.
I wish I could understand this but I don’t. It’s uncomfortable, no denying that, but it’s helping everyone around you stay healthy. Depending upon what you read it may help you a little or a lot.   Does it make sense that people would willing put others at risk just because it’s uncomfortable?
He ignored my response that confirmed his argument to you that they DO get money for a COVID patients and for good, valid reasons. It just has no correlation with the rest of his nonsense.   The creator of this theory simply saw the fact that they get “more” for COVID and then completely ignored the rest of the facts.
I don't disagree, I was just paraphrasing the judgment.   Although if I knew the laws that well I'd probably be a lawyer or legislator instead of a cop.
They feel there's little to no risk, and there's also the real deep issue.  Most of them are worried this will become permanent, a new normal, and they don't feel it's worth living with masks, they actually would rather just take their chances.    Gotta remember for a lot of these folks they don't think really think their life is worth living all that much.
That wasn't meant to be on you, I just felt it needed to be said in general.
I think I understand the concern/fear that compliance may become permanent but that last sentence broke my heart :(

In one North Carolina hospital, coronavirus outbreak feels like it’s just beginning

>When coronavirus emerged in the United States this winter, hospitals in North Carolina prepared for a sharp increase in patients sickened with the respiratory illness. They feared a surge in patients could fill emergency rooms and intensive care units as it had in places such as Italy and New York.  >Public health and hospital officials say the statewide stay-at-home order and other steps to keep people physically apart worked to “flatten the curve,” to prevent a sharp spike in COVID-19 cases. But the virus hasn’t gone away, and North Carolina is in the midst of a slower but steady surge of COVID-19 cases, said Dr. Shannon Carson, chief of pulmonary diseases and critical care medicine at UNC.  -So it looks like our initial lock downs did prepare our hospitals for the now ongoing rise in cases.   -Not to play down what's happening, but there's nothing in this article that indicates our hospitals are not prepared now for what's happening. Contrast with what they were saying a couple of months ago
Did the News and Observer drop their free corona virus coverage?
Except the part: > ... this weekend UNC Medical Center in Chapel Hill filled all 22 beds currently set aside for COVID-19 patients in its medical intensive care unit, before slipping back down to 20 this week  That's the worry. When beds are full, any additional patients, especially in an ICU setting become triaged. That means the docs suddenly have to make the decisions of who gets 100% care, and who gets less care.   In counties and areas without such preparations (say Dare county and many other hospitals in NC without ICUs) those patients will have to be placed somewhere else.   As the article states, while they have had time to prep for COVID, the best prevention would be to not need those beds to begin with.
We have one million beds total in America.     That's it - one million total beds. Every cancer ward, birthing ward, ICU bed, PICU bed - all of em. One million.     So far - the "it'll all be fine" folks have been right about exactly zero.
But they didn't say their beds were full. They said that all beds specifically reserved for COVID were full, but aren't anymore. They still have other ICU beds.
No, it means they would use beds not specifically reserved for COVID. Agreed that everyone should start wearing masks.
Yes, which means the chance of exposure in non-isolated wards increases.

Coronavirus Cases in U.S. - Evolution of 15 States with more Cases - From 1 March to 16 June

Don't call it a come back

North Carolina sets another one-day high in reported coronavirus hospitalizations

Make. NC. Wear. Facemasks.  California is already doing it.  If you want things to open, this is the way.
I felt like almost all non-maskers are wearing MAGA hat lol. Any correlation with their political belief?
Because "mah freedoms" or some other nonsense like that.  The virus doesn't personally affect them or anyone close to them, so therefore it isn't a viable risk nor do they consider it a remote threat. It somehow, inexplicably, doesn't exist to them. Therefore, they don't need a mask or to adhere to any guidelines.  People took the lifting of restrictions and insisted upon going back to "normal". Now comes a price to pay; the piper always comes, no matter how morbid or melancholy the cost.  This trend is worrisome and we're going to end up another hotspot like NY if we aren't careful.   The amount of selfishness on display here tells me that if ever a pandemic arises with a severity and mortality rate far higher than Covid, we're all dead or infected.  In a fictional reference, people wonder how an asymptomatic virus that reanimated the dead(unless bitten, in which case symptomatic beforehand of whatever) could overwhelm society or be a "Wildfire" virus. The answers lies simply by viewing the actions of others we see happening now.
It's (hospitalizations) about a 1% increase over the previous day, and 67% up from a month ago.  -From (6/18) the NC DHHS FB page:  >Today’s numbers show yet another high day with more than 1,300 new cases, percent of positive tests at 9% and statewide hospitalizations at 857  I think we're down from 10 percent (positive test rate) as of 6/13:  https://spectrumlocalnews.com/nc/triangle-sandhills/news/2020/06/13/n-c--pleads-for-public-s-help-to-stop-covid-19-spike  >North Carolina recorded 1,768 COVID-19 cases, matched its 10 percent high of tests coming back positive and saw a small dip in hospitalizations after four straight days of record numbers.
I would be curious to know the ages of the hospitalizations. I saw in Texas that about a quarter of the people there hospitalized for COVID were in their 20s.
Why are People so reluctant to wear masks ???
Lol. Conservatives might make a bigger deal about it but drive around a large metro area and it becomes obvious very quickly its bipartisan dumbness
Yes.   [https://i.imgur.com/DPmGzmf.png](https://i.imgur.com/DPmGzmf.png)
In the Winston-Salem Journal today, it was published that 7.6% of hospitalizations in Forsyth County did not have underlying conditions, but did not publish age data.
The [Weekly COVID-19 Surveillance Report](https://files.nc.gov/covid/documents/dashboard/Weekly-COVID19-Surveillance.pdf) contains that information on page 6. I wish they'd report the actual numbers instead of a hard to read line chart though.
Because people are selfish. It’s a minor inconvenience and Fox News has told them that it’s an infringement on their liberties.
"I think people should make their own informed decision" is usually the reason, and it's by the same people that think that "doing their own research" (by clicking around on facebook until they find an article from who knows where that confirms their previously held belief that masks are dumb) is just as viable as thousands of scientists and virologists doing actual research which points to "wear the goddamn mask, you moron."
The same reason why people don't wear seat-belts, they're fucking dumb. They don't like "being told what to do".  Also, Joe Rogan said it you look like a pussy if you wear a mask.
Politics.
Here's a non Fox News take against masks:  I was over worked and underpaid BEFORE coronavirus hit. Now I have to do even more labor (constant sanitization), while wearing a mask that makes me overheat and feel light headed with even the slightest physical exertion.   It's fucked up and we should have just stayed closed. I was being paid twice as much to stay home.  We could have just stayed closed but the one thing capitalist society will NEVER do is tell landlords and banks to stop collecting rent.
One may not cause the other but we can pretty sure infer a common cause for both outcomes.
Thanks! Interesting that now the 24-75 group has more hospitalizations than 75+.
Those asymptomatic positive percentages are frightening
Unreal ... since when did joe rogan become an expert on infectious disease!?
That's like looking at 3/4s of the population vs less than 10 percent. Of course a wider age gap is going to have more hospitalizations than the smaller one. Especially when you consider US life expectancy is ~78 normally.
...or Bill Gates, am I right?
That’s not what I was trying to say. If you look at all the previous weeks, the 75+ age category had the highest number of hospitalizations most of the time. The most recent week, 24-49 and 50-69 both had higher numbers than 75+.   It’s the change in ranking not absolute numbers that is interesting.
Bill Gates runs a foundation that focuses on infectious diseases, so I think he would know a little more than the average person.

For 3rd straight day, 5th day in a week, NC reaches record for coronavirus hospitalizations

Yet somehow offices are reopening and bars in Charlotte are slammed...
I'm starting to think there will be another stay at home order this fall/winter if not sooner.
Uh, yes, and that's going to continue, because we are state of stupid people, who think and do stupid things, and desperate people, who are trapped in poverty, forced to undertake dangerous work, just to keep themselves fed and housed. Be ashamed north carolinians, WE are a failure.
It makes sense reading through the article. Most people becoming infected are younger people:  >Also according to North Carolina's numbers, almost half of all people with coronavirus in the state, 45%, are between 25 and 49. Twenty percent are 24 and under, but people in that age group make up zero percent of all deaths.  The good thing (if a good thing could be said), is that NC is figuring out for the moment how to keep the numbers more limited in nursing homes and other elderly care centers:  > Just 7% of people with the virus are over 75, but more than 70% of state deaths are in that age group.  > Over the past seven days, an average of 16 people per day have lost their lives, and a total 1,225 North Carolinians have died so far.  Even those cases are going up, and hospitalizations are going up, for now it seems the cases are not hitting elderly people as badly as it was before SAH orders were put in place, which may explain the flat average death rate.   It's still concerning though that all the numbers are going up and death rates are flat instead of going down.
I don't think that will happen, but Cooper will push for mandatory mask usage though. After the various protests, he doesn't have the political capital to push for shutdowns, but he does have it for masks though.
Might I show you this graph of the [Spanish Flu](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ETKvjEvXYAA2vIn.jpg)
That is somewhat reassuring. Definitely not ideal, but it seems like the measures we put in place are making a difference.
I'm really curious about the ages of the hospitalized though and if the death rate by age will also start changing with more and more young people being infected. Especially as the virus is now hitting rural areas instead of mostly just urban, as rural areas have higher obesity rates (which looks to be a risk factor in and of itself, but also leads to the other underlying health conditions that raise mortality rates).   Two pieces of news make me worry about that. First that in all age groups, people with underlying health conditions were 6x as likely to be hospitalized and 12x as likely to die than those who had none. Second, 1/4 of all hospitalized COVID cases in Texas right now are in their 20s, so young people being infected in high numbers doesn't necessarily prevent hospitalizations in large numbers.
Younger people are starting to die, the two most recent deaths in cabarrus county were 40 and 23 (it was just in the observer yesterday).  It takes time to die, you'll see those numbers go up
He may not have to. It probably will end up like before the first SAH order, where cities/counties made SAH orders.   If it ends up that there is no in-person school or some half assed effort for schooling and a big city like Charlotte enacts a SAH order, it would be pretty massive.   I do agree though, that at this point and especially in an election year, Cooper himself won't have the political capital; along with having the NCGA controlled by the GOP that wan'ts to get things going no matter what the outcomes are.
Just saw this   https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/18/politics/anthony-fauci-coronavirus-anti-science-bias/index.html
Theres a difference between being anti science and not trusting shoddy science. You cant just slap science on the words of a glorified astrologer and make them true.
Proving a point.

Antibody study shows more people infected with coronavirus in NC than numbers show :: WRAL.com

Not too much data has been released from this, but here is what WFU has public facing:   https://www.wakehealth.edu/Coronavirus/COVID-19-Community-Research-Partnership/Updates-and-Data  It's difficult to make any real assessments with the low number of patients enrolled in the study, and the high false positive rate of the antibody test.   https://www.discovermagazine.com/health/covid-19-antibody-testing-tougher-than-true-false  Unfortunately all that can be taken from this study so far is that we still don't have enough information and need to keep wearing masks, as the doc says.   If the population is truly only 8% positive, we are a long way from the 80%+ needed for any sort of 'herd' immunity.
Especially in New Hanover county. My wife works in the medical field directly with the doctors overseeing the covid19 cases. It's bad. It's a LOT worse than our 'official numbers' imply. And this is on confirmed cases and deaths alone. The unanimous agreement in the medical community is it's going to get much worse.
It's going to be like that everywhere most people had it but didn't even know they had it .
Hearing Arizona has twice the positives NC does- they're already at 20%.
>"We are getting very good evidence that most people who get infected are asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic," Sanders said. "Some of these people are feeling it a little bit – a scratchy throat, a little cough – but most of the people in our study had very few symptoms."  >“The vast majority of people that we’ve tested for antibodies, that have been positive, have had no or very little symptoms,” Sanders said.  >"We can say that 10 to 20 times the number of people who have an identified case have antibodies to the infection," he said.   Whoa boy. There's quite a few chicken littles here in this sub that are about to realize the sky wasn't fallin'.
lmao citation needed
So if you believe the data from the article. 1.05 million people in N.C. have had the virus. (~10% positive with Antibodies per the WRAL article).
Okay, let's go with the high estimate:  >20 times the number of people who have an identified case have antibodies to the infection  How many people have an identified case? Approximately 2.2 million in the US. So if we believe that statement that means approx 44 million have been infected. If we treat that as gospel and extrapolate the numbers to the remaining US population (284 million), that means approx 750,000 will die due to COVID-19.  To put this in perspective the number 1 leading cause of death in the US is Heart Disease at 647,457, then Cancer at 599,108.  If left unchecked COVID-19 will literally be the leading cause of death for Americans in 2020. Just imagine if you could save three quarters of a millions lives by simply wearing a mask and washing your hands and keeping socially distanced, only for a few months.  I'd argue that the person refusing to wear a mask is the true chicken little. They're scared to be judged by their peers, they're scared of looking weak, they're scared of conforming, they're scared of caring.
Common sense and the way viruses spread.
Not quite.   News stories are quite misleading (journalists are not often scientists).  From the Wake Forest study:  > So far, about 5,000 people have been tested, and only about 0.4 percent had been identified by public health officials as having been infected, Sanders said.  > While it is unknown how infectious asymptomatic people are, he said people should double down on their social distancing efforts.  Quite important takeaways.   > “I’m not making any suggestion to the governor about what needs to be open or closing, but I am making a great plea to everybody that we take a lot of care of each other," he said. "We need to stay 6 feet apart. We need to wear masks. We need to stay away from our elders."  So no, its not 10%, its whatever extrapolation they are making based on those who are tested, along with the areas they are getting people from. Say if the data is starting to roll in from blood donation centers, that's not a random sample set, that's people who might have had the disease and are curious.   Back in April when WFU put out their first results indicating up to 2% of the population they had tested, they cautioned that the largest cohort of those people were at risk (high proportion of nurses and care givers).   I would strongly caution anyone and everyone not to listen to what /u/pyretic87 is saying, feel free to read the article and other science papers about the topic.   The data is still rushing out, and there has been many many retractions.   At the end of the day Dr. Sanders is correct, we need to be doubling down our social distancing efforts, wearing masks, and protecting each other and especially the elderly.   This information hasn't changed.
I don't know where you got your numbers but here are mine. [From the NC DHHS.](https://covid19.ncdhhs.gov/dashboard)  Confirmed cases: 48,188  Deaths: 1,175  Death Rate: 2.43%  Now if we add in the researcher's prediction that the cases are 10-20x higher.  (I used the lower estimate of 10x)  Estimated cases: 481,880  Deaths: 1,175  Estimated Death Rate:  0.243%  So now we want to extrapolate those numbers out to the full US population.  (I don't know where your figure of 284 Million came from but the here's the population clock from [census.gov](https://census.gov) 329,817,021)  Total Population: 329,817,021  Confirmed Cases: 2,155,572 ([from the CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html))  Deaths: 117,632  Death Rate: 5.45%  So if we use the estimated 10x higher infected rate.  Estimated Cases: 21,555,720  Deaths: 117,632  Estimated Death Rate: 0.545%  But we can't solely just apply this 0.545% to the entire population of the US. We have to look closer at additional data. Catching Covid alone is not the single factor.  Looking back to the NC cases we have this article:  [https://www.newsobserver.com/news/local/article243628127.html](https://www.newsobserver.com/news/local/article243628127.html)  >The demographic data assembled by DHHS underscores what has been said by health officials about the effects of the virus on older and more vulnerable populations.   >   >Of the confirmed positive cases reported in the state, **65 percent have been for those age 49 or younger.** Of the deaths reported, **95 percent have been for those 50 and older.**   >   >The most recent DHHS congregate living report, released Tuesday, showed there have been **605 deaths in nursing homes and 99 in residential care facilities.**  So if we look at this information we learn a considerable amount of information. **95% of the deaths are 50 and older** THAT'S MASSIVE.  704 of our deaths have come directly from nursing home or care facilities. That's 59.9% of all NC Covid deaths. So turns out if your under the age of 50 and don't have any serious underlying conditions you are vastly more likely to survive Covid. In fact if you factor in the 10-20x estimate you are likely to survive with no lingering damage. (or perhaps not even know you were infected.)  In order to extrapolate the numbers out we would need data concerning the US Population over 50. We would need the data to calculate the death rate for those over 50. And I am unwilling to go looking for those numbers. You can feel free though.  And here come more downvotes.
lmao ok
>News stories are quite misleading (journalists are not often scientists).  Breaking the embargo again..   Everything I quoted are direct quotes from the scientist not the journalist's interpretation.
>In order to extrapolate the numbers out we would need data concerning the US Population over 50.  Not necessary. If we assume the entire population is infected we would expect to the CFR remain approximately the same. That's the magic of stats when looking at large populations. We're seeing a CFR of X over a huge population, it stands to reason that X would hold true as it expands.  Actually, I would argue it gets worse because if we all go maskless then the infection rate spikes and hospitals are saturated. The reason people have a reasonable chance of survival right now is because they're not stacked neck deep in the parking lot fighting for air.  >704 of our deaths have come directly from nursing home or care facilities.  What's you're point? That the elderly are disposable? Is that really a justificaiton for not wearing a mask? Sorry grandma but I'm not likely to have any adverse effects from COVID-19 so I'm not going to even try to prevent spreading it. Sucks to be you! LOL  >And here come more downvotes.  Well, I didn't downvote you but you're quick to cry about it. Literally refreshing the page to see your karma? Anything for that sweet sweet karma I guess.
You put your spin on singular quotes and forgot to include the actual advice of the doctor:  > “I’m not making any suggestion to the governor about what needs to be open or closing, but I am making a great plea to everybody that we take a lot of care of each other," he said. "We need to stay 6 feet apart. We need to wear masks. We need to stay away from our elders."  I wonder why you would miss that point?  And yes, it's a bit sensationalized. Only 17,000 people from around the Piedmont have been tested, and they are not a random sample (you sign up to be tested). With the low of a sample size, you run into false positive errors from the antibody test.   But you already knew all that right?   No way would you come on the internet and call people 'chicken little' would you?
It was bold predictions of millions of deaths and bodies rotting in stairwells that lead us to the panic in the first place.
>What's you're point? That the elderly are disposable?  No the point is that if you aren't in the high risk population you are likely to be fine. And instead of absolutely destroying our economy and putting millions out of work is not a great response, when instead it would be far more prudent to isolate and protect at risk individuals.
By the time we get to herd immunity, it's 1 mil dead minimum.  Odds are when deaths pile up in the fall, you'll have a hard time getting a lot of folks to go out at all, which extends the period before herd immunity even longer.
Well, it would have been more prudent for the moron in the Whitehouse to have done something in November or December instead of waiting until March to pass off all responsibility to the governors.  I'm all for protecting the most at risk individuals (we're all at risk after all.) Tight restrictions on care facilities, mandatory masks in businesses, strict social distancing, incentives for businesses to let employees WFH, etc. None of these things are devastating to the economy yet anyone that supports them is a "chicken little."
There's some numbers and data in the articles. It's a state funded test so I imagine those numbers will be released. Though it is medical data so it has to be scrubbed of any identifying data. The data may be available elsewhere but I would've imagined that WRAL would have linked to it.     I literally typed Wake Forest Antibody Study into google and got this.      [https://www.wakehealth.edu/Coronavirus/COVID-19-Community-Research-Partnership/Updates-and-Data](https://www.wakehealth.edu/Coronavirus/COVID-19-Community-Research-Partnership/Updates-and-Data)      Study Enrollment:  17,825      Positive Antibody Tests:  8-10%
We get it Orange Man Bad...  &#x200B;  >Well, it would have been more prudent for the moron in the Whitehouse to have done something in November or December instead of waiting until March to pass off all responsibility to the governors.  He closed the borders in January. At the time he was called racist and xenophobic for it...  &#x200B;  >I'm all for protecting the most at risk individuals (we're all at risk after all.) Tight restrictions on care facilities, mandatory masks in businesses, strict social distancing, incentives for businesses to let employees WFH, etc.   He's not a king, the President doesn't have the power to dictate to States the way you are alleging. There are far more limits on the powers of the President than on Governors.
>We get it Orange Man Bad...  Did I hurt your feelings or something? It's very clear that the President dropped the ball on this. He could have done something in November but didn't.   >He closed the borders in January  Wrong. His first action was at the end of January when he limited travel to China. He did nothing for the entire month of February. So it wasn't until March when Trump said declared he wasn't a postal boy, and for governors to fight for supplies themselves.  >At the time he was called racist and xenophobic for it...  Oh, that's the person we want leading the country. Someone that's prepared to let hundreds of thousands of Americans die because he's afraid of criticism. LOL  >the President doesn't have the power to dictate to States  The President has the ability to lead a coordinated effort during a national crisis. Instead he abdicated responsiblity then played political favorites with the governors while peoples lives were on the line.  He's a shitty person and a shitty president.  But here you are, refusing to support mandatory masks even though it won't hurt the economy. You're too busy licking the Orange Popsicle to at least acknowledge that point (but I suspect you're doing that intentionally because it's a damn good point).
I imagine you can probably find the answers to your questions if you look.
I can't wait for 2024 when the NPCs can no longer blame Trump for everything. But I'm sure they'll make excuses saying how it's his lingering actions or some shit.
Looks like I was right. LOL

NC reports highest coronavirus hospitalizations, 2nd-highest number of new cases

My neighbor is a nurse at the local hospital in NC. They mentioned that although there’s a good number of covid hospitalizations, the overwhelming majority are discharged within 24-36 hours. They’re chalking it up to people being less scared to go to the hospital now. Nowhere in this wral article did it mention the length of the average stay, so it’s important to not assume that just because hospitalizations are up, it means a 2-3 week stay and near death experience.
What part of the state is experiencing a spike in cases?
We plateaued for a little bit, but we never actually made all that much progress as far as *reducing*.  So technically, this isn't evidence of a second "wave". It's been the same "wave" all along. Which makes things worse rather than better when viewed as a whole, but welcome to 2020 I guess.  We'll have to wait for a bit to see what happens as far as people dying, since that indicator lags.
Are we on the verge of a second wave of coronavirus infections? Is there a spike in infections in states that reopened first?  The only way to answer that question is to watch as the data roll in. Arguably the best data to look at to see if a second wave is beginning are the hospitalization numbers. The media frequently reports the biggest and most dramatic numbers, often devoid of context. The number of cases has been reported regularly since the early days of the pandemic, and yet we know that the number of cases can be misleading.  As more people are tested and re-tested for the virus, more results will come back positive, with the current number of confirmed cases exceeding 2 million in the U.S. But if we know anything, it is that increases in the number of confirmed cases do not accurately convey how quickly and widely the virus is spreading. Antibody tests and even the examination of sewage in some cities suggest that the number of infections is likely much higher than the number of confirmed cases.   But on the other side, some of the confirmed cases are double-counted in some states partly because both antibody and active virus tests are being counted separately but then combined in the total number of cases. While the antibody tests have been criticized for their false positive rate, another criticism has been that the antibody studies can underreport infection rates because they are not sensitive enough to detect a past mild infection.  Overall, because the bulk of testing is focused on people who are the sickest and who face the greatest exposure, it seems reasonable to conclude that the true number of U.S. infections is substantially higher than the reported figure. But an attempt to estimate the true number of infections would be little better than a guess.  And this presents a problem with the daily updates. To say that a particular state or city is seeing a “spike” in cases is to say that recently they have had an uptick in positive test results. That could be due to more testing and more ways of testing, or it could be a hint of growth in the infection rate. Better Data are Available  Rather than focus on test results, i.e. “cases,” it would make more sense to focus on how the virus affects society and our institutions, particularly the strain the virus puts on health care facilities and health care providers. An obvious measure, tracked since the beginning of the pandemic, is the number of deaths. As I and others at AIER have noted, the number of deaths is hard to interpret without important context.   The coronavirus is obviously deadly, but how deadly it is seems to depend greatly on how it enters a population and the characteristics of that population. The virus has been far deadlier in New York than it has been in California, and has been most deadly in U.S. long-term care facilities. Among children, the coronavirus is considerably less deadly than seasonal influenza.  Nonetheless, deaths tell us something important about the virus’s impact on society. They profoundly affect entire social networks and are rightly emphasized in pandemic reporting.   When it comes to seeing how things are going now, whether the pandemic is growing worse or fading, deaths are a lagging indicator. They do not begin to spike until infections have already been accelerating rapidly for many days, and they do not decline until well after the virus’s spread has slowed.   The chart below shows that overall, deaths are clearly declining, although there is a weekly cycle where Sundays seem to result in relatively low death counts and Tuesdays and Wednesdays usually have the highest reported numbers. Overall, the past two weeks have had lower death totals than have been seen in the two months prior. But if a second wave were coming soon, we would not see the deaths from it yet.  Here is another look from the Washington Post.   In addition to deaths, more attention has shifted to measuring coronavirus-related hospitalizations. Frustratingly, these data tend not to go back as far as numbers on confirmed cases or deaths, but in most states there are hospitalization figures going back over two months. The hospital data are measured two ways, the first being a cumulative measure, similar to the way confirmed cases and deaths are measured.   The number can only go up as more hospitalizations are added to the total. From that number, the daily number of hospitalizations can be plotted; however that number is very noisy because the numbers are submitted at the state level in a variety of ways and do not seem to reflect the true numbers per day.  In other words, the hospitalization numbers seem to come in in clumps. They can be reported as weekly totals or weekly averages, as well. But a weakness of the cumulative data is that they do not tell us much about the burden on hospitals and health care workers. The total number of coronavirus hospitalizations increased dramatically, from zero to nearly 60,000 in a month nationally, and stayed high for weeks afterward. The chart below shows that the decrease in hospitalization has been fairly steady, and overall there is far less strain on the health care system than there was in mid-April.  The northeastern U.S. was hit hardest, but most states are either seeing declining or flat trends in hospitalizations, with a few notable exceptions such as North Carolina, Texas, and Arizona. But in those states the number of hospitalizations is still relatively low, a fraction of the totals that New York and New Jersey were seeing in April. Claims that Alabama, Georgia, and Florida are emerging “hotspots” are not supported by the hospitalization numbers despite media reports to the contrary.  There are some parts of the country still in the midst of the first wave of coronavirus infections, states that had very low numbers of hospitalizations and deaths in April, but are now beginning to see the virus spread more quickly. But those states are unlikely to see the kind of spread Northeastern states did, and there is hope the virus can be far less deadly going forward if policies can be implemented to better-protect the elderly and vulnerable, especially those living in long-term care facilities.
A metric I would love to see is how many discharges and new admissions.
And on the good news side of things...  Deaths continue to trend downwards and positive tests are flat to slightly down trending.  But, let me just ask...  Aren't we far enough in now that we can start to blame some of this on the protests?
In the last month, our testing has gone from around 8k a month to 16k so as for the cases, that makes sense to see a spike there.  I mean we go from terrible testing rates to slightly better and we see a spike, that's how that works.  >Over the past seven days, North Carolina's curve of cases has been just about flat, with an average of 1,227 new cases per day.  >The state has pretty much flattened the curve of deaths from the novel coronavirus. Over the past seven days, an average of 15 people per day have lost their lives. Overall, 1,262 people have died in North Carolina during the pandemic.
I had a nurse insist that wearing a mask outside was bad. I guess any nurses can be just as stupid as the rest of us.
NC ER Doctor checking in. All the hospitals in my area are bed locked. It is incredibly stressful trying to get people where they need to go safely.   And just because you’re only in the hospital for 2-3 days doesn’t mean it’s not a big deal. I admit you to the hospital because I think that if you don’t get admitted, you will go home and die. If we can turn people around with some respiratory support, then good news! But every hospital admission is a big deal in terms of overall importance, resource utilization, cost to patients, and secondary complications. Each one of these people, even if they get discharged safely, are now at risk for hospital acquired infections, blood clots, and a host of other problems that come with a hospital admission.
https://www.wunc.org/term/tested-podcast "Deciding The Next Step"  >"Latinos are 10% of the population, but 44% of the cases and **7%** of the deaths" (State Wide)  -Deaths aren't going up as much because it's mostly younger people (like Latinos) that are getting more cases. The fact that Hispanics/Latinos are vastly over-represented in Covid cases (like almost **75%** in [Durham County](https://durhampublichealth-durhamnc.hub.arcgis.com/datasets/28d63775a4fd44d3991fd517b3925438)), should be more of a story, but the media/government hasn't said much on that either.
Cities, and it's not really a spike in the sense that a whole lot more people are getting it, it's still mostly a case of more people becoming more available for testing, but the protesting and lots of crowds are allowing for more spread.  Also it's absolutely reaping prison and nursing homes, but that's not new either.
Don't think we ever 'left' the first wave.     We had people claiming we were dropping and past it, but most graphs i've seen simply showed a plateau, not a significant decline.
The first wave finally came here from the rest of the country.
Yeah, there’s no spike. It’s been a steady climb.
Great explanation.   This may have been the best thing I read on Coronavirus data.
This is a logical thinker right here. And also hospitals here in North Carolina are mass emailing, phone calling, and requesting folks to come in to be seen.  North Carolina Hospitals were struggling, so now more people are being asked to get their procedures they have held off on. So, more people getting tested and more people coming into the hospital, which would correlate to numbers increasing? To me it is completely dishonest reporting, or simple woeful ignorance on the media's side. The numbers are ALWAYS going to increase, because MORE PEOPLE are being tested. Always poor reporting and data sharing from the media and they wonder why they get no respect anymore.  Just remember denominators before a massive freakout occurs. 300 Million+ people in the US, 11 Million+ in NC... we are still reacting drastically to less than 1% of people being affected. Stop cherry picking the data, and display it all.
Ongoing 1st wave
I would like to see how many times you people move the goal post. I would also like to see a progression of all the bs theories that have been floated.
It’s looking like the protests didn’t do much in terms of spreading due to being outside and high levels of mask wearing.   Plus, the increase in NC started before the protests.    https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/06/protests-covid-outdoor-masks.html   https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/interactive/2020/06/nationwide-protests-led-spike-coronavirus-cases-200608052743621.html
[it doesn't really look that way per these graphs](https://covid19.ncdhhs.gov/dashboard)
Testing has no impact on hospitalizations.
> it's still mostly a case of more people becoming more available for testing  This is [100% wrong](https://www.newsobserver.com/news/coronavirus/article242594906.html). Where did you get this information?
I agree that number of overall cases is a less helpful metric. Epidemiologists use overall number of hospitalizations as a better metric for overall burden of disease. Unfortunately, this number also continues to rise steadily, even where I practice in rural NC.
Right? We’re still in the first wave. It’s a second wave when the first wave is close to non-existent
We are on the first wave forever. *sigh*
Yes, exactly. At least where I live, the local wakemed doesn't show any signs of being overwhelmed. I live next to a doctor there and he is at home most days, probably isn't needed.
What about the goal posts you people move when spikes dont occur two weeks after thousands attended a race or participated in a prostest?
What also doesn't come up much in conversations is we opened up Memorial day weekend, the week before the protests started.  I remember seeing videos and pictures on the Raleigh subreddit showing people out at bars without masks and not social distancing.
Even if 100% of the protesters wore masks AND stayed 6ft apart there’s still one teency weency little thing that they didn’t do...  Self-quarantine.  Yeah... I guess everyone forgot about that.
From your first link:  *" but they coincided with the reopening of bars, restaurants, and other  indoor establishments, making it hard to trace the upticks to the  protests."*  From your second link, there are also states that the SAH order ended around the start of the protests, but still show no upswing - what does that tell you?  Maybe SAH order isn't needed anymore?  And, the news coverage I saw showed a lot of people protesting, but not wearing masks.  It really would be extremely hard to break these out.
Well, you linked the dashboard page.  You need to dig deeper for the deaths and positive tests.  [https://imgur.com/a/gAvmj6v](https://imgur.com/a/gAvmj6v)
That wasn't what my comment was about though. I strictly pointed out that the number of cases has gone up because outr testing capability has doubled.
at the time of my comment it wasn't.  North Carolina testing is increasing, and with increasing tests taken you get more positive results.  And that's a very big factor in the increase in cases.   It's not 100% wrong.
They're not saying much about that, or the fact that the Latinos/Hispanics (younger people) are [vastly over-represented](https://www.reddit.com/r/NorthCarolina/comments/hc5fjf/nc_reports_highest_coronavirus_hospitalizations/fvfi7v6/) in the new Covid cases.   https://fox6now.com/2020/05/25/thousands-of-racing-fans-pack-the-stands-at-north-carolina-speedway/  -So we got thousands of (mostly not wearing masks) white folks in the stands in Alamance County for the Memorial Day race over three weeks ago, and [hundreds of ReOpen protestors](https://abc11.com/reopen-nc-protest-covid-19/6152963/) over a month earlier. Neither have had Covid outbreaks/clusters assoicated with them. White people are *under-represented* for Covid cases in June.   I keep bringing up race, because the rising Covid cases tell one story, but the demographics (which we are largely ignoring) tell another.
Whataboutism   I never claimed two weeks nor did scientist.
Fourth paragraph in this one. https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/06/no-evidence-that-protests-have-caused-a-coronavirus-surge.html  >In Minneapolis, the epicenter of the protests in late May, 1.4 percent of tests conducted on protesters last week came back positive. That was well under the state’s overall positive test rate at the time, which averaged 3.7 percent for the week. This week, 1,288 people were tested at a Boston site set up for protesters. Fourteen, or 1.08 percent, came back positive. Other locations reporting no measurable spike in cases after widely attended protests include Philadelphia, Seattle, Sacramento, and upstate New York.  IDK what news coverage you were watching, but almost all the coverage I saw showed masks, plus my friends who went to protests around the Triangle, Berkeley, and DC all posted pictures where essentially everyone had on masks.  Plus, from the Slate article  >The absence of surges in the cities with massive demonstrations but few other large gatherings has taken many officials and health analysts by surprise. However, as they’ve examined the data and the video footage, one thing has clarified matters, to an extent: A large percentage of the protesters wore masks.  I don't get why people want to blame the upticks on the protests so much, except for political "gotcha" points. The data is essentially saying that gathering outside with masks on is pretty safe. That should be great news to everyone, especially people who want to open up the state and not have another lock-down.
I thought you were commenting on the article. Which is about hospitalizations.
No, your statement that it's "mostly a case of more people becoming more available for testing" is 100% wrong. If you want to say your basis for making that claim isn't 100% wrong, you'd be right, but the claim is still absolutely wrong.  It is mostly a case of more people getting coronavirus.
I was mostly watching the local Raleigh news - WRAL and Channel 11.  I really don't care if the upticks are coming from protesters, people going back to work, going to bars or whatever.  It's going to happen with everything firing up again.  I just hated seeing the hypocrisy of some saying you are killing people by reopening things, but the protesting is okay.  I do think we need to get back to things.  Safely, of course, and most importantly to protect the at risk groups.  But it is not good for many reasons to keep everything shut down.  And, it almost seems like a select group on here almost celebrate with each new record of hospitalizations and race to come post about it, while staying silent on the days it drops.  BTW - per a recent post regarding antibody testing:  https://www.reddit.com/r/raleigh/comments/hc10qa/major_covid19_antibody_study_finally_released/  *"The good news: This would bring the death rate to between 0.2% and 0.1% (close to CDC's estimation which was lowered about a month ago). That's in line with other more common respiratory viruses. Meaning if these numbers are correct, if you get COVID your chances of survival are about the same as your chances of survival if you get the flu. However, this seems much more contagious, so many more people will be faced with those odds (which is why this virus is so dangerous to the immunocompromised who have a far higher death rate if they contract any virus)."*
Headline states 2nd highest new cases.
alas I feel you're nitpicking but fine.
FFS.... You are quoting some dude on the internet.   > "The good news: This would bring the death rate to between 0.2% and 0.1% (close to CDC's estimation which was lowered about a month ago).

That was NOT AT ALL the interpretation of the data from the Wake Forest data.  The [current IFR is around 1.3%](https://www.healthleadersmedia.com/covid-19/study-puts-us-covid-19-infection-fatality-rate-13). The flu is 0.1%.   Regardless, the flu infects 8% of the US population per year. COVID due to being novel can infect up to 80% of the population.   Please for the love of goodness, read all the sources, figure out what someone is actually posting and saying before blindly quoting them, this is exactly how misinformation spreads.
Thank you for your comment.
Headline *also* states highest hospitalizations.
I would say sorry, but I'm not. Attributing North Carolina's rise in coronavirus cases to 'mostly' a rise in testing is ignorant.  I have close family living there. I am incredibly concerned for their well-being because most people who live there, as far as I can tell, simply *do not care about the virus* -- in large part because they keep hearing the sort of thing you're saying. The whole state is going to feel this one.
And, you quoted an article that is a month and a half old.  How about one from a couple weeks ago that references the CDC directly?  [https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/06/05/fact-check-cdc-estimates-covid-19-death-rate-0-26/5269331002/](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/06/05/fact-check-cdc-estimates-covid-19-death-rate-0-26/5269331002/)  *"The claim: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has confirmed a 0.2% death rate for COVID-19"*  *" The range of estimates put the fatality rate for those showing symptoms between 0.2%-1%, with a "best estimate" of 0.4%.*  *It also places the number of asymptomatic cases between 20%-50%, with a "best estimate" of 35%.*   *By  combining the two estimates, the estimated overall fatality rate of  those infected with the virus – with and without symptoms – would be  0.26%."*
ಠ_ಠ
I understand
So.. even if that number is remotely right, the scales are incredibly different.   Flu = 0.1% COVID 0.26%. Flu infects 8 million per year. COVID could infect up to 80% of the US population.   The flu season in 2018-2019 killed [34,200 people] (https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/2018-2019.html#:~:text=Conclusion,the%202018%E2%80%932019%20influenza%20season.).  COVID has killed more than 120,000 people in less time.   You somehow are telling all of us that they are even remotely equal?   That's [121,000+](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us/) dead with lock-downs across the US, 20%+ unemployment and a halt to the economy. Kindly bugger off with the flu comparison, its never been the same or even similar, and never will be.
I didn't say they were equal.  I just noted that the death rate, while slightly higher, wasn't considerably higher.  Yes, more people will catch it.  But, it is important to know that this is much less deadly than many think, especially outside of the risk groups, and useful when deciding when and how to open things up.  Keep in mind that many of the deaths were in nursing homes.  This, while still is an issue, will be much less impacted by reopening things since they have learned to lock them down.  Also, many other things have changed in how we do things.  The number of deaths nationwide has been steadily dropping as we learn how to manage it.  I've been saying for quite some time that if we knew all the things we discovered, we wouldn't have had the issues we did.  In fact, I suspect that flu season going forward is going to be much less because of all the lessons learned.  And, if a second wave does hit, I believe we are in a much better place to manage it and it won't be like the first wave.
Honest question. Do you know a single latin american who uses latinx? Because I date a south american spanish teacher who is friends with about a dozen other spanish teachers from various countries all over latin america and literally none of them had ever heard of latinx when I asked them about it. And these are all women, by the way, who proudly refer to themselves as latina.   And if you don't believe that then you can watch this video with a group of liberal & conservative latin americans who agree on nothing **except** for the fact that they think latinx is stupid.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyymEC8FQHU
Your sister is a South American Spanish teacher? You lie.

Apple closes some stores in 4 states, again, as coronavirus infections rise

The two stores being closed temporarily are:  Southpark: 4400 Sharon Road, Charlotte  Northlake Mall: 6801 Northlake Mall Drive, Charlotte
They are being proactive. Refreshing to see.

North Carolina Total Corona Virus Cases by Day

Any death from covid is tragic. Just looking at congregate vs non-congregate, there is a large disparity. As of today, from NCDHHS there are 1,104 deaths. Of the deaths only 319 are non-congregate. Of the 42,675 cases, 20,760 are non-congregate. The reason I bring this up is that the congregate population (prisons/nursing homes/assisted living) are a population that rarely, if ever, go out in public.
Phase 3 here we come!
This isn't the best way to show this data. You can't see the rate differences of growth over time, and since testing has been ramped up you likely will still see more infections over time due to the disease still being in the community.   Knowing that, people really should not be going out unless they have to for work, groceries, exercise; and should be wearing a fask mask, staying 6ft apart and washing their hands.   But nah, let's go to the race track, church and unfortunately protests.
Sometimes the simplest charts are the most powerful.  Shows the silliness of it all.
More tests = more cases
It was bound to happen, people are too selfish to think of others. My friend refuses to wear a mask because he can't breathe, but like corona would make it even harder to breathe. Even at protests where he is like one of the 5% not wearing one and sticks out because of it, he refuses. It would take a joint effort from everyone, but mild inconveniences are apparently the end of the world.
I would also like to see this plotted against the various projections for NC in the past months. Are we doing better or worse than what was expected?
Serious question...won't the slope between two points demonstrate rate change (i.e., the steeper the slope, the faster the "growth" during that time).
Well yeah. I think we’re all clear on that. But literally every other important metric is going up with it. That’s the part you didn’t say.
Yes, also   Not wearing a mask, not keeping social distance, thinking the virus is gone or nothing is going to happen to me = more cases
Death rate has been on a steady decline since May 25th.
Actually it is more complicated than that which is why I wish we got more information from medical personnel rather than from politicians and medical personnel who work for or are beholden to politicians.   My personal opinion is that the spread and number of these cases has more to do with population density than it does with wearing a mask or not or at least 6 feet from each other.  You've got places who have instituted mandatory mask rules and cases continue to climb. On the other hand you've got places like my area where mask usage has dropped about as much as 12% (to about 8%) and we remain very low in cases.  Distancing is a factor, so if you got thousands of people piled into an   urban area you're going to have a spread.  Not to mention we need to start trying to figure out how to address some of the collateral damage from the measures we've takes such as depression, suicide, drug and alcohol abuse, health problems exacerbated by delayed/ignored/denied treatment, domestic violence, and crime.
Here’s the thing. A single data point doesn’t paint the picture. I would explain why, but I think I can assume you know that and don’t care or that you don’t know that and it won’t matter.
False. https://covidtracking.com/data/state/north-carolina
This is waaay too reasonable a comment for these conversations. I mean, it’s much easier when this is cut and dry. If you vote left, you’re of the mind that we shut the economy down until there’s a properly tested and successful vaccine. If you vote right, it’s a non-issue.   Glad I was able to clear that up.
Just posting a positive stat. One data point or not, it is still a positive stat amongst this sea of negative
According to this graph, I'm correct   https://covid19.ncdhhs.gov/dashboard/cases
Outside of the context of this thread, I totally and completely agree with you. Inside the context of this thread, not so much.
That's fair.
