Contact tracers help identify growing Macon County COVID-19 cluster

Sounds like the whole church is either sick or about to be sick.

When COVID-19 Created Even More Scarcity, This Network of Western N.C. Programs Stepped Up

I'm not going to say that Stephanie Almeida doesn't help people, but she is batshit crazy.
Trying to do good in WNC would drive anyone crazy. I have never seen so many non-Christian Christians in my life.

Henderson County Sheriff's Office calls covid-19 outbreak a "PLANNEDemic"

I do find this type of situation so very frustrating. It reminds me of many Sheriffs in the last year openly stating that they refuse to enforce certain laws and ordinances. Education is still very much important on this issue due to the sheer numbers of people not wearing masks, continued increase of hospitalizations, increasing deaths, and the explosion of new cases.     Perhaps instead of parroting some indoctrinated personal beliefs concerning Covid-19, the Henderson County Sheriff's Office could formulate a plan of how to deal with citizens refusing to comply with the executive order. I'd be willing to believe there might even be guidelines on how to enforce these matters in our state, but if not I'd be willing to help.   &#x200B;  We can start with not shooting anyone concerning mask usage. Then you could explain that someone not wearing the mandated face coverings are free to do as they please in their own homes, but that the safety of a community is very much the business of government. Then maybe offer them a mask from a box officers could keep in the car, because perhaps everyone in their community might not be able to afford a mask. An officer could even help them to make sure they are using it correctly and not letting their nose hang out and make the mask pointless. The Sheriff's department could turn it into an interaction that could help save lives and tax dollars in their community, especially at a time when many in our country might not have an entirely favorable view of law enforcement.   &#x200B;  Also, as a bonus suggestion, the office of an elected official responding to a constituent might be better received if it did not include all the extra punctuation and the "eye rolling emoji." The matter of selective enforcement isn't one that calls for extra crazy punctuation or a zany emoji for comical effect, instead it violates the very nature of the position of Sheriff and invalidates the oath of office.   &#x200B;  As for some "Education given?!?!" I have some for the Henderson County Sheriff's Office, below I am including the three Oaths of Office that you must take as a Sheriff in the great state of North Carolina. Maybe it's "safe to say" they've not only read these words before, but actually spoken them. I, as well as other citizens of North Carolina should think "every breathing human" Sheriff in North Carolina has heard about this Oath since 1776, but after seeing that post I don't think that after 244 years Sheriffs should be "over being educated about it."    Oaths of Office for Sheriffs   At the time of their swearing in, newly elected sheriffs must take three different oaths of office.   a. The first oath is required by Article VI, § 7 of the North Carolina Constitution. “I, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and maintain the Constitution and the laws of the United States, and the Constitution and laws of North Carolina not inconsistent therewith, and that I will faithfully discharge the duties of my office as Sheriff of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ County, so help me God.”   b. The second oath is required by N.C. Gen. Stat. § 11-7 and applies to every person elected or appointed to office in North Carolina. “I, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, do solemnly and sincerely swear that I will support the Constitution of the United States; that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to the State of North Carolina, and to the constitutional powers and authorities which are or may be established for the government thereof; and that I will endeavor to support, maintain, and defend the Constitution of said State, not inconsistent with the Constitution of the United States, to the best of my knowledge and ability; so help me God.”   c. The third oath is required by N.C. Gen. Stat. §11-11 and specifically applies to the Office of Sheriff. “I, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will execute the Office of Sheriff of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ County to the best of my knowledge and ability, agreeably to law; and that I will not take, accept or receive, directly or indirectly, any fee, gift, bribe, gratuity or reward whatsoever, for returning any man to serve as a juror or making any false return on any process to me directed; so help me, God.”   &#x200B;  Just in case it might slip their minds again here is a link so that they print their own copy to keep handy, just in case they need a reminder.

Fucking idiots
Well I'm fucked
His is not wrong; all that has been talked about the last 4 months is covid. Just like Americans have been aware of the risk of smoking since the 1950s, those that choose not to mask have a right to self determination. From a libertine standpoint, the same Constitutional liberties that allow people to have risky unprotected sex, consume alcohol, tobacco and listen to loud ear damaging music also protects the right of those that choose to walk the streets 'unprotected'; governor's executive orders do not carry the rule of law, only the legislature can enact laws.
You should email this to the Sherriff and to the mayor if you haven't already.
You can't fix stupid.
One problem. The behaviors you mention are all primarily harmful to only the people who consent to participate in them. Not wearing a mask puts all those around you at risk, even those who are wearing masks.
