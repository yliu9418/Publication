Durham second grader dies after fight with coronavirus

I feel like a lot of people forgot about the virus due to all the protests. Crazy how quickly people gave up wearing masks in my area.
Maybe one of these ‚Äúopen NC‚Äù troglodytes can explain to that family how Coronavirus isn‚Äôt that dangerous?
Rip
IME, people were stopping as soon as Phase 1 of re-opening started.  I remember doing my weekly grocery shop after that and only 30% or so of people there were wearing masks.  This week it's even fewer, many of which are older people.  I think it's just an example of giving people an inch then them wanting to take a mile as with any time some regulation is relaxed.  I'm positive we will see an uptick of cases in short order as a combination of the relaxations (both regulatory and sociologically) and the protests.
She gave her life for the economy. I'm sure she and her family don't mind. Greater good and all that...  /s
I want to believe that you forgot the /s, and aren‚Äôt this big of an asshole in real life.
I swear to god the old people literally breathe down my neck

It's obvious sarcasm but he's still an asshole.

LOL We shouldn't rush to judge.  But you COULD understand why someone WOULD.    Kinda like the red hats.

Quickest way to get a Coronavirus test?
Hey all.  Reaching out in a desperate attempt to see what the quickest/easiest path is to get a coronavirus test for active infections.  I‚Äôm thinking of a swab station or something to get in and out and get results soon, although not sure what to expect.  If anyone has done this in the area I‚Äôd appreciate some expertise.  I don‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs actually for COVID-19 or just a type of coronavirus.  As long as its quick.My situation is that my MIL is supposed to come to town later this week and she‚Äôs asked my wife and I to get tested, because we were in Myrtle Beach what would have been 2 weeks prior to her stay.  We do not have any symptoms, so I‚Äôm not sure if I can even get tested if there‚Äôs still shortages.  This is just an attempt at peace of mind for my MIL so she doesn‚Äôt abort what would be a chain of about three weeks of planned staycation events. Thanks for you help.
CVS drive thru testing takes about 24 hours
Wake county is offering testing [https://covid19.wakegov.com/testing/](https://covid19.wakegov.com/testing/)      I was symptomatic and was tested through my Primary Care at one of the UNC clinics when the wake county clinic was filled up.
You went to the protest
Thank you! I think this is our best bet.
This doesn‚Äôt even make sense üòÇ
Yeah it does, you'll understand rventually
Political and off topic.  No, I don‚Äôt think I will.
What they are saying is that "going to a protest" is a valid, acceptable reason to get a test, you don't need to have symptoms.
who said anything about going to a protest?  not everyone is protesting, therefore it's it's completely off topic and irrelevant information.  edit:  whoosh.  I see, I could lie and say I went to a protest to get the test.  I'm an idiot, I'll see myself out.
You're welcomeüëç hope you are beerflu free
