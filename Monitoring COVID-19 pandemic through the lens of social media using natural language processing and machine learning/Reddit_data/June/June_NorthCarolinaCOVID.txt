June 1 2020 - Noon ET: North Carolina's Day Of Mourning (COVID-19)

May 31, 2020  Governor Roy Cooper encourages all North Carolinians to honor June 1, 2020 as a Day of Mourning to grieve the 100,000 people in America, including almost 1,000 in North Carolina, who have lost their lives to COVID-19.  “This is an opportunity to remind ourselves that our death count is not just a number, it represents people, communities and families in mourning,” Governor Cooper said. “I encourage North Carolinians to join in this moment of silence in honor of the people we have lost and their loved ones who are struggling in the wake of this cruel virus.”  More than 100 leaders of faith-based organizations, including Christian, Jewish, and Muslim houses of worship from across the country are leading this national moment of silence on Monday, June 1 at 12 PM EST. Local and state leaders throughout the nation are joining the call for silence including the National Governors Association and the United States Conference of Mayors.  Governor Cooper will order all state flags to be lowered to half-staff in memory of those who passed from Coronavirus.  ****  1.7 Million Cases in the USA.   6.3 Million Cases in the World. 370K Deaths Worldwide

Dogs will shed the virus just like humans (aerosol, poo). We'll see about dog-to-dog transmission, saliva/bite, etc. We'll see how long the virus can remain active (contagious) in big dogs.   And now, we need to revisit Wuhan to look at dogs as the culprit for the start of the pandemic. Did something bite a dog? Did that dog transmit it to humans? Did humans consume the animal?  It's all still a mystery.

This is CDC data (nationwide count). We don't know the number of North Carolinians (who knows: some traveled across country, some cared for patients here, some both, some retired, could be many reasons).  "Data were collected from 1,606,034 people, but healthcare personnel status was only available for 337,440 (21.0%) people. For the 71,768 cases of COVID-19 among healthcare personnel, death status was only available for 40,537 (56.5%)."  There are more qualifiers on CDC's webpage. Hyperlink provided above.  Separately: There's a reddit community to capture obituaries if you are interested.  [https://www.reddit.com/r/medicinememorial/](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicinememorial/)

Brazil has 1,100,000 COVID-19 Positive Cases
Sao Paulo (219K) has MORE COVID-19 infections than New York City (212K). Brazil's total COVID-19 infection (1.1M) is about 50% of the USA's total (2.3M). However, Brazil is currently suffering infections at twice the rate as the USA.For example, Brazil's daily 24-hour total was 52K (!). USA's daily 24-hour total was 26K. (June 22 2020).The USA was high but I don't recall if we had anything in the 50K+ range.

The 50k was backlogged data because one state/region didn’t report for several days prior, according to folks in /r/Coronavirus    Technical difficulties or something!   Not that it isn’t out of control, though.
What’s the point of this post in an NC subreddit?
Thanks for the update.
