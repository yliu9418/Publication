Transylvania county commissioners voted unanimously yesterday to stop/ban short term rentals at campgrounds, hotels, motels, airbnb, etc. for 15 days or less, with exceptions. https://www.transylvaniatimes.com/story/2020/03/30/covid-19/commissioners-approve-closing-lodging-facilities-with-exceptions-through-april-30/44332.html
Just checking in with my fellow apartment complex dwellers:  Are you paying rent today?  Have you heard from your realty company about ***any*** considerations/reductions?  I am a 1099 employee and my company has shut down for 3 months. I technically could pay this month's rent but then I would not be able to pay for car payment, insurance, power, etc.,  Just not sure what to do and can't believe with all these trillions of dollars of stimuli - no one is talking about housing. Or have I missed something?  I'd love to know what everyone else is doing - in these isolating times.  Be well!
I posted this in the unemployment thread but I wasn’t sure if it would get seen since it’s kinda old.   Does anyone know about the pending resolution on applications for unemployment. I have friends who got laid off from Dobrá more than 2 weeks ago and there’s is still pending, but people from sunny point who’re getting their checks and they were laid off a week ago. I applied recently and am not expecting immediate action but I’m worried I might get stuck with the pending resolution. Is it something on the employers side or on the state side?  I know I need to be patient and the office is swamped, but it seems like some people are getting approved much faster than others.
I haven't been out yet this week. Does it seem like the state wide stay at home made any difference on the number of people on the roads vs the county mandate from last week?
I think the advice you've received to call and talk to someone is good advice. Call, explain what you can pay, and ask for straight talk. What happens if I pay 1/3, 1/2? How will deferred payments work, if allowed at all? I'd state something along the lines of "The pandemic has obviously affected my and many people's ability to earn. It is not through mismanagement of personal funds that I find myself asking these questions. What can the property do to work with us during this time?" Be honest, but be firm. If you can't pay, tell them that, then make *them* say what now, and what comes later.  Everyone should remember that your landlord/property management company is not a moral authority. You do not need to feel ashamed or timid about calling and negotiating or asking for specifics. There is an unfortunate dynamic of power that emerges in this situation and many people feel as though they're appealing to a court or something. You have every right to call and explain your case and ask for concession and expect respect. You are a customer as much as a tenant.   You are right: Your complex should be proactive about it. But they will not be. If they refuse to work with you, that's another issue, but determine first whether they even will or won't.
In my experience, (not with this particular crisis, obviously) communication is the key.  Ask any or all of your utilities and rental place if you can make a partial payment.  It shows you are making a good faith effort, and that you aren't neglecting them.  Even when we aren't in a disintegrating economy, many companies will be surprisingly willing to work with you.

Haven't heard anything from rental company besides that there are less people moving in, which makes me sort of happy because my landlord is super rude and not taking any precautions with the virus. I paid my rent today, but had to do so with a credit card
You do not have to pay your rent. The governor issued a block on all evictions. I dont know what protection you are afforded after this whole mess, but for now you're safe.
fewer people on the roads, more people on the sidewalks
I had to grab a few things from Target and it was dead in there. I only saw a handful of people, half of them congregated in the dog aisle where I was trying to get some things.
I've been doing a lot of long walks around town, and I think that it is working. There are way fewer people gathering, and when I went to the grocery store on Saturday afternoon it was very quiet. Seems the panic buying has calmed hopefully.
I've only been out once a week so have a small sample size, but on my trip out yesterday, the roads in North Buncombe were significantly quieter than the week before.
Yeah, I did talk to the Apt. Mgr.  about a week ago.  He basically said Southwood Realty hasn't come up with anything yet as far as guidelines.  I asked if I could just pay 3/4 of rent and he said just hold off until the 5th (which is last day to pay w/o being in arrears).  I was just curious as to how everyone else is handling it.  I will check out Southwood's website and then if I don't hear back from Mgr by 5th - I will just pay what I feel like I can.   Thanks so much for your very thoughtful reply.  I'm sure it will help a lot more people than just myself.
Not having the thread of eviction does NOT mean you don't have to pay rent.  It just means you cannot be immediately kicked out of your home.  That's a really unfortunate misreading of the situation.   It is still incumbent upon you and your landlord to work something out.  You don't want to not communicate and find yourself with late pay penalties, credit score dings, etc.  Please don't spread the mistaken impression that you simply don't have to pay.  That's going to get a lot of people into a bad spot
Yeah, thanks.  I'm just worried about what happens after this - like having 3 mos of unpaid rent.  Ugh.
Which Target did you go to and what time?
Yeah, I went all PSA for some reason. But I'm glad you got it figured out, at least for now. Good luck, friend. Strange times.
This. Same with utilities suspending disconnect due to non-payment. It is still accruing, and you still will have to pay it at some point. You just won't get things shut off if you don't, at least for the time being. Everyone in a tight spot should be talking to their landlord about options.
I heard something on NPR this morning about potentially being able to use security deposit to pay for this months rent. I don't know if that is something that you could leverage?
Arden around 6 pm
I appreciate all the info - sadly i'm still fucked.
It's worth asking - I just can't believe these complexes haven't **reached out** with some solutions.  I really feel like they're waiting to see how many people pay from 1st-5th to decide if they have to do anything.

COVID-19 Asheville Inside Information
I just went in to see a routine medical specialist today, and they told me they are closing their offices next week. My doctor told me the medical community in Asheville is talking amongst themselves and they are seeing a surge of cases here. It hasn't been reported yet, but they are taking in many many new patients/day, and my docter herself has two friends who have been infected. Things are apparently supposed to get really bad in the next 2-3 weeks. Idk I thought it was pretty safe here, but I guess not.
That's the problem.. people thinking it is "pretty safe," not being careful, and not understanding the massive lag time we're all dealing with.  With a ten day time between infection and symptoms, lots of folks being asymptomatic completely, and the massive lack of testing, it's inevitable that the surge is to come.
The media should stop reporting "confirmed cases".   It's totally misleading.  We can't confirm cases we aren't testing for.    I'm in quarantine with covid-like symptoms and it's impossible to get tested in Asheville right now unless you're desperately sick.
WNC is on the way up the curve until April 20ish. That makes right now the worst time to interact with anyone. More cases means more risk of transmission. Stay home.
This inside info is also outside info:     [https://www.citizen-times.com/story/news/local/2020/03/30/coronavirus-update-peak-covid-19-cases-expected-three-weeks/5089418002/](https://www.citizen-times.com/story/news/local/2020/03/30/coronavirus-update-peak-covid-19-cases-expected-three-weeks/5089418002/)
And you are the one that is totally fine with STR owners marketing their place as a refuge for city people escaping the pandemic... we don’t have enough hospital beds, ventilators, and medical staff for the people that actually live here in 2-3 weeks when it gets bad. Remember that, and I hope you don’t need one of those beds. I hope we don’t get that overloaded, but if we do we don’t need all the (should be illegal) STR’s full of out-of-towners.
Does this impact routine prescription filling? My hospital does it through an online portal, but if offices are closing, how do I get my refill?
The folks still driving up here to "get away from it" aren't helping either. The county needs to shut down the airbnbs yesterday.
so much this. I know I keep repeating myself, but WE AREN'T TESTING. the numbers are meaningless. assume everyone you come into contact with has it, or that you do...whichever gets you to be the most cautious.  YOU CANOT GET A TEST unless you are very, very ill.   (also, hope you're feeling better, Taro.)  we don't have tests for people who aren't very sick, and we don't have enough PPE (personal protective equipment) to keep people safe who could potentially be doing testing. I had mild symptoms, called my doc and was told I should probably get a test, but they weren't doing them and without a fever I wouldn't be able to get one. since I can't prove I had it, I also have to assume I didn't, so I could still get it.  if I could GET a test and know for sure, I'd know for sure how to proceed going forward. (I started social distancing several days before everyone else, it'll be three weeks for me tomorrow.)  without a test, you just have to assume that everyone else has it, and that you do, too. if I could get a test, and know I have/had it, I'd know when it was over that I was immune, at least for awhile, and could help others...but since I don't know, and likely won't, I'll be staying home.  it drives me absolutely crazy that this is news to anyone, but I'm glad people are at least asking, and that the good folks here at reddit are here to keep us all honest.
oh word. well confirmed. but like in that article, it says 21 cases. it's way more is the point. because if my doc personally knows 2 people that have it, this is only a town of 100,000 people. that would be a statistical anomaly. what I'm saying is these cases are like way under reported. there are probably loads more and they probably don't want to cause panic, but it's a real and very dangerous thing. I wasn't really scared until this morning.

All the hospitals everywhere are overloaded- not just here. Actually- by comparison, we are lucky. And guess who is being temporarily relocated into town? MEDICAL STAFF. FROM CITIES. Guess where temporary medical staff need to stay? In SHORT TERM RENTALS. people need a place to go right now, and asheville has a ton of short term rentals and hotels, and you would rather all of them stay vacant because YOU dont want the virus to get near you? YA, IM OK WITH IT. STRs should definitely be closed off to tourism, but they need to switch to monthly and stay open so people who need a place to go, have a place to go. LIKE DOCTORS AND NURSES COMING TO SERVE ASHEVILLE.
Call them, I’m sure they’ll find a way. Some are using telemedicine, just call soon to find out how they are handling it.
*if I could get a test, and know I have/had it, I'd know when it was over that I was immune, at least for awhile, and could help others*  Exactly.  So frustrating.  They're trying to develop [antibody tests](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/02/28/810131079/how-a-coronavirus-blood-test-could-solve-some-medical-mysteries) so at least we might be able to find out after the fact.
I would be thrilled if it was rented to medical staff coming here to help. Charging said rescuers $3,250/month (or some other outrageous amount)? Seems unappreciative to me.   If other people want to come here to fill the vacancies and ride out the storm I guess we can’t stop them, we can only hope that they follow the guidelines and immediately self-quarantine for 14 days. This includes the grocery store y’all! You have to make use of delivery service.   It’s certainly not just myself I am concerned about, quite the opposite. It’s my high-risk loved ones, children, neighbors and the entire community- including you. I truly hope you stay well.
I don't think any medical staff will be coming to save us.  What you see is what you get.
that rental was offering discounts to locals and medical professionals. and requiring a quarantine upon rental. maybe some of these places are pricing high to price out out of towners. isn't it illegal to say that you wont rent to someone? wouldn't a way around that be to offer discounts to someone while leaving a price high? just a thought. I haven't seen this surge in newly popping up STRs that you're talking about.. I just saw this thread and happen to know 3 nurses who are still trying to find housing within a 45 minute drive of Asheville
Just search houses for rent in Asheville on Zillow. Many new ones on there and quite a few mention shorter than the usual year lease.   I hope you’re right about the extreme overpricing to discourage travelers as opposed to medical and other essential personnel.   Here’s one I saw in particular for your nurse friends, but there are many: [https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/Merrimon-Ave-Asheville-NC-28801/2080315111_zpid/](https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/Merrimon-Ave-Asheville-NC-28801/2080315111_zpid/)

Grocery Curbside Pickup Associate at Wal-Mart in Weaverville mentioned that the store was limiting the store to 50 customers at a time inside starting today due to people "Treating the Store like a family reunion."  I was there last week and it was packed full, with negligible social distancing being followed.  Strange times indeed when Wal-Mart is enforcing common sense.
Someone check on u/freetalkbot, it's lost the will to make humorous titles.
Quit my job to move up here for a job I only worked 3 weeks at before I was laid off due to COVID19.  Filed a combined GA/NC claim through NC DES and it was already rejected due to the base period in NC being non-existent basically.  I just filed in GA, but since I quit my last job in GA for this one up here, will it just reject me there too?  I cannot fathom what else to do. My car is my only source of income currently and it has issues. I’m applying to all the lovely at risk jobs because it’s the only option.  I know my base period in NC was too low but will they be making exceptions for people who moved during all of this? I am not the only one in this situation, I’m sure. But the loophole could severely fuck things up for me and I have maybe one months’ worth of savings.   If anyone has any advice.. please let me kniw
Still haven't received any unemployment dollars.  STILL showing "Issue Delaying Payment: Laid Off/Lack of Work". Just hit the 18 day mark since submitting my application (March 15). My coworkers who submitted the same day and the day after already received deposits days ago.  ZERO answers, information, or support in sight. I emailed support and have tried calling at 8:00 sharp every day this week. Nothing.  I understand that DES is getting pounded with an unprecedented number of claims.  But one would think they would tackle them in chronological order.  The fact that I can't seem to do anything to help the claim along is the hardest part.  Starting to feel helpless and hopeless.   EDIT: A few hours after posting this, my Issue was lifted and my claim approved. Keep the hope y’all!

Anyone know about Bent Creek closures? Is it just trailhead parking that’s closed? Like is it cool if I rode into bent creek and didn’t park there, or can we not go in at all?
I’m concerned...there was a thread active tonight about infected grocery store employees but now it has disappeared.
Has anyone had success filing for unemployment as an independent contractor? I heard this was coming in the stimulus package but was not sure how to go about getting it. Thanks!
Has anyone been to the Aldi in Weaverville lately? I really need to go shopping but I have heard they really aren't doing anything regarding the current situation. Just wondering if they are taking any precautions!
Tee time prices look the same as ever before.  What gives?
That’s interesting, because I was in Weaverville Walmart last week, too, and it was pretty empty. I mean, there were people in there, but not enough that social distancing was an issue. Same thing with Ingles last week.
COVID-19 Megathread What's the Point Anymore Edition
The pandemic unemployment assistance program (part of last $2 trillion stimulus program) is meant for people that don’t normally qualify for regular unemployment, like independent contractors and people that have already exhausted their regular UI. Not implemented yet though, but hopefully coming soon. Maybe this would help you if you don’t qualify for either NC or GA UI, whenever it’s available.
Same situation here, except I moved from SC. Not sure how it’s going to work out, but if I get any guidance I’ll send it your way.
Same here. I completed mine 3/17 & one of my coworkers completed hers 3/18. She got her benefits yesterday & mine is still pending resolution. I’m getting frustrated but there’s nothing I can do besides wait.
What did you pick as the reason for filing? You need to pick Covid-19/coronavirus as the reason to get the federal unemployment. I'm not saying you didn't, you might have, but thats the first thing I've been asking people.
I would be more worried about the 1million living nextdoor in charlotte

Passed federally but not implemented in nc yet. Called pandemic unemployment insurance. See u/JeffJacksonNC posts about unemployment. You apply through the nc des website, but it’s not set up yet to accept 1099 info. He said to just apply with best of your ability. We did this two weeks ago, says ineligible due to being self-employed but cannot reach anyone to explain. Hope they fix it soon, best of luck!
In the press conference just now Mnuchin said details on that are coming in about a week, maybe something about having to talk to your bank.
I was in Aldi Monday. I had never been before, but I have an older neighbor who’s self-quarantining and asked me to grab him a few things while I was out. My sense is, in Weaverville, not just at Aldi, is that people are making an effort to be mindful and keep their distance from others.   The issue with Aldi, imo, is that it’s a small store with narrow aisles, so it’s not always possible to keep your distance. Not sure what the staff can really do about that, but I definitely noticed employees walking around with spray bottles, presumably to wipe things down. There was also a container of hand sanitizer just inside the entrance for people to use. So I don’t think it’s correct to say they’re doing nothing. It looked to me like they were doing what they can.
I'm an Aldi regular in Weaverville, but haven't gone since the 'Rona has been around. It's just too tight in Aldi to keep any semblance of physical distancing.   I've been instead doing Publix/Ingles instead, and Wal-Mart Curbside pickup. My grocery budget is ballooning without Aldi's low prices.  Sorry I can't answer your question directly, but good luck!
I was there on Monday at about 5:00 shopping for myself and at-risk relatives. Very few people inside. No wipes for carts that I saw, but always bring my own now. Employees were spraying down and wiping shelves with disinfectant. Signs reminding you to keep 6 ft apart. Normally difficult but not with so few shoppers. Unfortunately some of the other shoppers still crowded me as if they were totally unaware. Weird times. As I guess we all stocked up on non-perishable goods and haven’t been shopping as much, there were hundreds of bags of oranges for 45 cents apiece and grapes for 18 cents/pound. Out of paper products, rice and most meat but other than that well-stocked. I would hit it in the evening. Sorry ingles, can’t afford to blow any more money there.
I think because folks are not working they are going to the grocery over the whole day instead of major traffic from 4pm-7pm normally
Come on down and play Megathread Bingo!  * Everything is essential.  * There’s still a shit ton of people out.  * Rumors about someone testing positive.  * Another lockdown order despite there being like four lockdowns(?) * People complaining about NY or FL visitors.  * People bootlicking NY or FL visitors.  * Someone complaining that this is all somehow unconstitutional.  * Mission Hospital doing something wrong.  * Unemployment filing delays.  * Someone asking if a park is open.  * Two people giving conflicting information on park closures.  * Another business closes.  * Someone broadcasting the importance of staying home.  * Someone not getting the picture that a shelter order doesn’t mean you can bounce around to different homes.
Please do! I’m incredibly nervous how this will pan out. I’m in a similar boat with the stimulus check. I don’t have the same address or bank account as when I filed my 2019 taxes. Any idea on that?
I put that as my reason for lay off
I disagree also as someone who works in the grocery business. I am really proud of how our community has been taking precautions at least where I work. Everyone I have encountered has been more than sensible. Obviously that can't be true for everyone or every store/situation but it gives me hope. 25 *is* a small number for an area our size, we can only hope that the number isn't so low because there hasn't been enough testing. Could totally be the case I suppose.
They keep saying that it will be administered through each states existing unemployment system, but nc says they are still waiting on further guidance. Going to have to go back and watch conference, picking up clues to this thing like breadcrumbs.
Thank you! I will be that guy wearing a mask and gloves too so it sounds reasonable to go if I need to!
We are too, we used to go every single Monday afternoon. I miss it so much! We are spending so much more money on food now too. 😭
Why sorry Ingles? Aldi actually pays their workers well.
Thanks for the info!
You’ll need to file a change of address form with the IRS, which takes a bit of time to process. Hopefully they’ll move quickly with this, as I’ve seen many people have that same problem.   https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f8822.pdf
Glad to see things went through!
[Here's the part](https://youtu.be/Xosr3hpAfF8?t=1423) where he talks about independent contractors briefly. Back at about 23:30 is where he starts describing everything in full. What I'm understanding is, all FDIC institutions should be able to make these special loans, the loan is federally backed and turns into a grant at some point.  [edit: url]
Can I ask you a question, and I don’t mean to pry or sound insensitive, but are you wearing gloves and a mask because you’re at a higher risk (pre-existing health conditions, immunocompromised, etc.)? I’m only asking because, if that’s the case, I’d be happy to pick you up some stuff and drop it off at your house, so you don’t have to go out. If that’s something you’d be comfortable with, obviously.   I go into Weaverville like 2-3 times a week right now - I’m planning on making a trip to Ingles tomorrow - so I could easily pop into Aldi. Just let me know. And if that’s not something you’re comfortable with, I totally understand, I won’t be offended, just wanted to offer.
That’s one of the many reasons why I switched about a year and a half ago. Love Aldi so much, and the fact that they compensate employees well is huge. Guess I have some lingering loyalty to ingles just because they started here and HQ is nearby. I also appreciate their partnership with Eblen charities and all of the toy, coat, thanksgiving and school supply drives. But their prices, sales, loyalty program, and compensation to employees suck, for sure! Hence, Aldi for the win.
So on this form, I wouldn’t need to check any boxes since I’ve already filed my 2019 taxes? Just fill out the address portions and then print and mail? There’s no quicker way like scanning? Sorry if you don’t know the answers I just am not sure who to ask.
The PPP loans designed for small biz are probably going to be a guide book for you. I just realized that it won’t work for my SB due to a clause that regulates how much I can spend on rent and utilities vs payroll.  When they do roll out the application be sure to catch exactly how to qualify for the FORGIVEN loan. These are loans, not grants. The SBA does both loans and grants and will be forgiving some loans.
Bless you for linking that! Going to dig into all of this tomorrow with a fresh mind, before 1st grade poetry lesson :)
Thank you so much! That is so sweet of you to offer. I am not immunocompromised but I do work at another grocery store where I can't get everything I need and I am exposed to the public a lot so I worry more about being an asymptomatic carrier. I wear gloves at work mostly because it stops me from touching my face or any other personal surface like my phone while I wear them. Also masks are just being suggested now as a precaution and my MIL sewed some for our family so I use it if I go anywhere besides work just as a courtesy to others.
This is so kind! u/Jericha I’ve noticed and appreciated your helpful gestures over the last few weeks, and just thought you should be recognized! I would give you an award if I wasn’t a broke unemployed bastard right now :)
I’m not completely sure on that. It may be worth giving the IRS a call just to clarify.
This is all so tricky, thank you so much for the information!!
Ah, ok. Just wanted to make sure you were ok. And thanks for being aware and doing your part. Which should go without saying, but it seems like some people didn’t get the memo.
Awww, thank you! All things considered, I’m doing ok through all of this, and I’m low risk, from a health perspective, all of which I am grateful for, so I’m more than happy to help when and where I can (within reason, I’m not going to needlessly expose myself or others). And grabbing a few things for people while I’m already going into town is something I can easily do.   Plus, it’s good for my mental state. Otherwise, I just sit around ruminating about all of the ways this just *sucks*.   Fortunately, aside from the neighbor I mentioned above, all of my neighbors and other people I know are doing ok, so that’s why I’ve been keeping my eye out on Reddit.
Lollll yeah I doubt I’d even reach a human. I tried DES three days in a row right at 8am and it never would put me through, just a call back later and hang up. If the IRS is dealing with much the same yikes.  Worth a shot though
The amount of elderly people I am seeing come in to the store with no protection at all is really scary. Even just covering your face with a scarf or bandana and wearing gloves can help those people lower their risk. Either they don't believe they will get sick or they just don't care. It's super sad.
Taking care of your neighbors and still keeping an eye out on Reddit for people falling through the cracks... BRAVO! Now this is community. Thank you for your service to others and outstanding common sense. And to all the others doing the same- Good karma coming your way eventually ;)
I guess my feeling about that is, if they choose not to worry, that’s their choice, I suppose (in terms of their own health, they could still spread it, which is obviously a major concern).   That being said, what worries me are the people who want protection but can’t or don’t know where to get it, or who really should be staying home but don’t have a choice but to go out (like, they don’t have anyone to go shopping for them). Those are the people I’m trying to be on the lookout for, particularly the latter category, if you know of anyone, because I think a lot of people are going to fall through the cracks during all of this.

Anyone concerned about COVID-19 (which should be EVERYONE): Please read!

Are there “no tests” or only tests for severe cases? How many tests are there?
Screw concern, we're way past that. *Let's all PANIC!*
What's covid-19?
Thanks for letting us know, and goddamn thanks for your service - there's someone I know who has pneumonia and they said they tested them and came back negative for COVID. Are you saying that they weren't actually tested and they're lying? That would be even more scary...
Lots of people are dying of “pneumonia” and never being tested for COVID, even after death.
What's covid-19? Should I be concerned??
I know. Everyone's head is in the sand. It is wildly disappointing.  Godspeed.
You only need to look over the State line to the rapid rise in numbers over the last three days in the counties on or close to the line, e.g., Greene, Washington, Sullivan, to know we aren't even close to out of the woods. I say the recognizing that Tennessee has been horribly behind the ball on implementing Stay at Home orders. Those counties just got them THIS WEEK.
To answer your question: no.
I have no idea how many tests there are to be honest. They are telling us only for healthcare workers and severely ill hospitalized. However, that has also not been confirmed. If you do not fall into those categories, at this time, do not expect to be tested. This could change day by day as new methods become available. I have not seen any of those methods in this area. See Sen. Jackson’s update from this week regarding wide spread testing for our state.  Edit: spelling
Not enough. NC has been awful from the start and we were weeks behind other states to even start testing anyone that didn’t show symptoms.
I think it's a new type of beer
Let me clarify, there WAS testing approximately 1.5-2 weeks ago with our drive through pop up sites, multiple urgent cares and emergency rooms testing. There is no doubt your friend had a test and was negative. From my perspective I have been unsuccessful in getting any of the patients, that need to be tested, tested for the past 1.5- 2 weeks. This is likely not going to change unless new methods are made readily available. I only hope to warn people that we will see decreasing numbers as time goes on. This does not negate the spread of this virus, unfortunately.  Edit: forgot to say thank you in typing my reply!
Not to worry, it’s just a mild flu.   Obviously sarcasm, before I get burned at the stake. COVID-19 is the disease associated with this strain of coronavirus
The states controlled by Republican governors will destroy any hope of a quick return to normal operations for absolutely no reason other than selfishness and refusal to believe basic science.
I have nothing but respect for you, sir. In post after post I keep noticing that you're one of the very few who is not panicking, and actually thinking clearly. Well done, and keep it up, but I am sad for your karma.
Who is exactly is "they", as I know someone that started showing symptoms earlier this week. They called their PCP and were directed to come into the triage unit they had set up. Tested negative to Flu and were subsequently tested for COVID. Whole process took about 40 mins.  *edit* by process I mean the testing process. They are still awaiting their results.
Ok PHEW that makes me a LOT less paranoid thanks for clarifying haha! I'm still going to stay inside as much as possible. <3
Thank you. And don't worry about the karma. Unlike some others on this subreddit, my self worth isn't determined by upvotes and downvotes. Only truth.
Would you mind to PM this office? I am desperate to help my patients and have no where to send them. Also they is our local health department.
You have PM

One Buncombe is a covid disaster help program that I just heard about. It apparently helps pay bills for people who lost their jobs from this.

I imagine banks are sorta on edge right now given all the people wearing bandanas as homemade masks
Article in ACT 2 confirmed but 122 suspected.   “ In a March 31 letter to the National Labor Relations Board, Mission's legal representation wrote that as of March 29, the hospital was caring for two confirmed COVID-19 cases — and an additional  122 patients under active investigation for the new coronavirus”
Why have you put “runny nose” first on the list of symptoms when the chart you linked says runny nose is “rare” for COVID-19?
Good morning.  Lots of news this morning about an impending [recommendation to wear masks](https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/02/politics/trump-birx-face-masks-coronavirus/index.html). But until now, [we've been told there was a dire shortage](https://twitter.com/Surgeon_General/status/1233725785283932160?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buzzfeednews.com%2Farticle%2Fzahrahirji%2Fcoronavirus-face-mask-cdc-n95-surgical-fabric-homemade).  Anyone have any clarifying links? I know lots of people have been making their own, but are they effective? Is there something other than the n95 that everyday citizens should be using so they don't worsen any shortages?  Just trying to get a dialogue going.  Edit: [I do see the NYTimes has a helpful article about DIY](https://www.nytimes.com/article/how-to-make-face-mask-coronavirus.html). But I still can't find a lot of information that clarifies if people should be doing this in lieu of buying something specific.  Edit 2: [BuzzFeed has a really useful article about this](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/zahrahirji/coronavirus-face-mask-cdc-n95-surgical-fabric-homemade). I admittedly didn't have time to read it carefully, but I still didn't see anything about everyday use. Still, it appears that the best advice at the moment is: If you choose to cover your face to help slow your possible passive spread of the virus, cover it with what you've got, including with homemade or improvised masks. I'm sure more information will come once the recommendation to wear masks becomes official.
Has anyone had any luck getting a grocery pickup slot? I keep trying Harris Teeter and Walmart but they’re always booked
If you bought or own a bunch of N95 masks and are not elderly or immunocompromised, please donate them to the local hospitals. I went to Harris Teeter this morning and saw multiple young adults wearing N95 masks. PLEASE PLEASE donate these unless you're immunocompromised.  Health care workers are exposed to way higher amounts of a viral load than you are. If it makes you feel better wear a cloth mask that you make or buy. Also, there were about 10 plastic gloves lying in the parking lot. Pick up your shit and throw it away. Sorry had to rant.  Edit: I was too vague with my statement and yeah probably judged these young people. I do not know what they are going through. You guys are right. My statement is more so if you don't need them, donate them. I apologize for offending you guys in the posts. We are all on this sub to help each other through these difficult times.
Don't forget that conjunctivitis is a common symptom.
No official source, but I heard a manager at the Reynolds Ingles is in self quarantine after displaying covid symptoms. Can’t confirm, but be extra careful if you go there.
Does anyone know if craggy gardens is still accessible ?
Anyone selling a road bike or vintage road bike to make extra cash this week pls let me know. Stay safe everyone
Give me all your cash or I'll cough on you.
Reality is, this is a novel virus. Our immune systems have never been exposed to it. Every weapon our individual immune systems have to fight this virus is potentially used, including runny nose. This rarity bullcrap has been proven wrong as often as it's been confirmed.  If you have any symptoms at all, you should pay attention to your lungs and shortness of breath and seek medical attention if your lungs starts feeling like you've breathed in steam.
Good point
Apparently blue shop towels make even better masks than woven cotton materials. Fit is also essential. I've been trying a few of the different patterns I've found online to see what fits best on my face, and I also incorporated pieces of pipe cleaner sewed in by the nose to get a tighter fit.

Mask, scarf, bandana... Anything helps reduce the spread.   Any locals making masks?
Even homemade masks reduce the viral load, supposedly, even if it's not as much as a surgical mask, which is itself not as effective as the N95s. But it still might be the difference between a mild and a severe case, apparently.
Here is a link to an article about different materials to use for a mask and how effective they are. Answer is 100% cotton or a pillow case. https://smartairfilters.com/en/blog/best-materials-make-diy-face-mask-virus/
So should we be wearing masks any time we leave the house now or just any time we plan on going into closed quarters with other people?  Right now, my partner and I are really only leaving the house to go on 1-2 walks a day around our neighborhood. We haven't masked up and probably don't plan on masking up since we're outdoors and only go inside once we get back home.  I planned on donning one of our n95 masks that we had prior to this outbreak when we go to the grocery store to resupply next week. I'm wondering if that is sufficient? Wearing the mask every time I go outside seems overbearing, especially since Asheville isn't particularly dense when walking around outdoors. I can totally understand donning it indoors though - especially grocery stores.
That's sound like a luxury mask or price gouging.
No, I haven’t!  I called HT last week and they said new time slots would drop at midnight. I think this was on Tuesday. Next morning at 6:30 there were non to be had.  I routinely ck around to other stores but no luck.  Finally just gave up and went during immune compromised time.
I found one at 8pm one evening for the following week.
I've been making Thursday my weekly grocery trip, and have had luck getting a Walmart pickup spot on Those days. I have to wake up at one in the morning Tuesday late night and go to the site and refresh until a spot opens and grab it. Maybe midnight works too. Good luck! What's weird is that there are ten parking spots at pickup at the WalMart I go to and I have never seen more than three used.
Errr... what? Grocery pickup slot? Is this a service you're taking advantage of or is it a policy in place at your local grocer's?
I brought this up in another thread, but I am a 'young' adult that has four N-95s from a drywall project. I've been using a single one on my weekly trips out.  Two of them (including the one I have been wearing) are coated with drywall dust/sawdust so I'm not sure if they are fully functioning, and the other two I have bagged up and ready to donate to my ER Nurse friend when he lets me know.   Gross on the glove litter, though. I'm not sold on them as any sort of barrier anyway (but each to their own.)
Your data point of "seeing young adults wearing N95 masks" means absolutely nothing – as you "permit" yourself with the note of being immunocompromised, you have no idea from your ocular pat-down another person's health status and risk profile. Those people could have their own set of challenges, or could be delivery shoppers coming into contact with multiple people, some of whom could be sick and under mandated quarantine.  You got your Internet points with the virtue signal; perhaps redeem them at the prize counter for a mirror.  Fully agreed with the new glove litter though – no need for that :)
[Its closed](https://www.nps.gov/blri/planyourvisit/hours.htm#CP_JUMP_5149272)
The road and trails are still open. Parking may be an issue, though.
Of course I agree that we should all be staying attentive and cautious regarding any sickness right now. The contradiction just seemed a little misleading/confusing to me.
There are some locals making some. We got a call at the store offering to make us some since we are staying open. I dunno the org name or anything.
https://www.facebook.com/masksoflove/
And it looks like even the improvised masks can help stem the passive spread of the virus (from those without symptoms who unknowingly carry it along) pretty effectively:  [From the BuzzFeed article posted above](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/zahrahirji/coronavirus-face-mask-cdc-n95-surgical-fabric-homemade):  "...a cotton mix material had about 70% filtration efficiency compared to roughly 57% for a pillowcase, about 62% for linen, about 54% for silk, nearly 51% for a 100% cotton T-shirt, and nearly 49% for a scarf."
Difference between a mild and severe case? Is that true?  Either you get it or you don't. How the virus affects you had more to with your specific immune response to the virus, not how many tablespoons you ingest.
Awesome.
Most N95's aren't meant to be reused and if not sized properly can be ineffective. While they are always better than nothing, if you have extras it would be great to donate them to the local hospitals or other hospitals in need. Is it sufficient? Sure, but once you use it two or three times, it will start to have minor holes and not fit properly.   What the CDC/government will most likely recommend are cloth masks in areas where there is a high incidence of disease. We are not there yet and hopefully won't get to that point. But get a cloth mask. After you go to the store, take it off properly and wash it.
It took my wife 3 hours to make one that is sort of ill-fitting. She's not great at sewing, but it does take a lot of effort and expertise to make it properly. Before you accuse a business of price gouging, take a second to think through how long it would take and what wage you think a seamstress deserves to make on a mask.
Uhhh yeah, no price gouging here - these are expertly sewn, washable cloth masks from a hard working local seamstress. Well worth the $8 or $12!!
...or, you know, handmade
Hey thanks for that! I kept looking for HT pickup times and everything is booked solid.  Guess I'm staying up till midnight tonight. :)
When you order groceries online you choose a time slot for when you’ll pick them up, if a time slot can be found apparently.
I apologize if you felt attacked mate. Yeah if you have an old used one, hell I'd use it too.   The issue with reusing is that over times the elastic will over stretch or you'll begin to have micro holes in the filters. At this point, something is better than nothing. This is why I think for the average person, a cloth mask that can be washed and you can add filters to are better than nothing for weekly trips.  Also good on you for having them ready to donate!
I absolutely agree. I have no idea their story. All I meant to say was if you do not need them, don't use them and donate them. Also if you're coming in contact with someone whose under quarantine then you yourself should be under quarantine for 2 weeks.   I am not on here for internet points.
Embrace the anonymity of Reddit and just say which store you work at.  *Edited to be less of a dick
Viral load is very real. It's the reason young health care workers are dying. They are exposed to a much higher viral load. It is very much so a combination of viral load (tablespoons ingested) and immune response.
There's no way to be certain until months or years from now when high quality studies will have results, but there's [reason to believe](https://www.reddit.com/r/Virology/comments/fu03jz/nyt_op_ed_princeton_biochemist_suggests_low_dose/) that higher exposure [is correlated](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/fpncjx/sarscov2_viral_load_and_the_severity_of_covid19/) with more severe cases.  >The importance of viral dose is being overlooked in discussions of the coronavirus. As with any other poison, viruses are usually more dangerous in larger amounts. Small initial exposures tend to lead to mild or asymptomatic infections, while larger doses can be lethal.  Also,  >Suppose you get infected with one plaque-forming unit (PFU). It will take it longer to get to high enough copy numbers where it would cause illness and that would give the immune system a head start.  >Suppose you do mouth-to-mouth on someone who just went into flash pulmonary edema as a result of COVID-19 (a physician in the r/medicine subreddit claims to have done this on his father, who sadly did not survive). Then you are going to get hit with 10^6-10^12 PFU and that is going to get ahead of your immune system. The physician in question survived, but he described his course (while mourning the loss of his father) as "not so mild."  >Similarly, probably the sickest I ever got was when a kid who turned out to have Influenza A coughed directly in my face from less than a foot away. I must have gotten an enormous viral innoculum.
Thank you for saying this.  Sewing is a lot more tedious and time consuming than people think.  It’s under appreciated and therefore a dying skill.  We just outsource to other countries.  I had a children’s clothing line for 6 years and shut down because I couldn’t compete when consumers just buy kids clothes from old navy and target.
Maybe give them a call and find out release time.  Hope it works for you!
Thanks that's what I figured. I worried for a while that some stores were introducing a curbside-only system and wondered why I hadn't heard anything. This makes sense though.
High five – sounds like we're on the same page.
Why insult me with the mirror comment? No need for that mate. We are all in this to help each other.  Sorry if I offended you with my initial post, I should have been clearer.
Thank you for the response. I assumed it was that one. I also assume its near the VA as the store is incredibly busy and I see no precautions being taken by anyone. Stay safe and thanks for your continued effort to serve the people

Freakiest thing about this whole thing so far is gas getting below $1.50.  Do I need a Sam's club membership to get gas there?
I'd like to thank the members of the West Asheville fire department  for leading by example and wearing a mask while shopping.
Hey, is the city or county or a non profit giving grants for folks to buy sewing machines? And or sourcing and securing material  I'm starting to think the PPE issue won't be resolved for another 12 months or more and we are a small city compared to others, so we are very low on the totem pole.
If you are able to contribute, East Fork pottery is running an awesome fundraiser right now for a WNC health clinic that serves under/uninsured Latinx farm workers.

I need to get my 2 year old out the house for some fresh air. Anyone know a big field/flat trail somewhere we could meander around away from others?
Thank you!!
Is anyone struggling with health insurance? I faced really high premium costs but Hummingbird Insurance was able to get both me and my two roommates free insurance. They're still operating over the phone. I don't know how they do it, but they're amazing.
Okay the CDC says need to wear masks... Can the mega thread have a section for those making masks?
Since the city suspended yard waste pick up for who knows how long, can it be taken to the dump/transfer station and dropped off ourselves?
Good, rational, interview with a Stanford doctor.     [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UO3Wd5urg0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UO3Wd5urg0)

Yes, according to the Weather Channel pollen activity has been and is moderate to high. My first real spring in ten years. I though for sure I had covid and was going to die three weeks ago now realize I just have allergies.
I left work early cause I thought I might be getting sick. It wasn’t until around 10 pm I remembered the rum, pbr, and cheap pizza I consumed the night before.
This doesn't sound good.....  "There's been a long-running suspicion that confirmed cases are massively under-representing actual cases," Baron said. "You call an ER right now and say, 'I think I have COVID' — they'll say, 'assume you do and stay home.' You're not going to get a test." 
someone finally said it
Well he doesn't use spray tan or hair dye.  2 staples for the grand OLD party
I'd throw a leg over him.
Yes
1.45/gal this morning! Amazing. I have a membership just for gas, it's nearby and it's usually a lot cheaper than nearby stations. But I drive a lot, too. I have a business plan, I can add you on if you'd like (you pay the yearly dues). That one allows you in before non business memberships.
It pays for itself if you’re regularly using it for gas, as well as certain things in store. Highly recommend. Every now and then they’ll have a groupon for a $35 annual membership that comes with $35 in gift cards and some free bakery/produce platters as well.
I was wearing a mask and I saw a group of them gathered together as I walked by. They looked at me and I wondered if they were judging me. 😂Glad to see they are taking care.
Walk on the Greenway by Montfort then walk up in the neighborhood on the wide sidewalks - super pretty there now with trees and flowers blooming!
Was at the UNC-A campus this morning. Tons of space on the quad, with lovely blooming tress, and according to the UNC-A Security Office, you can use the space. Parking wide open too. Bring a little potty if that's how your kid rolls; no buildings are open.
New Belgium has a big O.K.’ lawn that I’ve seen families use - whenever I’ve run by there there usually 1 family there letting their kids run around
~~Not sure if Warren Wilson college's trails are open right now, but the dogwood pasture is a great spot to roam. It's the one on riceville rd just to the left of the college.~~
I wish they hadn't closed hominy creek trail. Very few people were hanging out there. Honestly, I've discovered a lot of pretty and nice neighborhoods with cute houses in West Asheville now that I've had to find a new place to walk my dog. There are lots of flowers right now you can point out and not many people out. Please avoid playgrounds right now, though it must be tempting.
We walked along Reed Creek Greenway. Saw families out and enjoying playing around the creek. Everyone was keeping their distance.
Well whats the coverage like?
Yeah there are some various solutions. A pattern would be good. I am waiting on an etsy mask but have made my own no sew version with a piece of cloth and hair ties to use until then.   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1r2C1zGUHbU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1r2C1zGUHbU)
What do you mean, like locals who are making and selling them or resources to DIY? Or something else?
Call the stump dump on Riverside Dr, they'll know what to do.
Good news is that sneezing isn't a common Covid symptom.
It’s like when Russia reported only one case but admitted pneumonia related deaths were up 3000%
It's been weeks and they still have so few tests available! When are we going to see a reasonable number of tests?
If you drizzle enough chocolate syrup in vanilla, it goes down real nice.  Great username btw you faery slayer
Thanks for the info
Will DM u, thanx king
Many friends have commented that Sam's Club employees are acting responsibly, but the customers have no concept of social distancing.
But then you have to go into a Costco 😰
I believe Warren Wilson has closed the campus and the trails. I also believe they've put up private property no trespassing notices on that dogwood pasture but that was before all this
WWC trails are closed. Got an email last week.
They don't provide the coverage they broker it for you. So I got a blue cross blue shield program that would have normally cost around $600. I don't know how they do it, honestly. I was just really disheartened by the insurance offered me so I was looking online for options. They had fantastic reviews and happened to be down the street from me. I'm disabled but not officially recognized as so by the government and my two roommates work restaurant jobs (or did.)  I tried for months to be recognized as disabled to get medicaid, but the burden of proof is really high and my condition isn't well understood.
Spread the word: https://diymask.site/
So far it's not been a shortage of tests (swabs) available to be collected. It's been a backup at the labs themselves to be able to get the result in a reasonable amount of time. Test results on hospitalized patients have been taking anywhere from 4-12 days to come back
No prob bruddah 🤙
I’ve been 3 times over the last few weeks and that is absolutely correct. Luckily they offer a thing with their app where you use your phone to scan barcodes and check out so it’s easy to completely avoid most everyone.
I’m not sure if that’s exactly how Sam’s Club memberships work.
Laaaaaaaammmmmeeee but totally reasonable  E: I'm a drop out, still paying my loans off to them. This upsets me mildly.
Good to know!!
lol, brilliant

80% of people with coronavirus (COVID-19) have mild symptoms.

Remember 'mild symptoms' are anything that doesn't require ventilator usage.
80% of KNOWN cases. It's probably far, far greater than that when you factor in ALL cases.  No one knows what that number is right now.
Framing is really important: "80% of cases have mild symptoms" is the same thing as  "20% of cases have moderate to severe symptoms, including hospitalization and death".    Both of those statements are equally true, and both of them point the message in a specific direction. The reality of how dangerous this disease is probably lies somewhere in the murky middle.
I'm one of the people this will probably kill if I get it, so while 80% of you may have mild symptoms and be fine, a lot of us will not.  Please stay home.
Just upvoted this to get it from 0 to 1 upvotes... Who would downvote this, and why?
Yes I think you're right that there's probably much more people than that who've gotten it and not been reported, and that means the virus is actually much less lethal than has been reported, which should be a great relief.  I was listening to NPR's Up First podcast today and they said the newest and best computer models are revising the estimated number of US deaths down to 45k-120k at the most, which is about half of what the previous models estimated.
Deniers see this as "see, there's very little danger! Open the stores back up and get to work!"  Other see this and say "numbers are wildly underreported, we are all carrying the disease and endangering others"  And, because of the vacuum of leadership on the national level, none of us will ever know the truth.
Data isn’t as effective as hysteria inducing sound bytes. Because reading and math and not exciting as media froth.
Ment ventilator. Brain fart from previous conversation this morning. Will edit for clarity.
There are many problems with any predictions and it comes from the fact there is just no good data associated with this thing.  For example, in the simulation mentioned, does it distinguish between dying due to Covid-19 or dying with Covid-19.  It's not splitting hairs and an important distinction.  Most countries, states, municipalities are counting anyone dying with the disease as dying from the disease.  It does not matter if the person was already dying from another illness.    There is also a HUGE problem with knowing the number of cases.  Right now we simply have no way of knowing and could be underestimating it by a few times to a few hundred times.    Below is a link to an interview with a Standford research doctor that speaks to the lack of data.  He currently thinks the mortality rate is greatly over-estimated (he thinks it may be as low at 0.05% where the flu is 0.1%) but admits that he doesn't know because of a lack of data.  But he also says that anyone else making a claim, such as Dr. Fauci who claims it to be 1% also does not know for the same reason.  It's a very rational, no agenda interview that is worth a watch.  Lastly, what bothers me a great deal is when a person like the Surgeon General steps the podium and makes extremist statements that this week is going to be like 911 and Pearl Harbor.  There is zero need for that and it accomplishes nothing besides creating undue panic.   It also makes me think he is completely out of touch with what's going on.

>Asymptomatic infection has been reported, but the majority of the relatively rare cases who are asymptomatic on the date of identification/report went on to develop disease. The proportion of truly asymptomatic infections is unclear but appears to be relatively rare and does not appear to be a major driver of transmission.  Yes.  That is from the World Health Organization's website.  It's funny that everyone still runs with the idea that asymptomatic people are as contagious as someone in the throes of the disease, but it's all about link clicks while fact-checking gets a backseat at best.

Locking people down and quarantining them at home will do no good when every Lowes, Costco and Walmart look like Grand Central Station on a daily basis. Nobody wearing masks or really even self distancing.
If you are currently seeking employment (since people decided to downvote this as a post?) there are still companies (outside of grocery) hiring. List here: http://www.landofsky.org/pdf/COVID/CompaniesNowHiringList_April2020.pdf
At Ingles out doing my weekly shopping run and this is the first time I've seen the one way aisle and like 90% of the store wasn't following it. Multiple times people stopped and did the old "Oh heeeey" and congregated and took up the aisle and talked about how hard it is not to touch your face.   A few times a teenager Ingles employee was having to tell full grown adults how a one way works and after they rolled their eyes and snickered like a teacher called them out in class.   Tons of respect to that dude who consistently kept telling people though.  When I was checking out and the dude behind me backed up and went "Oh you probably want me to be 6 feet away huh" and the cashier went "Oh ha nah you're fine I know you" as if it only spreads from strangers.  So incredibly frustrating and scary at the same time.
My father in law said that Fuddrucker's is gone for good because of all this virus stuff, that it couldn't keep up with the rent at it's location (which is in the neighborhood of $18k a month!!) with the reduced business. Is that true?
Spain is talking about implementing a [UBI](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-05/spanish-government-aims-to-roll-out-basic-income-soon) for its citizens. I'm curious how this will develop and effect Europe's economy in the long run.
So I take this shift as a good sign...

I live in a small apartment building and my next door neighbor keeps having friends over every single day. Yesterday they were hanging out on the front porch and now I don't feel comfortable using the porch. I'm so annoyed.
I believe the grocery stores and Lowes/Home Depot will be the hot spots to focus on containment of the virus.   I am astonished that masks are not required by all employees and actually by all customers as well.  I am also surprised they are not closed for employees to pull items for pick up only during safe hours so they do not have to mingle with customers to fill pick up and delivery orders.  To close all other businesses down and not require additional safety procedures for grocery/hardware seems almost useless.  Everyone is crowding these locations and airborne transmission must be high.   I am ordering for pickup but all the slots are now full at HT.
I work in the shipping department of a factory. I'm coming out of my two week COVID quarantine from having symptoms, and they're still open somehow, and may want me to work. I know places are allowed to be open if people maintain a six foot distance, but I don't think that's possible at that job. Also, forklifts are shared between employees. I probably already had COVID, so I'm very concerned about, even after the quarantine, giving it to others at this job, as many are older. Part of me feels like I should be grateful for a job and go in anyway - another part of me says maybe this is something that should be reported? What are the rules here?
I'm morbidly curious about the impact on the crime rate. I wonder if property crimes are down? I also wonder if domestic crimes are up? It must be strange for couples and families that have problems to be locked up together. I think I heard that in Wuhan the divorce rate went up significantly during their quarantine. Also, is anyone else weirded out when they hear sirens or see the hospital helicopter flying over? I have a lot of time for dark thoughts while locked up inside! :-). Edit: https://thehill.com/homenews/news/490564-divorces-skyrocket-in-china-amid-lockdown
Anyone know of hotels allowing healthcare workers to stay if they are concerned about exposing their family?
I’m in mission right now. The doctor told me they only have one covid patient admitted right now and that last week there were four, and all of them recovered and are now home. Hopefully this means that the curve has been sufficiently flattens. If so, good work people!! Those of us with high risk family members thank you!
I had to go to Lowe’s for an actual home emergency. I was amazed at the amount of people 65+ I saw inside wearing masks but buying completely unnecessary items like potted plants & patio furniture cushions. Like, you’re concerned enough to wear a mask... but not concerned enough to stay at home? Completely nonsensical.
Never been happier not to work at Lowe's anymore, tell you hwat. This must be a whole other level of 100 Days of Hell.
Thanks for saying this.  I had this same problem at the West Asheville Ingles but didn't want to bring it up because I thought I would look like a whiner. A couple people in face masks, but most not (I get it, there's been confusion on who should be wearing them up until last week). No wipes for carts which I had seen at other Ingles.  The worst problem was lots of people getting way too close to me, and making no effort to avoid me. Also people speeding through the isles so I don't have the choice to get out of their way.  If you're not going to make any effort to avoid people, at least give them the chance to avoid you.  I know this '6 feet rule' is new, but I've ingrained it so deeply it feels really rude for people to ignore it .  Also, this is their own choice, but none of the staff were wearing masks, which had me worried for their health (and everyone else's health, but they're far more at risk). They were getting so close to so many people and touching lots of surfaces. I hope this isn't due to lack of access.  I think at some point it's up to management to keep everyone safe. They can't do everything, but they can do some things. Require and provide masks for employees, have tape with six foot waits for the line, have customers stand back from the counter, break up any gatherings. Of course I don't know what they're going through or how much stress they're experiencing at this point. But grocery stores are many average people's main contact point right now and they need to be diligent.
Yeah thats infuratinf. Hence why i don't shop at Ingles.
I think it’s pretty obvious that companies like Ingles and Harris Teeter don’t really care. If you want to go somewhere that is doing something to follow the guidelines Trader Joe’s and Whole Foods are your options. It’s worth the peace of mind to drive a little further and maybe not get the exact things your looking for.
I can’t speak for Fudds in particular, but CRE leases are much more expensive compared to their residential cousins. So that $18k month price tag doesn’t shock me.   Keep in mind that commercial leases are multi-year, the turn-over is lower*, and the square footage is HELLA BIG compared to a typical residential unit.   For the sake of argument, it’s not crazy to consider that any given restaurant pulls $50k a month in revenue. But keep mind that there are a lot of bills to pay besides rent and salaries. So it’s also not crazy to consider that same restaurant is barely in the black, if not in the red from month to month.   *lower turnover in a typical retail space. Some markets see extreme turnover and some markets have extreme demand for prime commercial units.
Interesting...
If something is free the *value* must be questioned.  I imagine Spain will be faced with mass inflation.  $1 will = equal .01.   We've seen this time and time again when countries have a spike in printed money.  Let the downvoting begin!
Problem is they could definitely be sharing an air ventilation system with your unit.  If someone in your unit is in a major heightened risk category, it may be worth informing the neighbors.
Agreed.
Call 211 and ask, or your doctor also. Can also ask on r/NorthCarolina for more exposure if you want.   If you've already had it, I think passing it around shouldn't be a big issue but I'm not a doctor
Well someone stole a piece of shit broken bike frame off my porch two days ago in West Asheville but that’s par for the course. Would love to see what the fucking idiot did with the frame; you can’t build It out without the tires rubbing because of a huge bend from a collision with a car and it was probably worth $300 brand new 15 years ago.
Many people living in this country are not  eligible  for stimulus checks or unemployment.  Many relied on a job in the back of a restaurant or Hotel while dodging ICE.  *(No judgement with my post.  Not trying to stirrup that fight. A member of my family came to this country illegally back in the 1920s.)*  With that said,  There are many people around us getting desperate.   If this lockdown last another billing cycle I expect looters and a crime spike. People will do what it takes to feed their family  Many of the businesses are boarding up windows. Is there a hurricane coming? no.
Lots have special rates for healthcare workers. Call them and ask
Mission announced it will pay for hotels for workers treating both diagnosed and suspected COVID-19 patients, including up to 5 days between shifts. Not sure which hotels those are.
Confirmed positive cases? I read this article a few days ago, and it was concerning: https://www.citizen-times.com/story/news/local/2020/04/03/nc-coronavirus-north-carolina-mission-hospital-treats-over-100-suspected-patients/2941436001/  Im not trying to be negative, and for whatever it’s worth, I think social distancing is helping tremendously. This could be a lot worse here, I’ve heard horror stories from people I know in NY.
As of last week 2 positive inpatients but 150 outstanding tests. Actually very low rate of positive tests from last couple weeks, but community testing numbers drive that down. Expected peak 3 weeks out. Lots of preparation at mission for expected surge. Lots of uncertainty.
Give it a few days for numbers to be reported. All signs point to a steep increase this week as outstanding tests come back.
I’ve heard 3 confirmed active cases currently admitted, 59 patients under investigation that could be currently infected.
There's a ACT article from 2 days ago that says there's over 100 at Mission. I'm taking the higher number.
It's awesome that we've kept it under control. Everyone has been great. But I think we still have a long way to go. Not to be negative, but one community honing it in isn't enough considering we aren't exactly shutting down the borders. It hasn't even begun to reach its peaks in the south and Florida, and once that happens, we may be danger again. But preventing a local outbreak is a great first step.
I do not know.  I would contact Pisgah Legal Services.  They will take the time to call you back and give free advice.
I had that issue to. I got approved in the state that I moved from though and they can combine the wages from multiple states. I would suggest having her file through that state and combined wages.
Nothing.  https://www.statnews.com/2016/03/02/donald-trump-vitamin-company/
Their the biggest demographic I've seen out and about not following protocol/distancing. Guess when you get past the age of giving a fuck it includes about everyone else.
From what I have been told Lowes also expressly forbids employees from wearing masks or PPE while on the clock. My wifes nephew delivers and installs appliances for Lowes in home. I wouldn't do his job for any amount of money right now.
Ingles as a company doesn't give two shits about their employees. They are doing even less in their TN stores because that state isn't coming down as hard as NC on everything. They are not providing anything for their employees as of right now regarding ppe.
WLOS news last night reported that within 2 weeks all Ingles stores will have plexiglass shields set up between check out cashiers and customers. Also mentioned one-way rule was in-place in some stores. These two reports here are not good indications that this is being followed. People can place themselves and others at great risk with such causal disregard.
I walked into the store not knowing the one way rule had been implemented, I swooped around the deli/bakery and turned to the first aisle I saw and saw the big signs at eye level saying that..  so I don't know how people missed it, but nothing surprises me.  Ingles needs to probably get better signs or maybe ones at the entrances of the stores to explain the system too, and not leave it up to employees to enforce it because you know that's a lose lose for the employee.
I am one of the people that didn't "see" the sign at first.  The problem is, they used the same paper that they put sales notices on.  Those things blend in when you are used to not reading them.  It would be better to have floor signs in the middle of each isle.
I think the idea that it's free is where the misconception of UBI comes in. It won't be free, it's coming from taxes, just that the taxes will be coming  from sources that were previously under taxed. Does  Spain have a GDP capable of sustaining it, that's a better question. If their citizens take advantage of the extra income and use it to improve themselves like the test in Canada suggested, then the income increase might be able to sustain the system. There's always going to be those who leech, but the overall focus on a safety net with minimal restrictions is going to have to be a focus if we don't want an economy that collapses at the slightest sign of trouble.
No downvotes, it's a reasonable premise. Hopefully they find a way to tax the right entities to make this viable long-term. TBD
Since Spain uses the Euro for currency that might keep inflation lower than if they were still on the Peseta. Other EU countries would probably temper rising costs for most items.
I don't think so; it's an old building so we don't have any air ventilation units (that I know of). Heat is radiator and there is no AC.
They'll do nothing or sell for .50 scrap.  They are lazy and stupid, that's why they are a thief, can't have one without the other.
Dude your post is a long-winded equivalent of "I'm not racist, but..." with an added twist of wild speculation about non-existent riots. Do everyone a favor and keep your opinion to yourself.
Maybe he was going the lawyer route and didn’t want to speak of presumptive positives, or maybe he was just trying to make us feel better. One nice thing, plenty of parking!
My father is completely brainwashed and Fox News poisoned (even though Fox News has backtracked weeks ago). He doesn't believe in it. I told him politely it would be good to hedge his bets just in case, and that people worry about him so he should be careful if only for their sake, and he ignored all my points talked about a communist conspiracy to take down Trump. It definitely had hints of dementia, which is really depressing for me.   I'm sure our average Asheville senior is not like this- my guess is they're just lonely, and getting a new plant or something to be excited about is worth it to them. Also, they may have other, more necessary things in the cart that weren't noticed.
I was in Lowe's and saw employees wearing masks
>Lowes also expressly forbids employees from wearing masks or PPE while on the clock.  That's actually surprising. They were always *huge* sticklers for PPE and safety when I was there, but they may have just thrown all that out the window now? Fuck *all* that noise.
Is that legal?
When the tax burden is high what stops the entities from leaving Europe?  Or better yet will the entities exist during the possible global depression?  This leads to printing money to cover UBI
Thank You.  That is the big concern too.   When the tax burden is high what stops the entities from leaving Europe? Or better yet will the entities exist during this global depression?
But yeah, I'm still pissed about it. It's stupid and irresponsible and puts all of us at risk.
Wow everyone is racist.  Great response.. snowflake
Nah dude they literally weren’t buying jack shit except two potted flowers. My eyes work pretty well. The store line was -backed up- with roughly a dozen people doing this. Seniors (and people) are stupid as hell everywhere, Asheville doesn’t create some magical exemption.
I stand corrected. I do not go there so you would know better than I would.
What entities will exist is a tough one to answer, most likely larger conglomerates. Either way, placing restrictions on who plays in Europe is easy. Don't like our taxes, you can't sell here.
Not everyone is racist, but you probably are. You also suck at proper ellipsis use. Oh, and snowflake is real creative and only further supports my assertion that you benefit society only through your silence.
See that's the downward spiral. A citizen is awarded UBI but is faced with possible inflation and less items to purchase.
You call them racist for stating a fact? Nothing about what they said was racist.  Illegal immigrants are being left out of a lot of the bills being passed to help people right now.  Illegal immigrants do rely on kitchen jobs and hotel jobs. Mainly because its easy to find work in those areas that dont care about their status as citizens.  They are stating facts on how this is effecting them. Literally nothing about what they said was racist.  Please tell me im racist while im lying here in bed with my Mexican husband.  You are a snowflake.
English is not my first language. You do not know my race or gender.  Nor do you know the race of undocumented people as a whole.  Your arrogance and ignorance precedes you.  Stop with the censorship you fascist
That was true in the past, but with substantial drives in automation, products have become relatively cheaper to produce. The investment returns and golden parachutes are what's keeping products high, not to mention the severe advertising campaigns. Product to event association has turned ridiculous.
That logic did not save Zimbabwe,South Sudan or Venezuela  Inflation is real regardless of advancements in automation.  If you TAX the rich they can always pack-up and leave.  And the printing of money is always tied to inflation.
You're comparing countries to a continent. That level of market share being left open would be something only a fool would ignore.  The rich are already packing up and leaving, which if they do the same to their property, brings in development possibilities on what is likely a sprawling acreage. Provide a model that works, you may get other countries on board.   The printing of money tied to this would be temporary as you'd only need enough to bring in the UBI however an allocation of funds from other social services would alleviate this as well. Any social programs tied to direct payment to individuals would be eliminated.  I'm not arguing with the basic logic that printing money ties to inflation, just that it's not a simple black and white. The system is complex, it needs to be treated as a complex organism. There are risks but dear god we're talking about making things better for the human race as a whole here. I'll sacrifice buying a PS5  if Joe Millionaire sacrifices his 3rd cocaine yacht  just so a single mother can afford daycare to go back to college so she can get a better job.
I have enjoyed this conversation
me too ;)
Same here, I enjoy talking to someone with a different viewpoint.

Coronavirus: Henderson COVID-19 cases double, assisted living outbreak

23 cases in the Cherry Springs Village,  assisted living community in Hendersonville.
I expect an extremely high death rate and contagion rate in Henderson county.  We are filled with retirees who have no immune system and major health issues.  Our retirement homes are way understaffed and underpaid.  We don’t have nearly enough room at our two hospitals either.  However, I’m curious how Asheville will fare with a for-profit hospital that is severely understaffed.  I could see a for-profit hospital “stabilizing” and releasing corona patients that don’t have insurance.

Only a comment, really: This morning seemed like almost as much traffic as "the before time".
Another beautiful day in the hood. Oakley-ite here. Things are quiet around here. I get out once a week or so for curbside pickup of groceries and supplies. Traffic is down, but still there. I still see groups of people, but I’m assuming (for my sanity) that they’re quarantining together and social distancing doesn’t apply. Wish I owned some axes and wood so I could throw axes in the front yard. Wish I owned Ultimate Ice Cream, so I could just have it. Stay sane(ish)!

Wondering if any other self-employed or Independent Contractor folks have applied for the SBA’s Disaster Loan (EIDL)? Having a hard time finding details.  Apparently the first $10,000 is a grant that does not have to be repaid, even if your application is ultimately denied.   We aren’t looking to go into even more debt over this, so curious if others have done this and their experiences. Can you just request a $10,000 loan/grant? TIA!

Still moving to Asheville from NYC en d of June. Not sure what states our rental truck plates will be from but please be gentle! This was in the cards long before COVID-19. GF and I are moving onto her families property in Candler and are super excited.

Does anyone know where I can find bread yeast? Both places I've tried have been out. Or, do you have a teaspoon of yeast I could either pay you for or trade you a homemade mask for? Social distancing will be followed!
That seems like a bummer for anyone either specifically looking for COVID-19 news, or avoiding it.  But you do you.
I actually was wondering if anyone knew of any new cases in Asheville or are we actually flattening the curve?
Is french broad river access still open?
I am thinking about vacaying in Ashevile in May. Worth still coming?  For whatever reasons hotel prices are still fairly expensive (>200 a night in downtown) I could only attribute that to that the demand is there and that people are coming into Asheville a lot still
We don't talk about The Before Times here.
The county refuses to admit that businesses they’re deeming essential aren’t actually essential. That would explain the traffic.

Check with White Labs Kitchen on Charlotte street. I think they’re selling their yeast.
Can only have two stickied posts at a time, and I think the unemployment one is important to be up there
The real answer is we don't know.  It's impossible to know how many are infected and whether the number is rising or falling when there is no widespread testing.  You still have to be desperately ill to get tested here.
After sitting at 33 cases for days, it went to 37 yesterday.   [Source](https://coronavirus.1point3acres.com/en)   Edited to insert link
Cases are being under reported nation wide. I believe cases are increasing but we are only counting lab confirmed cases while having a dearth of testing kits for confirmation testing. It gives the appearance of a flattening curve but I have a strong feeling we wont see that until late April. I don't know if it needs to be said but vaccinations aren't bad and the statistical risk and severity of adverse vaccination effects are infinitesimally small compared to the damage being un-vaccinated on a large scale can do to personal and social health. The loser that responded to you is brainwashed by alex jones conspiracy B.S.
Parking lots are closed off. Not sure if they are actively patrolling the river, but the intention is clear.

Until the stay at home is up in north carolina, do not come visit. It might be extended into may, it might not. If youre traveling from a hotspot and have been seeing others frequently, please do not come and risk spreading it.
Hard to say what May will be like and what businesses will be open. The general consensus you'll hear from the sub here is wait to travel until the pandemic is under control.
Look at this person’s account, they’re a fucking troll. Real people are actually still visiting Asheville right now though, which fills me with rage. I don’t hate the tourism that happens in Asheville but it’s quickly disenfranchising the people that are from WNC. Go back to Florida.
Tell me about it while I sit here in my company's office of manufacturing "essential" stuff. Morale is LOW.  I just meant that traffic seems to have picked up this morning in particular.

It's real, my brother and several friends are peddling this idea hard right now.
Our stay at home order was extended just this past Wednesday, but this time with no end date. The order is now “until further notice”.   Scroll down to page 10:  https://www.buncombecounty.org/common/health/4-8-20-Stay-Home-Guidance-Final.pdf  Hotels are currently banned from scheduling future travel for leisure.   There have been varying prediction models, but I believe the newest model shows a peak in about mid May.  Edit to add source about Asheville’s peak prediction:   “The county also assigned a new, later date for the expected peak with an estimated start time anywhere from April 23-May 21.”  From: https://www.citizen-times.com/story/news/local/2020/04/09/asheville-buncombe-coronavirus-passed-window-criticality-epidemic-not-ruled-out/5125205002/
There is a good chance that hotels are being booked up because locals with immunocompromised families need to distance themselves for a while, especially people who work in the medical field. Provided that some hotels have let up on their "no locals" rule, which I hope they have.  I would seriously question the ethics of a hotel taking vacation reservations right now.
Yawn. I don't like government. I detest blatant idiocy almost as much. The indefinite stay at home order sits unwell with me. I also make decisions to go out based on minimizing risk/contact and staying safe. This virus is real, not a hoax, but you don't have to capitulate to government to be careful. You think you can think critically but you have trained your mind in the worse possible ways. Maybe you will escape it. But you seem deep down the rabbit hole. Did you join the Q conspiracy yuppies yet. Its got to be JFK Jr. right?
What if I just want to stay in the hotel but go hiking in the mountains. I just booked the room anyways since it let me. I am not too concerned for covid since ashevile has a lot lower rate than where I am coming from.
That makes completely no sense. They would just stay home to get away from everyone, not get a room at the hotels. What are you smoking
>I am not too concerned for covid since ashevile has a lot lower rate than where I am coming from.  Re-read this and ask yourself why people in Asheville would like you to stay home.
The concern for people in Asheville is that you are potentially bringing sickness with you when you come from this "higher rate" area. Even if you just stay in your hotel and go hiking, you are potentially bringing sickness to the hotel, gas stations, restaurant workers, and/or grocery stores in Asheville. Then you could potentially carry sickness from Asheville back to your town. Just because you don't feel sick doesn't mean you aren't sick or can't carry it to other people.
Is this a joke? Please stay home.
If you are working during a pandemic in a medical facility and you have family at home who are compromised, say old or with pre-existing conditions, you might want to quarantine yourself in I don't know... a hotel to protect your family.
You are hopeless. You know scientists predicted years ago a virus like corona as originating from Chinese meat markets? It was well known they were dangerous areas for recombination of animal to human and vice versa vector viruses. It was not new information a virus could emerge. The problem being Covid-19 "Novel" corona virus is especially virulent with a long incubation time mixed with asymptomatic or minimal symptomatic infections, we were simply not prepared for it. It was not sold to china or given to them by wake forest scientists to be used as a bioweapon (I think that was last weeks conspiracy talking point). It was not man made and retrofitted with bits of herpes virus. I know you won't trust actually sources that do due diligence but I linked some below (one really enlightening one on why your bill gates BS is already heavily debunked and known as false). Stop listening to alex jones or whatever facebook sources you are getting his regurgitated talking points from, its not healthy. If you like podcasts give Knowledge Fight a listen. They actively debunk the talking points you are using from the source and tend to have good verifiable proof. Either that or keep being ignorant.   https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/bill-gates-vaccinations-depopulation/  https://www.politifact.com/article/2020/jan/24/fact-checking-hoaxes-and-conspiracies-about-corona/
This is why we can’t have nice things.
I do what I want when I want how I want. This is America
Doenst make any sense. Staying at the hotel would cost more than to work.
Eh, it’s not worth using evidence on conspiracy theorists. (You likely already know that.) They respond by doubling down and insisting that anyone who dismisses their views are uncritical, mindless sheep. Quite frankly, their choice of wording and selected responses are predictable.
You are cancer. I hope this is a joke.
Then why even ask us if its worth it to come here? Be considerate of other people and stay the fuck home.
Whatever buddy. Deflect to save your world view. Never challenge it. Stay delusional. Reductive talking to you.
Wth wrong with you? I am coming to ashevile not to interact with the people there but to go enjoy the nature
I didnt ask for permission. I asked what's the scene like over there. Like restaurants and what not. Do you have comprehension problems?
The nature will still be here when all of this is over.
**You** obviously have comprehension problems.  No restaurants open except for *some* no-contact take-out. Many of our restaurants will likely go bankrupt because of this. No "what not"s are open. No antique malls, no strolling around town looking for fun around the corner. There is no scene.  No music, no bars, no brew pubs. Some are accepting take-out, but there is no hanging out.  No parks open. Gates and/or police tape at every one.  This is an executive order.  We're essentially closed. Even the Biltmore estate is closed.   I don't know what you're not getting about this?
No because I have an upcoming week furloughed in May so I am going to use that week to go. I cant just go on vacay whenever I want to...
That is my question... to what extent are "some" restaurants open for biz (take out) I cant talk to stupid. Bye
But I thought this was America, where you do what you want, when and how you want?
Heh, heh.

Shout out to Taqueria Muñoz on Patton for donating 50 hot meals to Beloved to feed people in poverty. They're open for take-out, they're good people, they have good authentic Mexican food, and it's probably some of the cheapest local food you can get in Asheville. Consider supporting! (Not an employee, just a fan. I recommend the chicken tamales).
That was a hell of a storm last night.
Does anyone know where to find hand sanitizer? My wife and I really need some, she is an essential worker. I have not had any luck at any of the grocery stores. I have heard about some breweries and distilleries around the country making some, anyone know of any around here?
Anyone else surprised we didn’t wake up in Oz?
No power at my house in Swannanoa, went out about 12:30am so it’s been out 11 hours now. No estimate from Duke about when it will be back on. Other outages they have been good about giving an estimate and frequent updates. Not this time.   I worked at Mission last night and just really want a shower. We have a well with an electric water pump :(  Edit: finally back on about 12:15pm. Best shower everrr
Pisgah forest is shut down and I am officially getting the cabin fever
I'm in the mood for jerky. Are there any local makers that I can support, or at least local vendors that sell smaller brands jerky?
I was so counting on the stimulus check to pay rent to the **Complex Management Overlords** this month, and of course the IRS deposited it yesterday to an old/closed Secu account. :(  Even though I did update my new direct deposit info.    Called and asked secu to reroute it to my savings account that appears to still be open.. and was told a quick “no”. So, this sucks. I guess I’m stuck in the crowd of those that will have to wait for a paper check?? I am not even sure what to do about rent, as I just barely managed to get groceries and pay utilities.   What a mess.
Ive got to imagine that the issue with repairing power lines during a storm, is that they have to wait for the storm to pass? Otherwise the linemen are facing danger as well?
I've been doing a lot of yard work stuck at home and have a giant brush pile at my curb and a dozen bagged lawn and leaf bags. I understand City of Asheville yard waste collection is suspended, but they are supposed to resume limited collection using the claw truck to pick up large brush piles. A couple of questions if anyone knows...  Is the claw truck coming on normal brush collection days, or just randomly and has anyone seen it?  Can I drop off my bagged leaf bags somewhere myself?  Or will the claw truck take my paper leaf bags?  Thanks in advance, I've called the city a few times but only get a voicemailbox that is not returned.
I'm on Brevard Rd and our power is still out. RIP my groceries I just bought
I've been listening to local industrial/electronic musician [Kangarot](https://kangarot.bandcamp.com/) lately, which I had kind of forgotten about for a while. Also Grouper (not local).   Anyone else find anything interesting or unique to listen to lately?   Any local bands doing anything interesting?
Totally slept through the rain and wind. Bit of a bummer, since I enjoy intense storms.
Looking for the best place to get CBD right now. I’m not sure what’s open.

Power is back in Woodfin
Lost power in Oakley at 2am. No estimation of when it'll be back on.    I've never lived somewhere where the electricity goes out and for such a long time. Feels like every spring/summer we have an outage that lasts 12-24 hours.
We just had a super low flyby in Swannanoa at 12:05 a.m. It sounded like it was going to land right on us.
Are any of the vape shops open during this?
I love Taqueria Muñoz. I love their shredded chicken tamales! I don't eat cheese but LOVE tamales so it's nice to find a dairy free option. I didn't know they were open for takeout! And definitely cheap! 2 tamales for $5. I often load up and get six tamales to eat later.
So it's over? I thought my clover sprouts would wash away, instead they doubled in size.   I have weird priorities, I know.
The Chemist in South Slope Tues-Sat 2-6pm
I made my own. 3/4 denatured alcohol from the hardware store and 1/4 cheap lotion from the grocery store. Not the greatest in terms of smell and feel, but it works.
Eda Rhyne distillery is making hand sanitizer. You can get it for free at the distillery, not sure if you have to buy the liquor too but I don't think so

If you don't have luck, reach out to me via DM. I've decided to clean out a stash I have of the BBW products, since they're needed in this time and I don't \*need\* to collect them. <3
I'm just surprised I didn't wake up with a tree in my living room.
Indeed, I moved here to see the beautiful wilderness, and now I can't go to any of it. I can still walk by the highway and see some mountains, so I've got that going for me which is nice.
Update: a truck came through today (a day after my normal pick up) and got all the bagged/canned yard waste in the neighborhood and the claw truck was an hour behind it and got my brush pile. I didn't get my bagged yard waste picked up because the city had said it wasn't picking that up so I didn't put it out, dammit.
I’ve seen it randomly in my neighborhood. They did pick up my neighbors paper leaf bags last week when they swung by and some stacked brush they could grab with the claw.
My brush got picked up this morning (Malvern Hills).
Sold all my Grouper records to pay rent, but that was last year. Currently listening to Lez Rallizes Denudes.

I've rediscovered my love of Dirty Three.  It's Warren Ellis and two other guys, if you dig his film scores.
I'm not fan of the damage and flooding but I love storms and the rain. Wish we were having more.
Dispensary across from the west Avl library is still open...
Trinity pharms in black mtn is still shipping.  Best CBD bud around and a very quick shipment.
Just ordered from Frannys for the first time. I had it 2 days later which was nice.
Carolina Hemp Company is open check out their website, good deals to come later this monday
Violet Owl Wellness delivers. Tip well her well pls
So Franny's CBD is available via mail?
Also, many are anti-vexers. How will they work it out to avoid Covid-19 vaccine, when there is one? This ain't measles.
Lost it about 5 am in Woodfin, same on estimate.   E: check this out  WLOS: Duke Energy crews adapt to social distancing guidelines during severe weather preparations. http://wlos.com/news/local/duke-energy-crews-adapt-to-social-distancing-guidelines-during-severe-weather-preparations
It's so weird how all over the place it is. We've lived in Oakley for 11 years now, and I think we've lost power maybe twice?
I've seen it at aldi, Walmart, ingles, and whole foods all over in East Asheville over the last trips made to each.
That's funny, I also love their chicken tamales because I don't eat dairy!
I eat cheese but not meat, and no options for me :-(  Just figured I’d comment here to save a couple minutes for anyone in a similar boat.
Yeah looks like it's passed through.
Take a bike onto the Blue Ridge Parkway it’s quite a treat with no vehicles
We're finally back on full power!
Dirty Three are great. Haven't listened in a while. Looks like they have 3 albums I haven't heard yet. Thanks!
Thanks for the suggestions everyone! I ended up going with Hutch Mountain Farms. I’ve never tried them before but they’re a WNC company, have a BOGO deal right now and free shipping.
Trader Joe's had it yesterday when I was there
After some of the rainstorms I've experienced here, my response is 'that's it?' But it really was coming down hard at certain points and the bucket on my porch has 8 inches of rain in it, so it must have been intense.

Coronavirus: Buncombe reports 3rd death due to COVID-19

So Buncombe county's mortality rate is nearly 8%. Besides reporting fuck all, wtf is going on here?
Buncombe counties mortality rate isn't 8% it's less than 1% same as everywhere else.  More than half the people that get the Rona will recover without even knowing they had it, literally no symptoms.  The rest will have symptoms ranging between a slight cold all the way to full blown Rona with ~10% requiring some form of medical intervention.    Lack of testing is what causes the numbers to look like that. Not really much to be done about it, the tests don't exist in enough supply to get the real number of infected.
>38 confirmed cases - 3 deaths = roughly 8%  Way to push your fear mongering narrative.  I've made up nothing, I am capable of looking at fact.  No, we don't know the real number but we have educated guesses based on places that tested 100% of the population.  [Here's one](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/24/us/diamond-princess-cruise-ship-asymptomatic-tests/index.html) [And here's another](https://www.newsweek.com/coronavirus-mass-testing-experiment-italian-town-covid-19-outbreak-1493183?amp=1#aoh=15869169429620&referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com&amp_tf=From%20%251%24s) do I need to continue on to get you the rest of the numbers I used? Honestly doesn't matter at this point I'm convinced you are a bad actor who wants to spread fear and misinformation as wide as you can.
You're just making numbers up? Why? What the fuck is wrong with you?   Dude you have major issues I don't know why you want to fear monger but you need to stop. It's fucking wrong and you should be ashamed of yourself.

COVID-19 outbreak at North Carolina prison grows over 250
https://wlos.com/news/local/covid-19-outbreak-at-north-carolina-prison-grows-over-250
"and that 98% of those testing positive were asymptomatic."  That seems unusual
This is very worrisome, considering the way the viral load impacts the victim, and the way our prisons disproportionately incarcerate minorities; right now, the virus appears to kill twice as many of our black fellows.
Substitute "asymptomatic" with "pre-symptomatic" and it makes more sense.
So you're saying if I go to prison I have access to testing...
Not necessarily. The [LA antibody study](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.14.20062463v1?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=be77753b5f9c509cb865d14fbdaf97eeb78e11d5-1587139595-0-AWIUFx6wN0uXOvkl2GvKJJc-Ig8sPLjxRzO454lTi9KpWYjKbxnVGQzEHGD9bYZUKYUUOdrfRQ_wQREzNDVmpdEWVIZYt6UTI9m_LD7byikYQA-loXE677ZRO1gHfKAz7mccB9JD5q3Y8YVehLtYCxNulZzxgq75-rzgoHZ2Heyj5PDAftyTcJ9j-gS_9XvqhP1w_lcrCrvVy9EM4vDfOYSqAiDYODT4O2PXN776dtAuibDok5gMCdzZYcCoRi69cdjoFoqV7X4-dhUOTFhjUA5EzGIOpkN7fsqrkufnBv0pOXqb3nOUoVRFDs5ZdBzO9w_yicdwyhIdvht3lBZyMgA) would actually support that being the case. They found case counts were off by somewhere between 50x and 80x (not percent!).
Nope that's how this virus works.
This guy knows a lot about viral loads.
Agreed
I won't deny there's a lot of asymptomatic carriers out there but that just seems much higher than I would have expected. Do you think they'll become symptomatic as time progresses?
gal :)
For those who didn't see my reply on the other link:  Boston area study showing nearly 1/3 randomly selected individuals had antibodies as well, and it used a different test.
> you linked Stanford study, not the LA county study  The study was conducted in LA. Additionally, you also have the Boston area study showing nearly 1/3 randomly selected individuals had antibodies as well, and it used a different test. The LA County study confirms that fact as well. This then confirms that the numbers are way off as far as infections, but this is a good thing. It means that the outbreak is nowhere near as bad as we thought.
Yeah, most of them still won't show symptoms but best guesses put asymmetric rate at somewhere between 50 and 60%, I'd expect jails and prisons have a lower average age than the outside world (I can't find numbers unfortunately) so the asymmetric rate might be higher than the normal rate.
Someone on the internet said it!  It's gotta be true!!  /s
Sorry it’s so hard to tell with you antifa types.
Those numbers sound more realistic but my guess would be the asymptomatic rate would be lower. Virul load seems to make a difference considering so many health care workers are being severely infected, and jails and prisons are pretty close corridors from what I know. I also have a hard time believing inmates get all those essential vitamins and minerals, and wouldn't be surprised if they had weaker immune systems than most, but then again that may be giving to much credit to the average american diet.
I'm sorry, does this mean you advocate for fascism?
It's really sad, I feel this pressure to just stop posting here. Y'all are so unkind to me.  Edit: I am a human being; I have feelings.
Whatever you say, boomer
So you're pro fascism?
No I didn't.  You need to stop fear mongering.  I know your old ass is in the high risk category and rich enough for this not to be a issue financially, but most of us aren't.  Stay your fucking ass home and get the fuck off r/coronavirus that place is a toxic fear mongering mess and is doing nothing good for you sanity.
Good lord, I feel you. It's like a viper pit anymore. Some of our neighbors are truly not kind. It makes me sad, too.
Says the antifa
I know, and I do. I'm just going to stop posting here, every time I comment or post here I have to brace myself when I check my messages.
What the fuck is wrong with being anti-fascist? I sure the fuck am.
I have no idea what that even means. I'm a hermit, and I can tell that it means anti-fascist, and I've looked at an article or two. Leave me alone.  Edit: and of course I'm against fascism. Who isn't??
Apparently you're the fucking expert on this thing tell me exactly how many a systematic people there are.. Please explain why I'm wrong.    Just because you have nothing to lose by staying home for 2 months doesn't mean the rest of us do I wish you would stop fear-mongering and let us get on with our lives.
Don't spend any more energy on this person.  At best they are a fool, and at worst some kind of Fascist troll.  Do not suffer fools.
Guess what I don't give a single fuck about the virus, absolutely none. I'm far more worried about people's livelihoods.  You seem to be rich enough not to give a shit, most of use aren't.  You're dismissing a fucking huge part of this that's probably going to affect use more than the virus just going rampant.    Here's some proof that points to half.   Half of the population at a homeless center in Boston tested positive for antibodies with none exhibiting symptoms.   https://edition.cnn.com/2020/04/17/us/boston-homeless-coronavirus-outbreak/index.html  56% of the patients at nursing home in Zurich didn’t show symptoms.   https://twitter.com/mhermann_/status/1250750948911316994?s=21  An antibody test from Ortisei, Italy shows 49% of the sample tested positive and 66% had no symptoms.  https://twitter.com/luciomm1/status/1251476961886699521?s=21  These are just from the past few days
There’s also [Iceland](https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/01/europe/iceland-testing-coronavirus-intl/index.html) and the [Diamond Princess](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/24/us/diamond-princess-cruise-ship-asymptomatic-tests/index.html)
That link from Co is showing excess false negatives not positives.    Like I get it we should be testing but the tests aren't there, and these lockdowns can't last forever.  Just look at all the protests people are getting feed up with this.
Where did you get any idea that the Co case has false negatives? Maybe I didn't read it well enough but it said nothing about them. Unless you're calling the inderminate as negatives, but that would just be silly call them what they unknowns.  As for the Sandford test, so what? So many models have been wrong at the point. But some of our best closed environments are showing upwards of 50% [the Theodore Roosevelt](https://www.businessinsider.com/testing-reveals-most-aircraft0-carrier-sailors-coronavirus-had-no-symptoms-2020-4) is yet another on that list.    Of course all this is irrelevant the big question is, how long do you expect people to stay locked up for? There's already protests, wouldn't it be smarter to lockdown the at risk demos instead of the entire population?

Rep. Ilhan Omar Introduces Bill to Cancel All Rent and Mortgage Payments During the COVID-19 Pandemic

Oh, this thread should be fun.   *Gets his popcorn*
Just like basically everything else the squad tries to push. This will go nowhere.
Let's cancel all Federal and State Tax for everyone.   It's a real burden.
And the banks that are holding the notes on these mortgages are supposed to just... what? Absorb the debt? Hope that the federal government will bail them out? With what money? Were mass foreclosures so fun ca. 2008 that we can’t wait to take the updated, more “thrilling” version of that ride again?   I’m by no means some banking/financial industry apologist, and I wholeheartedly believe that our economic system is fucked and due for some serious rejiggering, but like it or not, it’s the economic system we have at this very moment. And it’s one in which the banking industry is inextricably enmeshed and plays a huge and crucial role.   So perhaps it would be prudent to pause for one moment and think the above proposal through, all the way, before jumping on the bandwagon.
The bums lost Lebowski the bums lost
Cancel rent??? Mortgages arent canceled; they’re postponed at best..  Why doesnt she propose the government pay landlords for rent directly?? They’re paying for every one/thing else...
Yeah but she is set pay her new husbands firm 1 million dollars after paying his firm over 500k while she was cheating on him with her last husband.   Some people just love corruption and will vote for it no questions asked as long as it’s a Democrat   https://news3lv.com/news/nation-world/congresswoman-ilhan-omar-on-track-to-pay-new-husbands-company-over-1-million
So if I keep paying my mortgage does this mean than I will also be paying other people's canceled' rent in the form of taxes?  Why can't everyone else in America pay my mortgage for me?
I don't get why more people weren't saying this a month ago. Idk about *cancelling* payments, but I don't see why we can't pause all car/mortgage/rent/CC payments, and just make the term of the loan however many months longer that we end up pausing everything.   That way we don't need ginormous $8 trillion stimulus packages or whatever.
Huh [I wonder why that is](https://mediaproxy.salon.com/width/1200/height/900/https://media.salon.com/2020/01/mitch-mcconnell-donald-trump-0121201.jpg).
Income taxes are unconstitutional and should have never been implemented in the first place.  End the Federal Reserve and Income Taxes immediately.
When I make my mortgage payment to the bank, what do they do with it? Do they have to make a payment?
This is one of the reasons why this will never pass.  Not every landlord is a bank. They cant pass a bill thats telling individual landlords "oh your not going to get paid for the next fews months...hope you have another way of paying your bills".  Also like half the dumbshit the dems are trying pass theres other things included that she knows wont pass. Cancelling deportations, funds for states to buy property, and stimulus checks for illegal immigrants.
I mean there are other bills that can't be deferred, that the stimulus package does help people pay.  But I completely agree with the rest of your comment. Any loans or payments of that nature could be deferred and it would benefit both the people who make the payments AND the banks...  Because banks make a lot more money from the people who pay their loans off (no matter the length)  through the interest the gain as opposed to foreclosing on someone's house and then having to potentially sell it for less than what they originally issued the loan for.   Deferring payment for a few months and then tacking on a few months to the end of the loan seems like something that should've been done a month ago..and it's something that atleast I have been saying for a month or longer.
Because its stupid policy.  You only see "free rent" you dont see that the bill also includes a halt to deportations and funds to go to the government to buy private property.   They keep adding shit to push their political motives. Its no different then the cares act where they tried holding it up to add laws to regulate furl consumption of airplanes and laws to force diversity in the work place.  Those things have no business being discussed right now. In a pandemic where people are losing jobs and businesses they care more about identity politics.  You have MI governor who just passed a task force that will cost hundreds of thousands to tackle the "racial implications of the virus" because somehow the virus is racist and hate black people. And during a pandemic its important to waste money on that while your people are jobless and starving.
Yes
These are just late night ideas.  If we're contemplating free rent and mortgages  why not contemplate other ideas too.  Why should politicians have a paycheck while forcing people not to work?  The $1200 stimulus checks should come from their salary not the printing presses.  Stop taxing the workers.  That would be a better "stimulus"  in my situation.
How do you think the government is funded you fucking retard?  By taxes, that's how states and the federal government get income  no taxes = no state or federal services  Did everyone fail to tax a civics course in school
 In the 1770s people protested against taxes.  In 2020 people protest *for* taxes.   Shrug.  We might be alone in that fight to end the Federal Reserve and Income Taxes
You must have missed the part where I said,  > Hope that the federal government will bail them out? With what money?
> Do they have to make a payment?   Are you serious? Is this a real question? What do the banks do with your mortgage payment? Do they have to make a payment??? To whom?  Of course not. They’re the LEND-ers. They lend you the money (in the most basic terms) needed to buy your home. In return, they earn interest on the repayment of that loan, and they use those earnings to extend credit to other customers - and pay shareholders and salaries and business expenses - again, I’m distilling this down to the banks’ most basic, simplistic functions. So I guess, yes, technically, they make payments. Sometimes. Not right now, obviously. But it’s a different kind of payment. I’m assuming you understand that.   So, back to Rep. Omar, here comes proposed legislation that would allow everyone to default on their mortgages without penalty as long as the Corona crisis continues. It’s not like I don’t get where that impulse comes from and why that sounds like a good and fair deal, at least on an emotional level, but like I said, I think it’s worth taking a moment to think this through and ask some questions.   For example: Where would this leave banks? You said in another comment that “banks have plenty of money”, which may be true at this exact moment in time (but certainly not as much as they had 2 months ago). But what you’re missing is a lot of that money is, uh, banking on people repaying their debts, including mortgages. And if property owners are given the legal go-ahead to default, that “plenty of money” the banks have will very quickly turn to “no money”, because a lot of that money (aka, assets), at least when it comes to mortgages, is in the form of collateral (real property), the value of which is sure to tank along with the rest of our economy. And what happens then? When banks have no more money to lend?   JFC, people, we just went through this like 10 years ago! Have we learned nothing?   (Don’t answer that. It was rhetorical. Clearly we have learned nothing.)  I had optimistically, and naively, hoped we would have addressed these iniquities and instabilities in our economic system, oh, say, roughly four years ago, when we had the chance. But we didn’t. Instead, we elected to take a path that just compounded the preexisting problems and left us even weaker and more vulnerable than we were pre 2008.  And it is from this weakened position that we are left to confront a global pandemic that does not merely impact one economic market, but every market and every facet of our lives, and not just nationally, but globally. In other words, who are you expecting to buy our debt - as we have relied on other countries to do thus far - when the global economy is just as fucked as ours? (No need to answer that one, either, it was also rhetorical).   So, to reiterate my original point, there’s nothing to lose - and perhaps something to gain - from just pausing for a moment and thinking this through, before reflexively jumping on the “Fuck the landlords and the banks!” bandwagon.   TL;DR: We reap what we sow.
Holy shit!!  Do you know understand how the banking system works?
I'm glad you answered this very reasonable question. Well a lot of mortgages are bundled into securities and sold as investments to retirement accounts. Here is a scenario:  You pay your rent -> landlord pays their morgage, taxes, and upkeep -> bank pays the bond -> bond pays a retirement fund -> retirement fund pays retiree -> retiree pays their mortgage -> bank pays the bond, etc. etc.      If you think that your landlord is rolling around in a pile of money like scrooge mcduck, that isn't how it works.   Omar is the dumbest member of congress. Thanks Minnesota.
See I disagree with the entire idea of this bill, it’s unamerican and unconstitutional... How can someone introduce a bill to cancel all rent payments? That’s the government interfering with a legally binding private contract between two agreeing parties?   The cancel of mortgage payments is not fair, no bank is going to cancel payments they will just tack it onto the end of the term. Most people that rent have no concept of what it takes to upkeep a property and there is monthly costs outside of a “mortgage”.. what about people who owe no mortgage? How does this help them by effectively the government mandating they receive no compensation for letting people effectively squat in their buildings?  This entire bill is in direct violation of the 5th Amendment (read the whole amendment, it isn’t just about the right to remain silent) it’s the government forcing people to have their private property being taken from them for public use without just compensation.   Now onto citizens united... Yeah I don’t like it but at the same time people on the left use citizens united because the case stems from a movie made about dear leader who never was Hillary. To think unlimited money wasn’t allowed in politics before this case is some whimsical view of how the world should work... make any politician who cries about citizens united to only be allowed to run with the public funding option or stfu about it..  The deal with Omar is she is once again using a marriage scam (I won’t mention the other one) to her advantage to enrich herself skirting FEC rules by literally paying her husband her campaign funds that weren’t intended to be used for that purpose which has nothing to do with citizens untied, it’s just blatant in your face corruption and she just laughs in people’s faces about it.
What you said is true, though I would not agree that it is in our collective interest to keep (some) of these businesses. The whole point of capitalism is supposed to be if a business gets to bogged down and heavy, and can't keep up then it dies. And new, more limber businesses fill the gaps. However, we have reached a point where we don't allow that to happen anymore. I believe that stifles growth and innovation.   I would argue that if a big business like Boeing's fundamentals are so poor that they can't survive a few months without billions and billions of taxpayers money as a handout (meanwhile every day Americans are out of work and wondering how their $1200 hush money is going to pay for rent, food, medicine and bills) then maybe we shouldn't prop them up anymore.   It's raw capitalism for normal people, and socialism for Big Business (except the profits, they keep those).
Wow, I am shocked that people actually believe this.  The Fed can print money, but they cannot create wealth out of nowhere.  If the government gives out wealth in any form, that means that it is taking wealth from Americans somehow.
You really should have a look into how the virus is adversely affecting blacks in urban areas before critiquing these policy decisions:   https://www.economist.com/united-states/2020/04/11/covid-19-exposes-americas-racial-health-gap  This is a very real phenomenon that has exposed an underlying systemic issue. I wouldn’t call it “wasting money” if we are trying to help those most vulnerable who themselves are sick, “jobless and starving.” Is that so bad? To ignore their predicament is dishonest and recklessly impetuous.
Wow another brilliant profanity stream from an arrogant fool.  The current system and proposed stimulus packages will be funded mainy by deficit spending = the ol' printing press. There is not enough taxes to pay for all this madness.  I would be pleased to see these politicians take a temporary pay cut. This would limit the amount of deficit spending needed to fund the proposed "stimulus packages"    If these political idiots were faced with pay cuts perhaps they would reconsider shutting down the entire country.  Furthermore I would rather opt out of this stimulus package nonsense and simply not pay taxes during this pandemic  The $1200 check is not free.  We will all pay this back via inflation (the invisible tax) in the coming years.  We will pay back $3000+ theoretically.  It's just a crappy payday loan wrapped in cheap bow.
The federal government will just throw it on their credit cards. No biggie.
So what’s the problem with the banks not getting money right now? I don’t have a solution, but this is better than any other I’ve heard. Banks have plenty of money. If we’re not allowed to work right now but still pay our mortgages, we’re just transferring the little wealth we might have over to the banks.
95%?? You just throwing that out there? Lol You really believe that? You know how many portfolio lenders there are? Private lenders? Hard money lenders?  None of these connect to Fannie/Freddy. I doubt they only make up 5%.
2007 was due to foreclosure and inverse leveraged securities based on lousy mortgages.   Forcing banks to accept no fee deferrments is probably greatly preferable to letting a lot individual borrowers default. To keep it fair and damage minimal, you could cap the mortgage amount at say 750k.
Yeah it was an actual question. The fact that you have to be a dick about it is exactly why we haven’t learned. No one wants to listen to a dick. When you act like that you everyone stops listening, no matter how right you may be.   So what is the problem with putting everything on pause? If we don’t we will have many more poor people very soon. Lots of homeless people.   My business will burn through our emergency fund in 4 more months (and we will for sure because there will be no concerts for at least 6 months). So most likely we will go bankrupt and lose everything.   Personally I will go through my emergency fund as well. What then? What do you suggest I do with my children when I am foreclosed on?  Edit: and please don’t tell me to apply for the jokes that they called small business loans, they’re all gone. And even if they fund it again there won’t be enough for everyone.
Yes. That’s my point. The bank technically owns my house. They’ve been bailed out before, so why not the rest of us now
Apparently lots of people hate the bill of rights
The virus doesnt care about ones skin color. It has nothing at all to with race.  Turning it into a race thing is just asinine. You want to put together resources for lower income people and bad areas? Great. Dont turn it into a race thing.  Because there race has nothing to do with it.
They can't provide services without income, what part of that aren't you grasping  If you stop paying your local and state taxes all together, do you know what happens?  Police, fire departments, etc SHUTDOWN!!  They don't work for free, if the city can't pay them they get furloughed  If they federal government doesn't have any money, it shutdowns
What services have they not provided?
Yep, sadly people on here are tenants and don’t know about these financing options... they only know car loans and personal loans instruments...  They don’t know about HML, or jumbo, or portfolio loans, or ballon payments... they think owning a house is as simple as walking into a bank and getting a “mortgage” when they have no clue that “investment” loans carry a higher interest rate and a bigger down payment unlike a house you intend to live in for 20 years
Deferment is different than “cancel”, which is what the title says. “Deferment” is what’s happening anyway, organically, out of necessity. So why would we need to *force* - i.e. legislate -  landlords and banks to defer payments? They don’t really have a better option at this point.
TARP was the federal government buying equity from failing companies to leverage future lending and ensure they had ample liquidity when things recovered. These funds were issued as loans and not directly giving corporations billions of dollars. We got all that money back with interest. It certainly wasn’t perfect and we could’ve gone further in preventing massive foreclosures/ possibly nationalizing those banks however it prevented a global financial catastrophe.   It’s a lot harder to target relief efforts to normal Americans because it’s not exactly securities we’re dealing with. We should be doing some serious deficit spending but endless cyclical policy has prevented surpluses for a rainy day like this.
OML  The federal government isn't funded by leprechauns....so there is magical pot of money just sitting there to save all these businesses  Local, State and the Federal government, generate money through taxes and issuing bonds and the federal government can also issue treasury bills  taxes come from people and businesses bonds are sold to investors and individuals treasuries are generally sold to other countries  If people aren't working and businesses are running, that means they're not generate tax revenue, meaning the government can't get paid  Do you understand how that works?
It's not every day that I agree with Arealoldashevillan, but it really doesn't matter where the loan "originates" as they almost all end up being handed off to some bank or another within a few months.
True story you have a basic bitch understanding of banking and lending around mortgage loans...  Banks are the originators of loans which is why they make money off the origination fees and make sure your loan type is conforming to the FHA guidelines that the govt will back which allows for these loans to be sold on the secondary market, it doesn’t mean Freddie/Fannie will simply buy every defaulted loan. You don’t even understand how a conventional home loan works, so I won’t go into more difficult commercial loans... there are limits to these “conventional” loans otherwise you need to find private lenders (mortgage brokers) to get financing or find a bank that will keep your loan “in house” and keep the loan on their balance sheet and not push it off on the secondary market which is what most banks do, because they’re in the business of lending money not the real estate business...  Your an idiot who knows nothing in-depth other than some pseudo intellectual who thinks the Government can just step in and purchase all the loans in default and everything would be ok
I think so, since mortgage investors would ultimately be the ones needing to get paid, and mortgages are backed by the government. I found this comment super helpful in explaining the situation and how things line up: https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/g44gn3/proposed_2000_monthly_stimulus_checks_and/fnvx51k/
First off, did you even read the article? Please read it, the Economist is one of the most unbiased sources you can find.   Of course the virus doesn’t care about skin color. It is the virus taking advantage of infective people who are particularly exposed or unable to get treatment. In this case, urban blacks unfortunately seem to fit the bill. I don’t understand your hostility towards helping people who need it. If some group was obviously being adversely affected, and there is evidence of that, why ignore it? Native American reservations have also been severely hit by and unable to cope with this disease. If a task force was launched to help these groups, would you also take issue with that?  You talk about race like it’s some taboo that we ought to speak quietly about. Ignoring race in a country with a strongly racial history allows these problems to grow and fester.
Exactly. There are very few possible solutions.
Better if you aren't a landlord and this is your main source of income. Yes. I see the piece about the relief fund. You also saw how the paycheck protection fund already ran out of money? Sorry if this makes me a bit nervous. Not that I want my tenants to get fucked by all this either. It will be very easy for the government to say they don't have to pay rent anymore  I just have little faith in the relief fund working like they say for landlords ... Which would be catistrophic for someone like me and my family of four.  I would love a solution that helps us all. Believe me. I just have shit for faith in our government to get a damn single thing done right. That's all.
Why on Earth would you assume folks here don't own homes?  Weird flex.
I do. Do you have a solution to this problem that doesn’t involve me losing my business, my house and putting my family on the street? Even though I have a 6 month emergency fund for both my family and my business, that’s what is going to happen.
misspelling you're while calling someone an idiot. classic.
Its playing identity politics for no reason.  I have no problem helping any area. Point is race doesnt play a factor.   You want to target areas that are low income with bad health care. In fine with that. The race of that area means nothing. If the black people in that area were another race they would be in the same exact position.   https://www.clickondetroit.com/news/local/2020/04/20/governor-signs-executive-order-creating-michigan-coronavirus-task-force-on-racial-disparities/  Task force like the one in michigan are trying to play the race card. The task force goals should have nothing to do with ones skin color. Id feel the exact same way if it was towards any race as well.
Given the limited resources and manpower they’ve done the best they can. The initial response to shutter businesses and issue stay at home orders should’ve been swifter however I’d say we’re doing well to flatten the curve so that this peaks in April/ downward trend through the summer.
People don’t care about landlords... they all assume all landlords are swimming in cash and canceling “mortgage” payments is somehow saving landlords.... which doesn’t include landlords who don’t have a w2 and don’t have “mortgage” payments but they have no problem letting people squat in your buildings until July
yeah its called re-open all the businesses
Wow thanks for using the oldest argument on the internet... hahahaha see you had incorrect spelling and grammar.... idgaf
I have some many other bills besides mortgage. So yes you are right. Lol along with the fact that it helps us out food on the table! So yeah.  If be fine with this if it was done correctly. No problem. Great. Let's help each other out. Always. But I just know it won't unfold like that. So it gets my chest all tight and my tummy all knotted up instead.
“Holy shit” “OML”. Do you not know how science works?
I’m discussing the state response. I completely agree the federal government has been incredibly inept and deeply incompetent.

This 2020 spring has been the most lovely in many years; a mix of sunny glory, rainy gloom, and suprise cold mornings. I feel like we've shifted from Winter directly to summer for the last few years; this is a nice gift.
Home Depot on Patton a TOTAL shitshow. One of the cashiers at the returns desk was looking visibly sick and then in the middle of a transaction declared “I am sick and I can’t breathe” and just walked off the job right in front of me. I shit you not. She wasn’t masked, nor were any other employees and only a few customers. her coworkers looked terrified. STAY AWAY
What are some skills you wish you had now that you’re in lockdown?  I wish I knew how to cut my own hair and grow my own weed.
COVID-19 testing is now available at Mercy Urgent Care.  The short version is that you schedule a telemedicine visit and are referred for testing from your car.  At this time, testing is not recommended for those with no symptoms.  See their website for details.    https://mercyurgentcare.org/news/information-regarding-covid-19/
So covid-19 hits local governments hard financial...but someone in Asheville decided to move up the timetable on Charlotte street redo..... Unsure this is wise, seems like this should be placed on hold  https://www.facebook.com/213405826952/posts/10157811233461953/
Does anyone know somewhere that reuses glass growlers? We have been collecting a bunch throughout quarantine.
Where is the best place to buy mature rhododendrons, and how much? I lost a few 8'ers in the last storm when a tree came down on them and want to replace without waiting 10 years for small ones to fill in the gaps. Jesse Israel is the only place I've checked but they only have small ones
Anyone know how long the parkway is supposed to be closed? When it was still open it was a good way to stay sane while still socially distancing
Anyone hear any updates on gyms,fitness centers reopening next month?
Is there any way to get a haircut from a professional these days?!
Yes! It's been so nice. Never too hot, never too cold, birds singing in the morning. For all the springs to be forced to stay at home and slow down, this is a good one.
Agreed, it's been ridiculously beautiful here this spring. Excellent gardening weather!!
I’ve lived in states where there isn’t much spring. Last time I got to enjoy spring was ten years ago when I lived in Philly.    Everyday we look out at the beauty of the blossoming trees and flowers and it brings us so much joy. Such simple pleasures. Love the chill in the morning and the afternoon warmth.
Take your temperature daily and monitor your breathing and coughing.

Let me introduce you to the liberating experience of shaving your head.
Youtube is a wealth of ideas and information. Reddit also has many subreddits... you might try r/spacebuckets
Now is the perfect time to do roadwork.  Plus it keeps money flowing to some people.  The financial hit will be catastrophic so some small road jobs are just drops in the bucket.  There will eventually have to be a massive federal bailout of state budgets as well.
The city should be putting a hard stop on all projects rnw. Especially ones with such a checkered past as this. Im not against the project, I think the city should be moving into very limited financial expenditures mode rnw. There will definitely be significant if not massive changes in their income and they should be preparing.
You could get a membership in SC they are opening their gyms next week.
Not unless you’re living with a professional.
If you're a guy, there are many videos on youtube on how to give yourself a buzz cut.  If you have longer hair, (male or female), just put your hair in a ponytail behind your head and snip the hair behind the elastic off.  It's not "perfect", but it at least is even and cuts off dead ends.
Not sure if serious.
Indeed! Happy Cake Day, North Buncombe neighbor.
Any tips for gardening? We took some time to build a little raised bed and planted a few veggies last week, first time we've tried it at all. So far not looking good, with the cold nights everything is dying fast. Maybe we just started with the wrong things (we got a handful of random seed packets from an event and just tried them all).   Would love any suggestions!
Well nows a great time to learn that one.
I was just trying to have a conversation but thanks.
Here's what the financial sound folks are doing instead of hoping on a fed bailout  https://www.wwaytv3.com/2020/04/22/covid-19-impact-on-ncdot-revenues-causes-delays-of-most-road-projects/
Damn. That's what I thought.
You never know man. People are getting creative with their businesses. Maybe there's a drive by barber running around town.
Thanks!
Oooh yeah. Ok. It depends on what you're growing. We're still pretty cool at night so this is a good time to sow beets or radishes, or even kale or lettuce or chard, but the soil is a bit cold for them to germinate. If you hang out on the gardening subreddits / discords / forums right now, you'll see lots of people starting their seeds indoors on heat mats, which is a good way to get things to germinate quickly.  You could plant warm season plants outside (tomatoes, zucchini, watermelon, etc.), but I wouldn't expect them to do much for awhile either, they want even warmer soil temperatures. Usually the seed packets will try to tell when you when to start them as seeds indoors, and/or when to direct sow outside.   This is a good time to start your tomato and pepper seeds indoors. You can sow those in the ground too, but again, you'll have to wait longer. This is also why some people just buy veggie starts at local nurseries, so they get an early jump on the growing season. Many people do a mix of both. So while I just direct seed sunflowers, I'll buy tomato starts from local nurseries, because it's cheap, easy, a huge time saver, and we're spoiled here because there's actually lots of places growing all kinds of unique varieties.  In the meantime, to protect what you have, you can try to protect in the evenings with an old sheet. You'll want to suspend the sheet over the plants, but not actually touch any of the plants. You can make or buy mini hoop houses that will help keep them warm, and help warm the soil temperatures too. I like to use thin flexible fiberglass rods + row cover. You'll want to remove the sheet or row cover on warm days though, it's just to help them through the cold really. Hope that helps!
I start my seeds in little dixie cups and grow them in the window until they are hardy enough to plant outside. Lettuce-like stuff can be planted now but wait until Mother's Day to get your peppers and tomatoes in the ground.
Get on the enewsletter lists for NC extension office and Buncombe County master gardeners.

COVID-19 Testing Now Available at Mercy Urgent Care

COVID-19 testing is now available at Mercy Urgent Care.  The short version is that you schedule a telemedicine visit and are referred for testing from your car.  At this time, testing is not recommended for those with no symptoms.  See their website for details.    https://mercyurgentcare.org/news/information-regarding-covid-19/
This is good news. Hopefully they have PPE and testing capacity to maintain testing.
Range urgent care too
Range worked with my insurance.
Better late than never.
We are competing with the other 49 states for PPE, still.  Maybe a National Government like, say....South Korea could help us.
Too bad range doesn’t work with insurance companies.
If only...
Most insurance barely does anything anyway until a huge deductible is met.
This is actually not true.  Range takes all insurance at this time. AND they are the best!  Locally owned, not a national franchise and they are doing drive though covid testing as we speak :)
urgent cares are done by copay not deductible usually.
Obamacare covers urgent care at a pretty low copay (seperate from deductible), as well as medicare and medicaid.
Good to hear. It’s been a minute since i went. FWIW, mercy urgent care is also local (Sisters of Mercy convent that once upon a time also ran St. Joseph's).
Yeah my visits are only like $40 bucks with my insurance and they are all very kind and know me by name. They’ve taken great care of me since they opened and they’re the only urgent care I would go to.
Ah ok. Thanks

New COVID-19 model: Projected peak in greater Charlotte now expected much later

This is what we want to see. A flatter curve takes longer to peak.
Not to fear monger, but there should be *two* peaks. Viral infections tend to die down in the summer and flare up in the winter.   Basically, outbreaks tend to represent an "M" shape. Flattening the curve essentially limits the *height* of the first peak, but as we ride the crest down, keep in mind we will expect another rise by October.   We might see restrictions relax in July, but anticipate a no-contact Halloween and to have your Thanksgiving and Christmas plans canceled.
Hey look. It is the great astroturfer in chief again. Hmmm. Look what the subject is. That's odd.
Is it me or are projection dates just getting pushed further and further to the right so people have something to write/worry about?
projections are just data. they cannot have an agenda. people can certainly abuse or twist data to fit their own agenda, but projections themselves are objective
The more we shelter in place the flatter the curve which in turn delays the peak. So if we’re doing it right, that’s how its supposed to work.  Flattening the curve saves lives by reducing the rate of hospitalizations at any given time, which prevents healthcare resources from becoming overwhelmed.
Surely it wouldn’t have an agenda behind it would it? It’s not like the GOP convention is set to take place in Charlotte in August.   Any fever swamp dream of the people behind these projections (bullshit) theories would have an agenda is complete lunacy. These are also the same “experts” who say climate change is the greatest threat to public health, and everybody will be dead because of climate change in 12 years  Just stay at home, doesn’t ask questions until the unelected bureaucratic public health officials give you permission to crawl out of your hole.  Enjoy your newfound medical tyranny

Graham County reopens roads that were closed because of COVID-19
https://wlos.com/news/local/roadblocks-for-covid-19-battle-removed-in-graham-county
As with every single WLOS story EVER, this story raises as many questions as it answers.  Curfew?  What are the hours for that and certainly there must be exceptions? What might the penalty be for violating a curfew?   Some were supportive, some very angry.  Did the officials or anyone else have a guess on rough percentage of calls for or against the action?  What prompted the action at this moment in time?
Good sign towards staying on track for end of month roll out.   Traffic has markedly increased in WNC have you noticed?
WLOS, where news goes to die
uh, no and no
Good
Nobody needs to hear from you, Trumpcuck
I can’t speak for the other posters but I’ve never been a trump supporter.   However I don’t think your foul responses speak for others that are non- trump or trump supporters either.   The polite and busy traffic on the street, the construction sites and work trucks, the pleasant people in the grocery stores and gas stations and Target too, restaurants and stores with curbside delivery, neighbors biking and walking with their kids, friends and pets are all showing positive signs despite your rancid negativity.
You seem like a really lame person... Did you latch onto your ideologies like some kid who joins a gang because you felt apart of something bigger than yourself?   Using tired and played out buzzword insults like your an extremely witty and highly intelligent comedian? You seem to have delusions of grandeur that people on the internet are waiting for you to give your immensely valuable opinion? You seem to care about accolades from random people on the internet as some how it is indicative that people really value you or your opinion?   How will I continue living my life now that you’ve informed me that nobody needs to hear from me? What will I do?
Shut it, apologist for a criminal, syphilitic, egomaniacal, lying, monsterous, half-witted, fat fucking bully with tiny hands.  There, is that better you useless piece of shit?

Post COVID-19: Which Asheville would you push for to come back?
[deleted][View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/g65kme)
It's a false question.    First - there's no going backwards to pre-tourism AVL.  That ship has sailed, and those folks will be back in droves once the gates open.  Second - Asheville in the 1990s wasn't all corporate restaurants.  There was Beanstreets, Laughing Seed, Salsa's, Barley's, the smoothie joint on Lexington, Rio Burrito, and a handful of others downtown.  Outside of downtown, there was Boston Pizza, APBC, Mother India, and lots of other independent Mexican and Chinese restaurants.  It's possible to have a balance of tourism and industry.  Asheville has just chased the dragon too far and for too long.  When nearly every service industry job loses between 1/12 and 1/6 of their clients/customers/revenue, it is going to take awhile to rebuild that.
It seems asheville put all of its eggs in one basket. Now that tourism is dead we can see how bad that decision was.
I'm old enough to remember when Asheville was a cool "art & craft" town.  Also we had $2 giant PBRs at Vincent's Ear.  The small squatter and punk scene was fun.  We had giant parties in the warehouses down at the river district.   We would eat at Dennys or Waffle House.   I did not require organic food at 2am.  We never asked for or wanted a  Cúrate.  Like wow I am hammered where is the  overpriced Spanish cuisine... not  Then somehow Asheville transformed into a craft beer, drunker prep paradise, free needles for junkies, Heroine oasis.   We are being invaded by boring tourist in khaki shorts.  Today downtown is lame and feels like a tourist trap with overpriced food.  Where is my damn Dennys or Bean Streets, or something cheap.
Quiter Asheville from the past.  Less about tourism. More about a cpl billion less people on earth. Less cars, less congestion. The early 2000s were great.  Incredible restaurants, local bars, enough breweries, parking, no smart phones, no waze, no yelp.
I'd prefer the Squashpile and Sonny's Bistro Asheville.
Anyone longing for the past is wearing rose tinted glasses. “B-but the congestion and traffic.” As if it’s impossible to have more people without more cars on the road.
 You make a valid point.   I miss Rio Burrito they had some great food on the cheap.  You could grab your food quickly and eat it on the go.
I imagine all those Air B&B investments are crashing like a house of cards.
This was truly the best time in Asheville. It’s strange how vividly it came back to me when the lockdown first started. How quiet everything was, how I could actually hear birds every morning instead of fucking cars, cars, everywhere. Now downtown feels like a loud, dirty circus where every visitor looks like they just came from a myrtle beach frat party.
truth.  I miss the little Lexington Art Festival and cheap coffee houses.
I miss when you had to know all the shortcuts.  Now anyone with a phone can find all the neighborhood cut thrus.  Navigation apps have ruined a lot of quiet streets in town.
You offering car rides?
We agree here.  The owner was almost always behind the counter, food was fresh and reasonable.  When his wife passed and he closed, I felt a loss for our town.
I'm not saying Asheville is or isn't full of corporate restaurants. I'm saying you are outlining a dichotomy that isn't there.  We don't have lots of tourists because we don't have corporate restaurants.  And we wouldn't lose all of our tourists by having more Sizzlers.    If you are asking if Asheville should pump the brakes on tourism marketing, I doubt anyone here would disagree with you.
Yup.
Those coffee houses are still cheap.
A few months ago I went to a comedy show where Cell phones were **not** allowed.   I loved it!  I spent more time looking at the phoneless crowd vs the show.  Oh how I dislike the "insta-face" phone culture.
I’m saying Ashevilles zoning and land use policy, much like many other American cities, is incredibly dysfunctional and onerous. If we focused on proper density, constructing welcoming pedestrian spaces, and prioritized active transit over cars Asheville residents would lead healthier lives without sitting in traffic for hours.
You underestimate my cheapness.
Izzy’s is, not sure I agree about the rest of em.
It has ruined modern society. I wish we all would just look up.  As I hammer away on my damn phone.
How do we convince people to further invest in public transportation?  The current system is underwater with only a few buses.   Do we raise bus fare, more taxes or something?
Alley Cat, Odds, and Underground are pretty cheap
That’s only because of the coronavirus pandemic. Earlier this year they added/ updated routes, introduced crosstown service, upgraded their fleet, etc. We’ve a long way to go of course.
No the public transportation system in Asheville has never paid for itself. It's well into the negative every year.  It's mismanaged like everything else the city touches.
That’s like complaining about the profitability of the Postal Service. As I said before we’ve a long way to go towards incentivizing wider adoption. It’s a multifaceted issue.
I do complain about profitability of the Postal Service.  It's mismanaged. Tax payers should be aware of how their money is spent.
It's mismanagement is by Congress. They are requiring the USPS to fund retirement for 75 years in the future. It's like UPS and FedEx don't like competition.  Personally, I think it's magic that I can drop an envelope and half a buck and within a week it's where I want it 2000 miles away.
The post office gets no tax money
*"It's mismanagement is by Congress"*   I agree It's government run.  *"It's like UPS and FedEx don't like competition."*   They would love to compete with First Class mail. Though it's illegal to do so.  UPS invented mail with tracking not ol' mismanaged USPS.  Several companies have offered faster first class but the supreme court shut it down.  *" Personally, I think it's magic that I can drop an envelope and half a  buck and within a week it's where I want it 2000 miles away. "*    I wish it did cost .50c but the *true* cost is much higher.  Stamps do not cover the true cost of First Class mail.    Overall USPS has a bad track record with mail vs UPS and FedEx.   Many business owners who rely on safe shipments would agree.  &#x200B;  anywho,,, we are waaay off topic.  I like old asheville!
Sure USPS loves to tell you that.  You might want to deep deeper.     How does a company like USPS have billion dollar loses year after year for over a decade and stay in business?  Answer.  Government aid.    Where does government get their money?  Answer: Tax payers.  USPS would have gone bankrupt long ago if it were a private entity.  FedEx & UPS certainly wouldn't exist if they were posting annual losses year after year.
2000 miles is 3218.69 km

After months of workers warning about unsafe conditions and union-busting, No Evil Foods workers face a possible COVID-19 outbreak

"After nearly a week of no posts regarding No Evil Foods..."
It’s really hard to take anything written by David Forbes seriously.
As someone who works at No Evil foods in the production floor, I can tell you this company is not as oppressive as it has been made out to be on this subreddit or online. They certainly make mistakes and mismanaged the company response to COVID-19 at the beginning of things, but it is truly just a small business figuring things out as they go. Though I don’t want to speak for my coworkers without their permission, I would just warn people who do not work for the company to take all of these articles and shock-pieces with a grain of salt. And to maybe direct your energy towards truly oppressive and greedy companies like Amazon.   (Throwaway account to protect identity just in case. I am happy to show proof of employment if I can find a way without revealing my identity lol)
Ya don’t say!
I was thinking the same thing - did yummyyummypancakes rebrand as smashed_hulk?
While this is no doubt a shitty company, take anything David Forbes says with a huge grain of salt. He’s known to embellish quite a bit.
Because you hate all trans people and scream that noone is allowed to dictate your speech when they point out you're an asshole for purposefully misgendering them?
Y’all hiring?
I trust her because David Forbes and The Blade is probably the most independent free press with a critical eye towards government than any other publication in the city, every other ones is white wash left or right wing garbage
I dont hate trans people. Where did you get that impression? And it’s not so much that you’re not allowed to dictate my speech it’s more like you’re unable to and that makes you angry.
Are you under the impression that people can see a name on a shit article and know if they are trans?  I think the article is shit. Idc if the person who wrote it is male, female, duck, etc.  What a dumb fucking thing to say.
It's usually Trump supporters, ardent capitalists, or transphobes defending this company. It's a repeating pattern that can't be mere coincidence.
David Forbes is way far left. He is what you describe and his articles clearly show that he’s an activist posing as a journalist. Wait, is that you David?
Your comment history, which I've had the great misfortune of watching unfold in real time across so many Asheville threads.    https://www.reddit.com/r/asheville/comments/g2nk43/asheville_in_coronavirus_crisis_looks_to_freeze/fnn38nb?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x "Anyway, David Forbes will have to get his prostate checked when he’s 50. So I refer to him as him, because he’s a male. Like I said, you, this dude and Dave can refer to him however you want. I care as much about that as you should care how I refer to him".  "No I don’t take issue with thinking this or that is racist. That’s an opinion and he’s free to have them. Just like it’s my opinion that he’s a hack activist posing as a journalist. What isn’t an opinion is that he has a Y chromosome."  "Ignorance is strength! Freedom is slavery! Men are women! Conservatives are fascist!"  Sounds to me like you hate the idea of trans people existing, and there's plenty more hatred like that throughout your post history. You're a fascist, and yes, it does make me angry that you're given any kind of platform at all.
This person knows David Forbes uses she/they pronouns.  They make a point of showing up to feign ignorance and spout their hate every time an article from David gets posted.
The pattern is: the same group of Rightwing creatures descend en masse anytime an article has a political dimension, or is written by someone further left than Breitbart Bleach Bros.    They all argue that words have no meaning when we're talking about respecting someone's gender choice, but that words have strict meanings when you are calling their ideology fascism.     They dismiss anyone to their left as insane, and insinuate they should be disallowed from voting or shot.  They then turn around and wag their fingers at us and say "you really should be trying to find more common ground with us." or "you're the real fascist".
No one is defending the company. Just saying that David Forbes is a hack and a male.
Yeah, you know those trump supporters and their plant based diets... Get real...
Wow you’re really invested in this huh? Point out the hatred part. I don’t see it. Do you know what the word means? I don’t care if they exist I just won’t indulge their or your delusions.   You think I’m a fascist because I won’t call a man in a dress “her”. And you also think that because I don’t agree with you that I shouldn’t be allowed to speak. All I can say about that is that I do hope that you can resolve your mental health issues.
Well if their other articles are anything like this one i dont blame them for not liking the authors opinions.  I cant speak for whatever your talking about on past things but seeing an article written by a "Dave Forbes" nobody would assume he wanted to be called a she.
You act like I’m talking like a normal person just to hurt his feelings. I could give a fuck about his feelings. Is he that weak that my refusing to call him a her bothers him that much? Are you that weak, Fjolnir (lol)? Why does what I say on the matter anger you so much that you think I should be silenced? Are your arguments on the issue also so weak that you’d rather the other side just be quiet?
Now you’re just making shit up.
That's some pretty vile transphobia. You'd think the owners of nef would be on here denouncing it.
 First thing I notice here is that **you don't deny being a fascist**.  You take issue with others calling you one, and with the strawman that "you don't want me to speak because I disagree with you".  I'm fine with polite disagreement.  You, however, are hellbent on hurting people whose gender does not match the sex they were assigned at birth.  You purposefully conflate sex and gender.  You deny the existince of transgendered people with your purposefully hateful choice of words.    You should be denied a platform because your words have no place in a liberal democracy.
You are attacking all trans people with your language, and you know it.    It's not weakness to point it out.
What the hell are you talking about? So now recognizing reality is transphobia? What’s up with you people just making up definitions for words? You know there’s a dictionary function on your phone right?  What’s nef and why would they be denouncing my using the proper words to define things?
Holy fuck this has got to be some of the dumbest shit ive read in a good while. Good job.  Calling a male a male doesnt make you a fascist. It doesnt mean you deny that trans people exist. Nobody denies they exist. Hard to dent something you can see, hear, and touch. It means you buy into biology more then this dumb social argument.   You cant spew off on someone for using "hateful words" while using hateful words. That makes no sense.   And its funny you say their words have no place in a liberal democracy. The liberal democracy you live in has a constitution. And in it is freedom of speech. Telling someone this is no place for their speech is a very disgusting thing that a fascists would say.   Your whole post is just pure irony. You think that because someone doesnt agree with you on a subject that their opinions dont matter. You truly sound like a fascist.
I don’t have to deny it. The transcript of our conversations already does. The only people who think I’m a fascist are people with your same condition or people who don’t know what the term means. You just said that you were angry that I had any platform. Then you said that was a straw man when I repeated it. Then you said again that I should be denied a platform. You need a dictionary my dude. You are less than fine with polite disagreement. You’ve been the nasty one every time we’ve spoken. You initiated this vitriol. I would love to have a polite discussion but you make that impossible by calling me a fascist hater. Very convenient. I disagree with you about an aspect of reality. To you that equates to being hellbent on hurting people (I’ve never hurt anyone) and being a fascist.   For real my man/woman/whatever, get help. You’re a wreck.
No it’s weakness to want those who you disagree with or those that offend your delicate sensibilities silenced.
No, you sound like a fascist.  Only a fascist is capable of reading the statement "fascist rhetoric has no place in our society" and call that statement fascist and hateful.
So in your head you are not a fascist for telling someone they shouldnt be allowed to speak.  In your head i am a fascist for saying that they do have a constitutional right to speak even if others dont agree with it?  Are you really that dumb?   You have no clue wtf you are talking about.
 1.  The constitution prevents the government from creating laws to restrict your speech, *while also providing for several exceptions to this general rule*, such as speech that upsets the peace or provokes violence, such as fighting words or extreme forms of obscenity .  *It does not give you an absolute right to say whatever you want, however you want to say it.*    2.  I have never said there should be a law preventing you from speaking.    3.  Making an argument that a certain type of speech should not be protected by the first amendment would not make me a fascist.
Their speech was not a call to action. It was biological fact.  So making an argument that what they said shouldnt be allowed is 100% something a fascist would do.  Your understanding of what isnt protected by the constitution is all wrong. I suggest you actually look into what the 1st amendment is before you keep mouthing off with your fascist bullshit.
You mentioned extreme obscenity. Would that include a man dressed as a woman twerking on kids at a library. Or a young boy dressed as a girl provocatively dancing on stage at a gay bar while men throw money at him?  Or would opposition to that be fascism?
He’s never looked at a dictionary, do you think he really gives a shit about the constitution?

But the shaded area is essentially the margin of error for the prediction, so we’ve got a wide range between not exceeding capacity and dramatically exceeding it - which would mean a spike in the mortality rate.What does this tell us? It tells us **we still have the time and ability** to minimize the loss of life in our state.To be blunt: We are not going to have widespread testing. There are lots of reasons for that - none of which have to do with our state and all of which have to do with the federal response - but it’s a reality. We’re still using tests and they're very important, but we're not going to test our way out of this like South Korea did. We just didn't get enough test kits fast enough.But - despite that major setback - it’s still possible to minimize the loss of life in our state by making sure we don’t max out the ICU beds. We just have to take social distancing very seriously for the next several weeks. In this model, OUR BEHAVIOR is the biggest variable. How seriously WE take this will ultimately determine the mortality rate.**Quick List*** We’ve only received 17% of the PPE that we requested from the federal government. That’s not good, and it’s why we’re sourcing from everywhere we can find and working with North Carolina manufacturers to switch production to PPE if at all possible.* The state’s unemployment insurance website and call center are still facing a nightmarish traffic jam as they get slammed with 50x the normal traffic, but we are adding servers and contracted with an additional call center to help field calls. If you’re having serious trouble, please fill out this customer contact form: [https://des.nc.gov/customer-contact-form](https://des.nc.gov/customer-contact-form).* Regarding the federal unemployment benefit that just passed, it will be administered by the state. We’re still waiting on implementation guidance from the federal Department of Labor, at which point benefits will be paid in about two weeks. Independent contractors and people who are self-employed will qualify for the federal benefit - they do not currently qualify for the state benefit. I know the state website isn’t set up to receive applications from people who are contractors or self-employed and that’s part of what we need to fix. If you fall into this category, just file the application as best you can.* Gov. Cooper’s new executive order means no one can shut off your electricity, gas, or water for at least the next 60 days.* The U.S. Corps of Engineers is helping us scout for places that could be used as hospital expansions.Stay strong. WE CAN DO THIS.More updates soon,Sen. Jeff Jackson
Keep the updates coming, /u/JeffJacksonNC  You've got young kids to wrangle, PPE to locate for our state, and a district to represent, and you make time to come here and post this to each NC city sub. It's noticed, and it's appreciated.
Not to be a downer, but that encouraging bend on the graph is for April 1st -- today. The reason its lower than the trend is becuase the day is only half over. We wont know where it ends up until tomorrow at the earliest.
Hi Senator, Curious if there has been any talk within the state of utilizing a company such as Thermo Fisher to manufacture tests based off of other rapid response tests known to exist. I know you said it is a federal issue but at what point can the state take this into its jurisdiction?   From everything I gather mathematical models show that identification and quarantine (at home) is the most effective tool we have in our arsenal. Social distancing measures can only do so much. Thank you very much for your time.
u/JeffJacksonNC  Thank you for your updates.  Other than the scouting for places with the U.S. Corps of Engineers, could you please speak to what specifically NC is doing to increase its number of beds and ventilators?   The [ProPublica projections](https://projects.propublica.org/graphics/covid-hospitals) for NC cities are extremely unsettling, and I think we would all greatly appreciate some information of what is being done behind the scenes to mitigate these scenarios.  Thank you again for the communication.
I'm curious to know how well the chart for beds reflects the sudden influx of people from the New York area last week. I have a feeling we're about to see a sudden spike from it, especially from locals infected by those who brought the disease with them not realizing they were infected.
Why is no one addressing the prison situation. My son is in prison for violating parole.  He is 30 years old and has a degree in physics.  He is also an addict.  I tried to get help for him, unsuccessfully. There is no help.  I thought maybe a short stint in prison would enlighten him.  I could have gotten him a lawyer but I felt like it would not teach him anything.  Well this has come back to bite me and him in the rear.  He does not deserve to die and that is exactly what hundreds if not thousands will do.  Why is no one addressing this? Put a leg bracelet on the short time non violent offenders.  He nor they do not deserve a death sentence.
>  it’s the best effort *that’s been made public*  [emphasis added]  Paranoia detail
Thanks SOOOOO MUCH for concise non-politicized information.  Information we so desperately need.
*"To be blunt: We are not going to have widespread testing \[...\] we're not going  to test our way out of this like South Korea did. We just didn't get enough test kits fast enough."*  That's all fair and pragmatic, and I can appreciate you're making the most of a botched Federal response.  But I am increasingly frustrated that you are then giving us case numbers and making predictions from them as if the data is an accurate reflection of reality.  If we're primarily only testing frontline workers, the case numbers are not giving us useful information, and this projection of an April peak is a rosy pipe-dream.  One that directly undermines the message you're trying to send:  *"OUR BEHAVIOR is the biggest variable. How seriously WE take this will ultimately determine the mortality rate. "*
Thank you!
Senator u/JeffJacksonNC , are there going to be any solutions for people who moved states right before this hit? I quit my job, with notice, in GA and started March 10, was laid off this Monday. NC DES already rejected me due to the base period, even though I included all of my GA employment.  I filed in GA Today but am nervous it’ll be rejected there too since my last job I quit to take one up here...  There are so many loopholes still on people who desperately need the money on actually getting it. And I can’t reach a human to get any sort of help.
Are people who aren’t unemployed getting the stimulus? I’ve been out of work nearly two weeks, waiting results of COVID testing 10 days now, and I’ve lost 1k in a trip to belgium bc I was forced to use all my leave. I have two kids and am their only source of income, and won’t be allowed to return till I’m 100%..
Who do we contact to complain about the federal response?
Thank you for the timely, honest, fact based information. The best antidote for fear and speculation! Keep it coming. You are a model for others, Jeff Jackson!
The "ICU Beds Available" shaded area appears misleading. Where are we going to get 2,000+ ICU beds on the fly? And why does it show available ICU beds going back to essentially zero on July?
Tonight, I raise a large glass of alcoholic kombucha DIPA that's been barrel aged for no less than 13 moons, in honor of our hard working state senator Jeff Jackson.    E: please consider running for senator Burr's seat in the future. You got my vote.
Denise offices, obgyn, sports offices certainly they can all spare something
I think you're probably right about that.
up you go
Unfortunately, that's probably not a huge concern for lots of folks in the US. Sadly, it's a hallmark of our society at this point if we're honest.
My parents tried tough love as well. Can't wait to see them in hell
If you’re right and the real numbers are much higher then it only underscores my point about the absolute necessity of social distancing.
Yes, every individual independent adult will get $1,200 as long as they make under 75k. They can make up to $99k until they get no money. Threshold increased for couples. So if one partner makes $90k and the other makes $40k, the couple gets a full $2,400.
At the voting booth in October.
GaryOldmanEveryone.gif
That's not what the shaded area means. That's the projected range of *demand* for the beds. The number of beds remains constant at roughly 800 (although on the chart it says 600, we've got about 800).
Your comment cracked me up.
Plus it's within the margin of error, too early to make a call!
Yeah, this was probably the biggest mistake that I have made.  Hindsight is 20/20.  He could have done so much, he is so smart.
Way to accept responsibility. It’s always someone else’s fault, isn’t it?
The numbers we know are bad. The numbers we dont know cant make it better.
Thanks for your time responding :)
thank you for clarifying that for me!
You can’t blame yourself for this situation. You have done what ANY good parent would have done. There’s only so much one can do.
Hey Cutty, thread got a little busy. I'm  just wondering if you comment was directed at me, or elsewhere?
From my understanding, you need to be update on your federal taxes and not owe anything to the government. You'll need to confirm those details though.
Yes, it was directed at you. If you have animosity towards your parents, then fine but there is no reason in making the person in this thread feel like shit for their decision when you have absolutely no idea what their situation is!

Coronavirus: NC asks FEMA to house people in hotels, dorms: Well if there's one thing we have in Asheville, it's hotel rooms.

Hoteliers in Asheville would probably rather burn down their buildings.  Then again people may never come back here again. Old school Asheville is back baby! Boarded up buildings, no restaurants, homeless people and hippies in the streets, punk rock houses in montford, and getting shot in West Asheville!!  Just like everyone says they want... And rent stays higher than bat pussy.
The more we come together on this, the faster we succeed in defeating it. Greed will always be sure to slow things down.
I have a feeling that people trapped in big cities are going to be making big migrations to smaller places after this is over. I think this will be welcomed by certain sectors like construction and homebuilders since outsiders might be able to afford what residents cannot? But with all the economic uncertainty everywhere, this is still unpredictable.  Any other predictions about priorities esp. related to tourism and hospitality? I read an interesting article today somewhere about how this would permanently damage short-term rental markets (i.e. Air BnB).
> And rent stays higher than bat pussy.  Upvoted just for that gem.  It's going to be interesting how this plays out. Maybe people will demand more no hospitality options for jobs....but then again, maybe not.
I was in Asheville a month ago before shit started to hit the fan. Everything was completely normal just how I remembered it and I had a great time seeing Bob Weir.   Little did I know that would be the last time I would experience the Asheville that I remembered when I lived there. This bums me out so damn much.   I really hope the city can recover, but deep down I know places that depend on hospitality are going to be hit the hardest in not only the short term but for years to come.
The growth here in the past 5 to 10 years has always been unsustainable. It was only a matter of time before something brought reality back into the picture. West Asheville has always been a shitty part of town, downtown has always been overpriced and not for the locals, and there have always been hippies and homeless, its just now you can see it because all the bullshit has dissolved. Asheville will always have the mountains and the beauty therein. There will always be creative types innovating new ways to survive here, this is not anything new. The downturn was always bound to happen. All the not so creative and gullible people will leave and we will be back where we started, with a city with a small town feel and plenty of abandoned infrastructure to make way for another boom. Not everyone can survive here, but thats ok, for those of us that call Asheville home and truly love the mountains it will be a refreshing break from the greed-centered growth that has taken over our city.  Edit: confusing wording and misspelling.
Asheville needs more great minds like this
I think we’ll see new home construction and other development slow down. But there will be lots of foreclosures which will get scooped up by investors. Those will end up as 2nd homes, STRs and long term rentals. With fewer owner occupied   homes and more rentals, rent prices will be dependent on how many service industry workers choose to leave for greener pastures and how many vacationers will return. Scarcity drives rent up. Property values themselves will plummet.   That’s my guess.

Coronavirus: Chefs worry about future, pay rent on empty restaurants

Hi /u/crankybear, some posted this already so I've removed it.
K.

Social distancing is now our primary weapon against the coronavirus. These next few weeks will determine whether we beat this thing and minimize the loss of life. We still have time to flatten the curve!

We need small business help. ASAP. I have a seasonal business. We will be shut down for the bill of the season. We don’t need payroll help. We need rent, utility and existing equipment lease help. The current “help” won’t last us until next spring. This PPP loan won’t help. There is no way for us pay it back in 2 years. This is crazy. I guess I should have started an airline instead
Bless him. I hope folks listen to this.

Hey guys. Don't worry. Jeff Jackson is going to be safe. Jeff is going to be OK through this. He is worried about his, errrrr, I mean, our, safety.   Thank God we have such a solid dude to make sure everything is going as planned.   Whoever, owing allegiance to the United States, levies war against them or adheres to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort within the United States or elsewhere, is guilty of treason and shall suffer death, or shall be imprisoned not less than five years and fined under this title but not less than $10,000; and shall be incapable of holding any office under the United States.
Have you applied for the disaster loan yet?  The 10k advance is all forgiven.  It's not a lot, but every little bit helps.
My understanding is the loan will be forgiven if you use it on payroll, rent and, mortgage or other expenses.  I believe the PPP is exactly what you are looking for.
Interesting to hear the state leadership passing the buck on their own action which are actively ruining our economy.  The impact of these policies is having a devastating effect far out of proportion to the virus’s...
I hadn't seen those numbers before. That's terrifying. That's saying that in a best case scenario, short of a miracle, we're gonna hit 100% capacity of our hospitals locally.
Yes. 5 days ago. Haven’t heard anything. Your supposed to get the $10k in 3 days
I think it’s federal
Yup, those numbers are pretty sobering.. which is why it is incredibly frustrating to not know what the state is doing on our behalf to increase capacity. Many citizens are doing our part by staying home, social distancing, etc., but what is our government doing??
I think it's 3 days once it's been approved, who knows how long that takes.  But I hear you - I own two businesses, one of which generates most of it's revenue in the spring.  'Bailout Airlines' has a nice ring to it...
They are over their skis in promising all these ridiculous timelines.  Most folks who applied for unemployment three weeks ago haven't seen anything yet, but they expect to turn around $10k in three days?
Move to South Korea if you love it so much. Fucking seriously. Pretty sure no one will miss you here.  My name is PrizedTurkey and I take statistics that were pulled out of someone's ass to use for the basis of my faulty argument! Look at me everyone! I can search the Internet and find information about things and stuff! It's too bad I don't question the legitimacy of the numbers that are being provided to me. If I did that, I would look like a fully actualized fucking human being.
Just to provide some scale, in 2018, a year with no Covid 19, roughly 97,000 people died in NC, and 2.8m in the US.   Yes Mr. Trump and his ilk have failed on this, no questions.   They are continuing to do so by allowing these statewide lockdowns to ravage the US economy.
The local orders to shut down businesses occurred frost, and the state wide order to effectively bankrupt many small businesses was next.  I am unaware of any federal orders that have had similar impacts...
The lack of leadership by federal government has left states, counties, and towns rudderless.  They've had to make their own decisions about health concerns that experts barely understand, and those decisions or nondecisions have led to the death of thousands   So yes, the federal decision to make no decision has left the ball in the court of inept local government officials who aren't as informed as the administration ought to be.  Sorry, this fault lies at the White House, no matter how you cut it.
Oh. My comment was about small business loans
Nah bitch. Stop lying. You're mad because I ate your crayons and there ain't a goddamn thing you can do about it. Mouth juggle my itchy sack ball washer.  Hang loose dude if the noose don't fit.
You realize that the DJI has ~5% growth between the first case unofficial reported case and the peak of the market on Feb 12..  The markets going down the drain is a direct reflection of the probability that our government would continue the poor choices of other countries.
If I were Trump I would definitely leave this dumpster fire as a state's rights issue. I can't wait to see Nancy Pelosi burned at the stake as all bad witches should be.
Good call! Let the citizens die to make political points with rivals!  Totally worth it.
You, I hope realize the difference between a 1 day change, and growth over a bit more than a quarter?
Those measures are needed, because we have chosen to absolutely destroy our way of life, basic freedoms, and our economy over the fears of this virus........  As O said earlier, there’s no question that we didn’t have the correct approach with this.  Of course, apparently neither did any other part of the world.....  This virus isn’t going to go away, no matter how long we cower in our homes.
Ah, yeah, sorry.  I forgot you’re one of those dumb fucks who will blame every ilk on Mr. Trump.... it was my mistake for taking you seriously.    And aren’t you the same person who said you hoped my family died in this, and then chose to later delete the comment?
Ah, yes I disagree with you, so I MUST be an incel....     You are really a load of laughs.
Yeah, you nailed it there bud.  You’re a joke and a half.
1/10 for execution and effort...

80% of people with coronavirus (COVID-19) have mild symptoms.

Remember 'mild symptoms' are anything that doesn't require ventilator usage.
80% of KNOWN cases. It's probably far, far greater than that when you factor in ALL cases.  No one knows what that number is right now.
Framing is really important: "80% of cases have mild symptoms" is the same thing as  "20% of cases have moderate to severe symptoms, including hospitalization and death".    Both of those statements are equally true, and both of them point the message in a specific direction. The reality of how dangerous this disease is probably lies somewhere in the murky middle.
I'm one of the people this will probably kill if I get it, so while 80% of you may have mild symptoms and be fine, a lot of us will not.  Please stay home.
Just upvoted this to get it from 0 to 1 upvotes... Who would downvote this, and why?
Yes I think you're right that there's probably much more people than that who've gotten it and not been reported, and that means the virus is actually much less lethal than has been reported, which should be a great relief.  I was listening to NPR's Up First podcast today and they said the newest and best computer models are revising the estimated number of US deaths down to 45k-120k at the most, which is about half of what the previous models estimated.
Deniers see this as "see, there's very little danger! Open the stores back up and get to work!"  Other see this and say "numbers are wildly underreported, we are all carrying the disease and endangering others"  And, because of the vacuum of leadership on the national level, none of us will ever know the truth.
Data isn’t as effective as hysteria inducing sound bytes. Because reading and math and not exciting as media froth.
Ment ventilator. Brain fart from previous conversation this morning. Will edit for clarity.
There are many problems with any predictions and it comes from the fact there is just no good data associated with this thing.  For example, in the simulation mentioned, does it distinguish between dying due to Covid-19 or dying with Covid-19.  It's not splitting hairs and an important distinction.  Most countries, states, municipalities are counting anyone dying with the disease as dying from the disease.  It does not matter if the person was already dying from another illness.    There is also a HUGE problem with knowing the number of cases.  Right now we simply have no way of knowing and could be underestimating it by a few times to a few hundred times.    Below is a link to an interview with a Standford research doctor that speaks to the lack of data.  He currently thinks the mortality rate is greatly over-estimated (he thinks it may be as low at 0.05% where the flu is 0.1%) but admits that he doesn't know because of a lack of data.  But he also says that anyone else making a claim, such as Dr. Fauci who claims it to be 1% also does not know for the same reason.  It's a very rational, no agenda interview that is worth a watch.  Lastly, what bothers me a great deal is when a person like the Surgeon General steps the podium and makes extremist statements that this week is going to be like 911 and Pearl Harbor.  There is zero need for that and it accomplishes nothing besides creating undue panic.   It also makes me think he is completely out of touch with what's going on.

>Asymptomatic infection has been reported, but the majority of the relatively rare cases who are asymptomatic on the date of identification/report went on to develop disease. The proportion of truly asymptomatic infections is unclear but appears to be relatively rare and does not appear to be a major driver of transmission.  Yes.  That is from the World Health Organization's website.  It's funny that everyone still runs with the idea that asymptomatic people are as contagious as someone in the throes of the disease, but it's all about link clicks while fact-checking gets a backseat at best.

Coronavirus: Henderson COVID-19 cases double, assisted living outbreak

23 cases in the Cherry Springs Village,  assisted living community in Hendersonville.
I expect an extremely high death rate and contagion rate in Henderson county.  We are filled with retirees who have no immune system and major health issues.  Our retirement homes are way understaffed and underpaid.  We don’t have nearly enough room at our two hospitals either.  However, I’m curious how Asheville will fare with a for-profit hospital that is severely understaffed.  I could see a for-profit hospital “stabilizing” and releasing corona patients that don’t have insurance.

APD looks to arrest Airbnb owner Shawn Johnson, who they say broke coronavirus order

If The Hot Spot was a person.
Shit like this pisses me off not because of wuhan but because it makes it even harder for people to trust people who have a troubled past.  My husband did 2 years in prison about ten years ago and it took a lot of hard work in order to prosper after that. And i know a fair amount of people with criminal records who dont want anything to do with that life any more and just want to love a normal life.  Then assholes like this get praise for turning their life around just to continue to fuck up making it harder to trust anyone.  Fuck him.
what is he "celebrated" for?
He fucked a lot of people over many times. He actually did a couple nice things for me when I moved houses in town. Then I invited him to my housewarming party & he was an ass to several of my guests. He just wanted me to spread good pr about him. Anyway, sleazy at best.
I’ve seen so much bad shit about Shawn and it’s crazy to comprehend because h had my husband and I completely fooled. He was our realtor when we bought our first ever house and although he pulled some really whacky shit, none of it wasn’t in our best interest as home buyers. I know he went on to fuck a ton of people over but we had a strangely okay experience and seeing these stories is always so bizarre. Now I know what he was getting at when he seemingly jokingly asked if we’re “interested in investment properties.”
So....... How about just get rid of air bnb period. Fucking blight.
My friend is the one who nailed him! He called the sheriffs office and the sheriffs office had no idea that the governor shut down short term rentals down during pandemic... I’m not sure whos more of a douche; shawn johnson or the sheriffs department!?
ACT posted the article on Facebook and homeboy is the first one to comment. You couldn't make this up lol
I'm surprised AirBnB would even take reservations during this crisis in a town where it is currently illegal.  I do know they are making exceptions for nurses and other health care providers, however.
286lbs.  Oof.
Damn Shawn.
Greasy, to say the least.
So now we know who is behind that twitter account
Only thing better than that is getting banned from WAX
Haha. I thought that was him. About five years back or so he was a WAX Superstar
WAX has had "celebrities", this result of colon blow is one of them.

Holy shit, you made a funny joke that wasn't racist or idiotic. Well done. Here's your fucking upvote
AirBnB has no morals or ethics.
There are dozens of Asheville Airbnb accommodations taking reservations currently. Why go after this guy in particular?
Has the city or county asked airbnb to allow for reservations?
Sure he's holed up now. But I'm sure the cops know at 286, he's going to show for groceries soon.
My thought exactly. He’s got it hard enough right now hahaha
You made me chuckle.  That is not easy.
He might have covid!
I'm guessing the neighbors turned him in.  But you can still take a reservation for an essential worker so I guess there is nothing wrong with taking reservations in specific instances.
I doubt Asheville would communicate with Airbnb.

Resources for businesses affected by coronavirus
This is an unprecedented time for everyone in North Carolina and with the statewide stay-at-home order, businesses everywhere are struggling to keep their doors open. Here is a list of resources for businesses in North Carolina that may be able to help some business owners. It's a list of loans available, how to file an unemployment insurance claim, new family and medical leave rules, and even how to begin producing PPE to support healthcare workers. With all the uncertainty floating around about the economy and our state, hopefully this list can answer some questions for people and start connecting them to resources that can help.Business Resources: https://edpnc.com/covid-19-resources/

Thank you, pastor Copeland, for sending the wind of god to blow the Coronavirus out of Asheville. /s

Coronavirus Crisis: Snapshot of Western North Carolina: Rolling Stone

So people were tubing, in March, in the water (not a canoe or contained tube)?
Neat shots. Thanks for sharing.
a rolling stone gathers no kudzu.
Can confirm that...walked to the park on a hot day and saw SO MANY people on the water
It got up to 90 two weekends ago. Honestly, I regret not tubing.
Maybe? It was upper 80s, remember?

How to track your coronavirus stimulus check from the IRS | Cnet.com

Honestly, i’d much rather have the money than the promise of a tool.  Edit: typos
TurboTax launched a tool in collaboration with the IRS to help people register to receive their stimulus check who normally are not required to file taxes for 2019 (income below required level). Not for Social security or railroad income recipients, no action required for those folks. Helps you file a simple 2019 return and is free:   [TurboTax stimulus calculator and link to registration ](https://turbotax.intuit.com/stimulus-check/)

Coronavirus pandemic is not a time for congregating in WNC's outdoors


Coronavirus pandemic is not a time for congregating in WNC's outdoors

So the article is about how we shouldn’t be hiking...but she went hiking?? Ok...
With such a terrible title I can't bring myself to read the article. I mean, is it a good time to be congregating in Eastern NC's outdoors? Or how about congregating in WNC's indoors?   Sounds like the article is implying we shouldn't be hiking, but that's nonsense. Staying inside, afraid, not getting enough sun or enough exercise, just bingeing Netflix and overeating, that's a recipe for sickness right there.
r/cringetopia
 TLDR: Author loves hiking but is almost deaf, cannot hear other hikers,  is unable to practice safe social distancing because other hikers not  observing the social distancing rules. Author cannot heat them, author  calls everyone who wants to go hiking "privileged" because her lack of  hearing is causing her to not be able to hike during this time.   Sometimes you can't make this shit up, Asheville.
Oh, go fuck yourself.  "Author" has been a long-standinv member of the outdoor community and written books about the outdoors. "Author" can't make other people obey social distancing guidelines, because people are jackasses.  "Author" recognizes people are flocking to outdoor places, but people at risk.
Dawn is amazing, and what she's been through is inspiring. Go back to wherever you came from.
But she can obey them herself. By not going hiking on those trails.   Pretty simple concept.
I dont know her. And have nothing against her personally.   But its just dumb to go hiking and complain about others being there.  Its a weird concept for people here....but you dont need to go to a public trail to go hiking. We live in the mountains for christ sake. People have been hiking in the mountains for hundreds of years. I can go out my backdoor and hike in the woods and not see a person for miles.
But yet, you know she's stupid. So, go bushwack through unknown 60,000 acres. What possibly could go wrong?
I don't think anyone thinks she is stupid. You on the other hand.
I didnt say she is stupid at all. Like i said i dont know her personally.  But if me and my kids can go on hikes in the woods why cant a woman who literally writes books on hiking?  Im not saying she has to grab a pickaxe and start climbing a rocky mountain. But i find it asinine if someone can write books on hiking but cant hike on anything but public trails.  Have you never been in the woods? We dont live in the amazon where you need to cut down trees to hike.   If its such a big issue...dont go hiking. Go for a run/walk/bike ride.

Rant about coronavirus online school situation
Ok so as you know schools have been closed due to COVID-19 for a while now but I have noticed that all of my teachers have yet to put any grades in for the online work we have done. I haven't gotten an answer from any of my teachers regarding this.I asked a friend who's parents are teachers what was going on. He said that the state hasn't "approved" them to put in grades. Also, they automatically passed all of the seniors if they had a passing grade before March 23.I'm just really frustrated because it seems like there is no point in doing the work if it's not going be graded. I'm still keeping up just Incase they suddenly decide to grade stuff.Is anyone here having the same problem?
Wake County elementary and middle school have not been grading any of the work until now either. The reason they gave is because they can't expect all students to suddenly have the remote school resources; it would be an unfair imbalance. So they have been posting some assignments, so that parents can voluntarily practice with kids. In the meantime, they have actively worked to make sure all the kids have access to remote learning tools, laptops and tablets loaned out as necessary. Starting Monday, the assignments will now graded, as the resources are in the hands of the kids.      This is probably the same reason as your HS.
Focus on the knowledge, not the grades - they never really mattered anyhow.  There's going to be a huge number of students going into college who are missing big concepts - you can get a step up on them by understanding your calc, comp sci or whatever.  Unless this is all about French...you can probably stop turning in that homework.
Sorry to hear that you haven't been getting transparency from your teachers-- that is frustrating, to say the least (though as someone who teaches and works closely with public schools, I know there is a LOT teachers are juggling right now). Here's a link to a press-release from NC DPI (Department of Public Education) that might give you some context for what has been approved state-wide. Though, coming from someone who blew off most of their senior year of HS, I'd highly recommend still engaging with class material as you're able to.
I work in Ed-Tech, helping teachers nation-wide navigate moving to remote education.   Please be patient with the teachers, who for the most part have been forced to completely revamp how they teach, what they teach, with very little guidance from the State/District.   My company does not work with Buncombe County of Asheville city, so can't speak to the situation specifically.  What I am starting to see is that the slow bureaucracies of State Education Departments across the country  are just now starting to dictate the "rules of the game" to teachers.   To use a sport analogy, teachers were basically told to play the game of remote education, without  rules or referees. Now rules are being written as they play, and referees are telling them that not only do they need to follow the rules, but that they *should have been following the rules* the whole time they have been playing, even if they did not know what the rules were. Some teachers figured this was how the game was going to work, and haven't been grading anything (knowing that the rules would change anyway) and others have been grading, and now are having to go back and change how they are grading, to meet the rules sent down from the state. To be honest, either way is frustrating to students and parents.
Pro tip: in the real world there is no such thing as a down vote
Allow me to use this example of why socialism is bad....   See you have been doing your work and your classmates most likely haven’t because they know it doesn’t matter they will get their grades anyway. Now here you are having done all your own work to get a better grade for yourself, but all your hard work will be for nothing if it doesn’t get graded... That’s socialism my friend
No, I'm in an adjacent county. Thanks for reaching out though!
This is what I was going to say.  You certainly are in a very strange situation, and unfortunately we were not well prepared to handle it.  Just make sure you are learning the concepts well and stay focused on yourself and your future.  You'll be ok!

I’m not your comrade, in 10 years after the public school indoctrination wears off and your in the real world oustside of academia that extols the virtues of communism from your professor who is living off charging you $10,000 a semester, then maybe you will wake up

Coronavirus: Buncombe reports 3rd death due to COVID-19

So Buncombe county's mortality rate is nearly 8%. Besides reporting fuck all, wtf is going on here?
Buncombe counties mortality rate isn't 8% it's less than 1% same as everywhere else.  More than half the people that get the Rona will recover without even knowing they had it, literally no symptoms.  The rest will have symptoms ranging between a slight cold all the way to full blown Rona with ~10% requiring some form of medical intervention.    Lack of testing is what causes the numbers to look like that. Not really much to be done about it, the tests don't exist in enough supply to get the real number of infected.
>38 confirmed cases - 3 deaths = roughly 8%  Way to push your fear mongering narrative.  I've made up nothing, I am capable of looking at fact.  No, we don't know the real number but we have educated guesses based on places that tested 100% of the population.  [Here's one](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/24/us/diamond-princess-cruise-ship-asymptomatic-tests/index.html) [And here's another](https://www.newsweek.com/coronavirus-mass-testing-experiment-italian-town-covid-19-outbreak-1493183?amp=1#aoh=15869169429620&referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com&amp_tf=From%20%251%24s) do I need to continue on to get you the rest of the numbers I used? Honestly doesn't matter at this point I'm convinced you are a bad actor who wants to spread fear and misinformation as wide as you can.
You're just making numbers up? Why? What the fuck is wrong with you?   Dude you have major issues I don't know why you want to fear monger but you need to stop. It's fucking wrong and you should be ashamed of yourself.

Asheville in coronavirus crisis looks to freeze pay, bus upgrades, renewable energy additions

David Forbes has a good blow-by-blow of the recent City Council meeting on her Twitter feed.  My favorite moment came as council was on break and David had some time to reflect:  https://twitter.com/DavidForbes/status/1250167069246730240?s=20  "Remember a few months ago when myself, @amiwhoa and @matilda_bliss  (and a lot of other locals) were shouting that aggressively pushing tourism was damaging our communities and making our city much less resilient?   Remember how the hoteliers and gentry lost their shit over that?  Anyway, just on my mind after sitting through an hour and a half of officials suddenly admitting basing everything on tourism has made Asheville really fragile while forgetting they've spent years actively attacking anyone who pointed out the obvious."
Is this the same David Forbes that’s calls pretty much everyone to his right a fascist?
Wholly unrelated, but where did you come up with your username? Sounds viking and therefore badass.
No, this is the David Forbes that uses she/they pronouns and calls *fascists* fascist.  Edit:  you'll note this person can give no examples of David calling anyone a fascist, and is just angry that their own rightwing politics get criticized in general.
Yeah OP hit us with some revisionist history about how the vikings were super progressive and all the lost sagas about transsexual berserkers.   Pretty sure the vikings would have thrown him/her/they and David Forbes in a bog.
I guess you, him and Webster will have to disagree on the definition of fascist.
>No, this is the David Forbes that uses she/they pronouns **and calls** ***fascists*** **fascist.**   >   >Edit:  you'll note this person **can give no examples of David calling anyone a fascist**, and is just angry that their own rightwing politics get criticized in general.  Anyone see the double speak here?  This is taken from a single post.
What's a transsexual berserker?
I figured you were mis-gendering her on purpose.  Please delete your AVL account, and your AVL life.  Edit:  oh look, all the local fascists whose accounts were created in the last 2 months!
A fevered dream in the mind of Asheville leftists.
No I had no idea he used those pronouns. He is more than welcome to and so are you. But you’re not welcome to dictate my speech or the definition of fascist.  Edit: yeah see what I mean? “I don’t like your opinion, you’re a fascist” That just proves my point.
Yes more censorship.  Down with diversity of ideas.
&#x200B;  Perhaps mass quarantine and boredom has encouraged people to join social media.  What difference does it make anyway?  Why must we have long standing accounts to have a voice?  Do you even know what a fascists is?   These "buzzwords" are idiotic
Why bother not calling someone what they desire to be called?
Wrongthink is not tolerated here.
It’s a way to lessen others’ opinions without actually engaging with those opinions.
You’re talking about a guy that calls people who aren’t fascists “fascists”.  I should be concerned with what he wants me to call him? Fuck that.
Yes comrade Ignorance is strength!  Doubleplus good.
This is true.  BTW: Back to the original topic.  I have met and hungout with  David Forbes.  Local west asheville party and bonfire many years back.   He is a complete sleaze creep.  He arrived in complete full leather outfit and hit on all the women. (unsuccessfully)
Who did they deem to be fascists? I’m not familiar with this person.
Ignorance is strength! Freedom is slavery! Men are women! Conservatives are fascist! Oceania has always been at war with Eastasia!  These people are fucking lunatics and sadly they’re allowed to vote.
I’m cringing yet intrigued.
He writes for the Asheville Blade. If you care to read some of his articles you’ll see what I’m talking about. Calling basicbitch Republicans “fascists”, that kind of thing.
[Here](https://ashevilleblade.com/?p=3757) he is calling WANA far right.
The left is very tolerant and open minded.  **Unless**.....  *You are a Boomer,  White Male, Nuclear Family,  believe in only 2 Genders,  Christian, believe in personal property rights, believe in free speech, believe in stronger borders, believe in Voter ID to prevent voter fraud.*  **If we are found guilty of the above we will be censored, downvoted and removed from social media platforms.  Threatening our lives is also permitted and promoted.  Want to give a speech? Expect a dumpster fire and broken windows**
Maybe this is why David switched over to "she"  ??
I’d say that contemporary members of the GOP have fascistic tendencies sure. I don’t know why you’d carry water for them regardless. Not really looking to hold up some conception of both sides-ism.
WANA members are NIMBYs which is arguably just as bad.
This is all very true. The people who think it’s ok for a man dressed as a woman to twerk for kids at a library are the same people who will wag their finger at you if you think illegals should be repatriated.
If you can’t beat em, join em.
I’m carrying water for words having meanings. Remember when Bush and his followers were calling everyone terrorists just because they were on the opposing side? It’s just irritating and causes the words to lose meaning. Anyway, David Forbes will have to get his prostate checked when he’s 50. So I refer to him as him, because he’s a male. Like I said, you, this dude and Dave can refer to him however you want. I care as much about that as you should care how I refer to him.
You’re saying that people who don’t want dirty needles on their playgrounds are as bad as fascists? Are you high?
You don't like Drag Queen Story Time being forced on your children? WrongThink!!  Would they support Conservative Story Time?  I wonder
hahahahahahah
I'm just stopping by to upvote everything you posted here.  You took the words out of my mouth. Cheers
From passing through David Forbes’ articles on the Blade I can’t find them referring to anyone as a fascist however they’ve called certain people or policies racist which I suppose you have an issue with? And my point is that it’s just a matter of courtesy using someone’s pronouns that they’d like you to use. It’s the same if I wanted you to use a nickname in lieu of my actual name.
I’m saying being anti-development and anti-homeless people are rather ridiculous principles to hold to.
Seriously these are the same people that think you’re literally Hitler if you send illegal immigrant kids back to their country but it’s totally cool to kill them in the womb because someone didn’t feel like using a condom.
I guess your short perusal didn’t come up with anything. It’s there if you care to look further. No I don’t take issue with thinking this or that is racist. That’s an opinion and he’s free to have them. Just like it’s my opinion that he’s a hack activist posing as a journalist. What isn’t an opinion is that he has a Y chromosome.   I get your point. My point is that if someone slanders others by calling them things that they aren’t, then that person can fuck right off if they want me to call them “she” when it’s a he. I have no obligation to be courteous to the non-courteous nor do I have an obligation indulge his delusions.
You’re said that’s just as bad as fascism which is insane. We’re anti-dirty needles on playgrounds. That doesn’t make us anti-development or anti-homeless and saying so is quite idiotic.
Do not get discouraged.   I have met many people under 20 that think like us. and have a basic understanding of personal freedom . There is hope in Gen Z
Seriously, there are adults who still make this ridiculous comparison?
Having needle exchange centers and overdose prevention drugs doesn’t cause needles on playgrounds. Your group simply wants the clean needle exchange gone which will escalate the problem with Asheville being an epicenter of the opioid crisis.
Oh I’ve met plenty. They just keep their heads down. For now.
Yeah omg it’s totes crazy. Killing unborn kids is progressive, sending illegal’s kids back to their home country is fascist. I can’t believe there’s still adults who can carry around that kind of conflicting logic.
Passing out needles doesn’t put more needles on the street. That’s some weird logic you have. We want the needle exchange gone because we don’t want our neighborhoods to be places where these people flock to and ruin. To say that we are anti-homeless is disingenuous. We want the people who are ruining our neighborhoods (Firestorm and Steady Collective) gone.
I assumed the response would be dumb. This exceeded my expectations
>these people  They're our neighbors ya cunt
My point being that in the midst of a drug epidemic you’d see needles there regardless. Needle exchange don’t exacerbate the proliferation of needles strung about; quite the opposite. Are you suggesting we let them die? Oh how terrible it is to see homeless people in your upwardly mobile bourgeois suburb.
What world are you living in where handing out needles doesn’t mean more needles? If there was an Olympic event for mental gymnastics you would win the gold. Do you know anything about the anarchists that are running the needle exchange? They aren’t being altruistic. They’re trying to lower property values to combat “gentrification”.
Your fault you have all your equity tied to your home. You’d likely oppose any new housing being built in West Asheville as well for similar reasons.
You make quite a few assumptions. Can I try it too? You’re likely a white progressive who grew up in an upper middle class home and has very little experience with hard times. You think it makes you sound righteous to look out for the downtrodden, so long as you don’t have to interact with them. You also think it makes you sound intellectual to use words like “bourgeois”. You fight the power without actually putting yourself in danger.
All of your assumptions fall flat in the face of reality. I grew up working poor the entirety of my life. On more than one occasion I was on the verge of homelessness and had periods where my home didn’t have running water or electricity in the summer. I’ve interacted and have known plenty of homeless people, under housed people, addicts, etc. My priority is that we ensure there’s enough housing and that those who have a chemical dependency to drugs can find assistance. I know it really sucks visibly seeing homeless people when you’re going to brunch but that’s life.
How did that make you feel when someone made false assumptions about you? Did you like it? No? Then why do you do it to other people? I thought we learned this stuff in preschool.
It’s patently obvious given that you’re likely a homeowner that you have all your equity tied to your home and that you feel more homeless people in proximity in your neighborhood would bring down the artificially inflated value of your home. I’m not saying you’re a bad person but there are perverse incentives when it comes to protecting your investment ie your home.
You keep doing it. And you’re wrong.
Ok you don’t own a home in West Asheville got it

Coronavirus: Asheville tourism recovery could be sluggish, painful

 I think the entire country is going to be sluggish and painful when it comes to recovery.
This, “The TDA derives nearly all its income from a 6% hotel occupancy tax, then disburses 75% of revenues for marketing and 25% for tourism development projects.” needs to change. Reduce marketing by 25% and put towards developing non tourism based business in our community. We need to diversify some in order to make a more resilient economy for our community. Once we get through this and recover it is not if but when will the next hit to tourism happen?
It says Mast General Store is pretty much a ghost town. Shouldn’t it be closed?  Just wondering.
No real surprise, but some interesting details.
Maybe they should just sell the whole town to inbev  /s
It’s not a question WHEN we should open, it’s a question of IF we should open back up. It’s sad to see people value money more than the safety of the general public...
I didn't even realize Mast General was open.  Essential or not, I'd feel awkward walking around downtown during these times.  It doesn't seem the appropriate thing to do.
Güd
Perhaps some newbies will see old school Asheville
I know some people want everything to recover to the way it was, but I'm OK with maybe slowing down just a little bit.  While most of this epidemic really sucks, I've enjoyed the break and spending time with my immediate family.  My kids are less on their phones than they used to be, we consume much less, and the environment seems to be recovering a little bit with cleaner air and less waste.    Don't get me wrong, I know people need to get back to work and the ambitious and industrious among us want to create and build up their material wealth and ensure their financial security.  I just hope we can adjust our new normal to get more of the good things we've enjoyed from this slowdown.
County, hell, world. We're a huge importer of Chinese manufactured goods. Can't import goods if no one can buy them. (Except the new Iphone). If the internet bubble taught us anything it's that a growth based economy is absolutely shit in a crisis. We ignored it through 9/11 and the housing market collapse. Let's not make this third times the charm when the next science warned eventuality comes to fruit.
You guys didn’t read past the page break, further down in the article it says all 11 mast General stores are closed for the time being.
But they sell kitchen supplies and bulk candy.  Definitely essential.
As the story there are still deliveries coming in and goods to be put away.
We will lose a lot of Asheville small businesses. Makes me sad. I worry that we will be innundated with Victoria's Secret and Hollister downtown to fill empty spaces.  We won't go back to 1980's Asheville. We will look like Any City, USA.
It's funny that I can still barely find a parking spot in certain parts.
It isn't. Owner is only employee not let go.
I agree, my relationship with my almost 11yo and 14yo has been amazing! What a blessing this has been for our family. I want the security of what our boisterous economy gave us but am not wanting to let what our family has built go away. I think the new economy will reflect that for quite some time. Truth is we had a class of bartenders here who cleared 50k a/yr them and those among them is going to paint a societal picture that will bring to light the inequalities in our midst @Asheville
I can see how they got themselves qualified as essential based on the candy and kitchen supplies. Really considering the type of equipment they carry it’s a bit of a stretch to me though. They don’t have basic pots, pans, dishes, silverware.  They do carry cast iron pans. Those are awesome, but the rest is pretty iffy to me. Candy is great, but is it essential?  Considering it’s tourist priced there and easily available at any grocery store I have a hard time deeming it essential. Just my thoughts though. The employees have been laid off so it’s not like keeping the doors open is even helping them.
Forgot about the kitchen supplies!  Thanks!
 >We won't go back to 1980's Asheville. We will look like Any City, USA.  We already do.
50k isn’t much for a bartender in a tourist town.  Some folks are clearing 6 figures.  A busy hotel bar during peak season is super lucrative.  If you are mad that restaurant folks made more than you, then spend the 15 years building business like Jackson has at the Biergarten and you will be well off too.
The shops at the airport
Geez way to sound like a tool. I was only saying that restaurant workers who had no intention of switching careers will suffer from this. Born and raised here ass hole with my own business of 10 years. All I was saying was some of those jobs might not come back and that will impact this area. Fucking snob
"Some folks are clearing six figures" you fucking idiot. More than happy to meet you up with you in person here jackass then you can try to tell me what i am upset about when i pull up in my 2020 f250 ready to whoop your ass
Get a bar job. Then buy a real truck.
LOL

Coronavirus: Without aid, Asheville restaurants face uncertain future

I own a bakery in Hendersonville. We are smaller, but I have been offered to not pay rent, but then I’ll have to make it up later, we had the money so rent got paid. Laid off our 4 employees so they could get their federal and state money. Been doing Saturday brunch pickup and delivery, this covered the bills for the month. Bills are less due to not using much power or gas. Even had one customer offer to cover rent if we had to close.   Hope everyone pulls through!
And meanwhile the city government sits back and does nothing.  Tens of millions in a tourist fund. Havent even tried to find a way to use it to save local businesses.  If a shit load of places close down who is going to want to some to asheville?   But they are still getting paid so they just tell us to stay at home and ask the feds for help.
its the same everywhere.  i work for a chain of restaurants in Oregon and we've been closed for over a month.
We need a rent freeze.  None of the government efforts address how much of a role overhead plays in small business these days.
Actually, it's more like many, perhaps most, are hosed. They simply don't have the resources to survive and the federal government programs, like the SBA Paycheck Protection Program, really doesn't work for restaurants. And, of course, the PPP's out of money anyway.
Get maybe they could dip into that massive tourism budget and pay some restaurants rent and staff?
I undetstand the ppp,sba isnt perfect but but tailoring it to fit every business while at the same time getting it out fast enough for it to make a difference are two things that I'm sure were at odds with eachother. Only thing we can do is petition the Governor to amend the terms after the fact and to stop holding up the money for there social justice nonsense. There's a time and place for that and this isn't it.
Alright commie, install ubi and watch all the nurses, truck drivers, grocery store attendants all quit there jobs as the healthcare system and food distribution networks collapse. No thanks!!
That's a county tax and ur beef is more with county
That would be government overreach taken to a whole new level, land owners still have mortgages, taxes, and building maintenance issues to pay for, that being said some rent is better than no rent so It would be worth negotiating a temporary reduction in rent to help share the pain considering it's not like they would be able to rent out there business space to anyone else givin the circumstances.
Yes, the BCTDA should step up and help restaurants survive. Fewer restaurants will mean fewer tourists. This would be the best way to spend tourism promotion hotel room taxes.
I think one of the issues is the paltry amount (350 billion) compared to what is being doled out to the giant corporations. The help to small businesses was incredibly limited.
I'd love to know what you are referring to by "there social justice nonsense."  Or were you just on a roll?
Landlords can get a mortgage deferral relatively easy - banks have been processing dozens of them every week in town.  A rent freeze would simply make that automatic - the only losers would be the banks and municipalities....which is why it won't happen.
Ppp, and sba are out of money. Democrats are holding up the aid cause they want it to be funneled to women and minorities instead of being first come first serve. The Corona  virus doesn't give a shit what race you are, everyone needs help.
Ah okay.  The rest of your reply was mostly sensible.  That part is straight trash.
That is not what happened as to what the Democrats wanted. They wanted to provide funding for hospitals and cities impacted by the pandemic, not give more free money to corporate chains. They were successful as some of those funds will be allocated to broader priorities.
Its cause their more Interested in pandering for votes instead of getting the money out so it can help people.  Say what you will but that's how I see it.
They added bailouts for all these major cities who have bascially bankrupted themselves before any of this covid mess to begin with
They added that as well but that's not what is holding it up, besides that it has nothing to do with what ppp, and sba was supposed to do. they could have easily passed this and introduced that as a separate bill. Not only that but adding in all that extra stuff is just going to drain the money out of it faster taking away from what it is supposed to be for which is helping small businesses not go under.

Coronavirus V: Last Week Tonight with John Oliver (HBO)

Hi! This is a great segment with great information, but since it's technically a national post, I've removed it. You're welcome to post it in the Free Talk thread or I'm open to you reposting it as a text post with some good Asheville-specific discussion questions. Thanks for understanding!

Coronavirus: Buncombe health officials address 'reopen' protests

Isn't it interesting that these astroturfed "protests" received a huge amount of media coverage and are being given credence by a wealth of attention by "experts", but when the Standing Rock protests were going on for months they received barely any mention at all. Why is that, do you think?
tl;dr: Asheville is not reopening anytime soon.

Early indications from antibody tests indicate that the death rate is lower than 1%. For example, 1/3 people in a Boston area study randomly selected on the street tested positive for antibodies and most had no idea they had had it. There's also a few out of California. If subsequent studies continue to show that to be the case, it could happen a lot sooner.
There's no confirmation that having antibodies gives one immunity. In addition, the antibodies that can be present in a test can fade and no longer be present in subsequent tests. If we allow antibody tests to lure us into premature relaxation of these rules, we will most definitely see a 2nd (and 3rd, etc...) resurgence.   We will be doing this in some form until a vaccine is widespread.
We found the InfoWars fan.
Because of course people don't get over a pathogen from antibodies. Now there's no scientific study that has been completed yet, but there isn't a 100 completed study on any of this as it's too new. Also, if antibodies don't work, then a vaccine genuinely is worthless since it works by creating antibodies. And I doubt people will put up with too much longer before they decide that it's better to get sick than be a prisoner in their own homes for an extended period of time and be a part of an economic depression that makes the Great Depression look like high flying times.
>  The Boston test was at a homeless shelter  You're just making stuff up now. They were random people they stopped on the street out walking around. It was run in Chelsea. And I'm not your research assistant, go google it yourself.
Hardly
C’monnnn - you know facts aren’t allowed!!! They were telling such a great story! /s
The article on boston.com indicates otherwise, and regardless my point stands: a substantial portion of the population doesn't really get sick. Additionally, the groups behind the California studies actually tackle the criticism of their studies in the below NY Times article. And they also happen to mention that other studies done internationally are finding the same. So the reality is this virus thankfully isn't as bad as we thought. And as they mention in the article, you can't judge it by ICU visits.  https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/21/health/coronavirus-antibodies-california.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage
Here's some facts for you.  https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/21/health/coronavirus-antibodies-california.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage
>https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/21/health/coronavirus-antibodies-california.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage  I think the info here demonstrates just how much we don't know and how we are hindered from making informed decisions by a lack a widespread testing. Based on the current models, I think the we are taking the necessary steps. The situation in New York and other global hot spots makes clear the risk we face if we let infection rates outpace the capacity of our healthcare system.  However, it's important to be open to new information. We're now learning there were cases in California much earlier than originally known. It's not entirely unreasonable to speculate that there could also be asymptomatic infection on a wider scale than originally assumed. Until we have reliable and widespread testing, there's too much we don't know to not exercise caution, but the discussion is warranted.
Sure but the whole tale you were spinning in this thread was, uh, not a fact.
If the first sentence says that, I missed it because I was in reader mode and it doesn't show up for me.  > Korea, Australia, Hong Kong, New Zealand  Hong Kong isn't under control, they're back under lockdown. Australia is under lockdown, New Zealand locked down early enough to control it and has banned international travel without a mandatory quarantine. Being a set of islands far away from anything makes that relatively easy, and we're not in that position. Korea did something we didn't: locked down hot spots and stopped travel in and out of them early on. This was something I advocated for from the get go, but we didn't bother doing it and have since watched the virus spread because of it. To this day we actually have counties in this state with zero cases, and the rest of the state is idiotically not locked out from most of them (minus IIRC Graham and Hyde counties). At this point, it's too widespread to be able to eliminate where it is. At this point, we're all going to get it and we just need to let it pass through the population. Now it's a question of how much collateral economic damage do we want to take in the process.  Regarding the Standford study, there are criticisms of it (all of which they acknowledge in the paper!), but there are a number of other studies that are showing the same thing, including the one conducted in LA which had a representative population.
Uhm, no. The whole thing that I've been talking about is confirmed by that article: a lot more people have had it than we ever realized and therefore the death rate is far lower than we thought.  Also, something to bring a bit of clarity to this: you are going to get coronavirus, if you've not had it already. The sooner you realize that, the better.
I’m not worried about getting it, and I’m happy to continue the stay home effort to protect the vulnerable and the front line workers.   Edited: because arguing on the internet with someone advocating to reopen things too early is a waste of time and all that matters is what I wrote above.
I think this fundamentally comes down to you and I see the solution differently. You feel that waiting around for a vaccine/cure is the best route forward. The fact is we have no cure, there's no guarantee of a cure or a vaccine that will work or that the virus won't have mutated to the point that one doesn't work by the time October of 2021 rolls around. The latter is the danger of the post-1976 Swine Flu vaccine doctors have been warned about for 44 years and have done nothing about. We also currently don't really have any signs of re-infection. Those cases that have looked like that have been linked to false negatives on the tests.  For those reasons, I firmly believe the best route forward is herd immunity, with a focus on low-risk populations getting sick to develop it. It also results in far less economic damage. Economic damage is important because suicide rates go up with economic slumps and what we're facing on a vaccine path is a depression that will make the Great Depression (which had a high suicide rate) look like high flying times. The additional problem with lockdowns is that such isolation also leads to suicides and domestic violence (including murder). So the fact is, you're dealing with a lot of death in either scenario, so IMO you might as well just get it over with and move on.

And actually, lets discuss your altruism. I am a member of the vulnerable population due to an underlying heath condition. As such, when I get this virus (and I will), it could kill me. How do you think I want to spend my last days? Locked up at home, or among my friends enjoying myself and my remaining time with them? I assure you it's the latter, and I assure you it's the same for anyone else.
I disagree completely. I am in a high-risk category, and I'm immunocompromised. I would prefer to stay at home with my family and not contract the virus. I can fully work from home, as can my wife.   Please don't "assure" people that it's the same for anyone else.
> Nope, no false negatives here. Family of three all reinfected weeks later.   Doubtful  > Typical Trump supporter garbage.   O_o. No, I'm a political moderate as I don't fit in with either party and somebody who doesn't get obsessed over who's in the White House. I'm also somebody who payed attention in history class, so I know how terrible times were during the Great Depression and that it took a world war to get out of it. For the same reasons, I also know that we won't survive the next world war. But as they say, those who fail to learn from history are doomed to repeat it.  > That would be fine if we had the facts, we don't. No idea if what you are suggesting is even possible.  Well before you're done collecting facts, we can past it. And if herd immunity doesn't work, then a vaccine is going to be worthless as well due to the 18 month approval process combined with viral mutations. It reminds me of the Biologist in Everglades NP who spent years studying the habits of the Burmese Python rather than just killing them. Sometimes you've got to just pull the trigger.
> I would prefer to stay at home with my family  So in other words you're enjoying your (potentially) remaining time with your loved ones.
I guess... but aren't we all? If we HAVE loved ones?  My point is that I disagree with your opinion that we're all going to get it, so get it over with. There is no "Getting over it" until there is a reliable vaccine. There might never be one, and that's a possibility we'll have to adapt to. With the information we have now, filtered through my own brain, "re-opening" the Country is about as misguided as could be.   We WILL see another resurgence. It is all but guaranteed. If I contract this virus, the statistics we have at this point show that I will have a much worse time weathering it than the average person. That information causes me to make the best decisions I possibly can for me and my family. It isn't about "want vs. need". You WANT to go out and interact with others, based on the information we all have, filtered through your brain.   I'm not saying your opinion is wrong. I just disagree with it, and I disagree with you saying "...and I assure you it's the same for anyone else". That's it.
>> O_o. No, I'm a political moderate liar  > FTFQ  Hardly. You simply hate him so much that you can't understand the idea that somebody can possibly be neutral on Trump. There's things he does that I like, there's things he does that I don't like. Plain and simple.  > Someone has never been to the Everglades.   ROTFL. I used to live in South Florida, went to Loxahatchee nearly daily (federal parks membership), Big Cypress on a number of occasions and was in Everglades NP multiple times per year. I've bushwhacked through the sawgrass, slogged through the swamp during the wet season and walked parts of the Florida Trail through there. I actually saw the end of a rainbow at Big Cypress (the Irish are full of shit, btw).  > The pythons escaped in a hurricane and were released. No way to track them and kill them all in a huge swamp.   He was practicing a catch and release program for a while, not neutering females, stuff like that.  > That said I have actually caught and killed Burmese in the Everglades. I am not a fan of taking a life, but they are invasive and they are harming the native wildlife.  On this we can agree.
