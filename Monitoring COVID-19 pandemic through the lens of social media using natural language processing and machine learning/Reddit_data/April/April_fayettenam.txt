Fayetteville mayor to implement city-wide curfew Wednesday to combat COVID-19

Hope Mills needs to do this too.
And what exactly will this do to stop disease? You're condensing when people can leave their homes, which will lead to larger crowds. It's not about disease, it's about control. You're just as easily infected during the day as you are at night.
Just like my dear mother used to say: Nothing good happens after midnight. If it'll keep the drunks, druggies, pimps and hookers off the street during the hours when decent people and families are asleep, I support it 100%.

Diamond and Silk: The five biggest lies about Trump’s handling of COVID-19

2, 3 and 4 are fine. But I have the biggest problems with 1 and 5. 5 is entirely hypothetical and there’s no proof for either argument on if he would do better or not - unless you completely ignore all the stuff that Trump did leading up to this virus. You would have to assume Biden would have done the exact same things Trump has done to lead up to this. There’s no way that would happen. 1 claims that they’ve taken his words out of context but there’s no quote of the EXACT words he said before, during, or after that claim. Here’s what I could find him saying:  “And this is their new hoax. but you know we’ve done something that’s been pretty amazing. We have 15 people in this massive country, and because of the fact that we went early, we went early - we could have had a lot more than that and we will do everything in our power to keep the infection and those carrying the infection into our country, we have no choice.”

Diamond and Silk: The five biggest Democratic lies about Trump’s handling of COVID-19

Why tf is The Fayetteville Observer publishing this?
lol they're paid by the Trump campaign:  https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/diamond-silk-trump-campaign-paid-fec-filing-shows/story?id=54747367

Hardaway and Richards--aka Diamond and Silk--are entertainers and campaign surrogates. You should think carefully about whether they are reliable sources.   **1. D&S Write: Donald Trump never called COVID-19 “a hoax.”**  *He did so on 2/28/20.*  > President Donald Trump said Friday that Democrats are using the virulent coronavirus as a “hoax” to damage him and his administration.  > “The Democrats are politicizing the coronavirus,” he said from a campaign rally in North Charleston, South Carolina.  > “One of my people came up to me and said ‘Mr. President they tried to beat you on Russia, Russia, Russia. That didn’t work out too well.’ They couldn’t do it. They tried the impeachment hoax that was on a perfect conversation,” he continued.  > “This is their new hoax,” he said, referring to the coronavirus.  https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-calls-democrats-coronavirus-criticism-a-new-hoax  **2. D&S write:  Restrictions on travel from China are rooted in science, not “xenophobia.”**  When someone says, "x happened because y," the burden is on the proponent of a proposition to show evidence regarding the causal chain.   *D&S provide no evidence to support their claim.*  **3. D&S write: The President did not “muzzle” Dr. Fauci.**  [He did so on, for example, on 4/5/20.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/04/06/coronavirus-fauci-trumpdrugs/):  > Toward the end, a CNN reporter turned to Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, for his opinion on the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine with a sharper question: “What is the medical evidence?”  > Standing at the microphone, Fauci opened his mouth — but before he could speak, the answer came out of Trump’s instead.  > “Do you know how many times he’s answered that question?” Trump cut in. “Maybe 15.”  > A tight smile stretched across Fauci’s face. His eyes, framed by a pair of wire-rimmed glasses, flicked quickly to Trump. He glanced back at the reporter, who was saying to the president, “The question is for the doctor. … He’s your medical expert, correct?”  > Fauci’s smile, for just a moment, was all teeth now. Trump raised his finger sternly, telling the journalist, “You don’t have to ask the question,” and so Fauci didn’t answer it, and the news conference shuffled right along.  **D&S write: 4. Remember that shocking footage of a crowded U.S. hospital? It was a lie.**  *It was an editing mistake, according to the D&S themselves.* Regardless, many US hospitals are facing [staffing shortages](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/3/31/21201281/coronavirus-staffing-shortage-governors-health-care-workers-help), [lack of ventilators](https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/02/politics/donald-trump-ventilators-leadership-coronavirus/index.html) and [morgues](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/30/us/brooklyn-hospital-coronavirus-patients-deaths/index.html), and lack of [personal protective equipment](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nurses-protest-ppe-shortages-15-hospitals/). We're [digging mass graves](https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2020/apr/10/aerial-video-shows-mass-grave-on-new-york-citys-hart-island-amid-coronavirus-surge-video).  Of course, the important issue isn't whether one particular instance of editing was misleading, it's whether we're facing a general shortfall in our ability to treat Covid-19 patients.  And, of course, we [lack good numbers](https://www.propublica.org/article/we-still-dont-know-how-many-people-are-in-the-hospital-with-covid-19) about how many there are--because the Trump Administration isn't putting them together.  **5. D&S write: No, “Sleepy Joe” would not have handled this crisis better than President Trump.**  Counterfactual history is difficult under the best of conditions, but generally an argument would require listing specific factual evidence, rather than value-based conclusions. D&S provide no such evidence; their conclusion is thus wholly unsupported.  That said: the [US is among the the worst, if not the very worst](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/covid-confirmed-deaths-since-5th-death?), at containing the Coronavirus. If only because Biden 's performance would more closely resemble the average response (revert to the mean), he'd probably have done better than Trump.
Let me go ahead and listen to medical professionals diamond and silk.  These 2 would say anything they are paid to say
They're from Hoke County. This belongs on the Raeford Reddit. Mods!!!!

The Observer's job is to report facts, and every bit of this is the truth. Don't hate the messengers, D&S and just telling it like it is.
Get yourself and your damn irrefutable facts out of here, now.
They speak the truth. It makes no difference if they're not doctors as long as the truth is being spoken. I'm going to consider getting a subscription to the Observer if they continue to publish quality content like this. I unsubscribed long ago, but might reconsider now.
And the other facts presented in this thread? Or are you just burying your head in the sand about those?

The coronavirus hoax: Event 201 conspiracy, deceit, and the New World Order

You are now crowned the literal dumbest person in this entire sub.
Perhaps it's the mods doing the trolling? Or maybe that's a conspiracy theory I just invented.
U need to open ur eyes to what's going on in the world around you. Unless u want to have an intelligent debate, u can refrain from posting on my thread. K thanks.
None of that is “intelligent”. The proof they link to try and back up their claims is 99% linked to their own articles. I bet if you asked them why they don’t provide sources to ANYWHERE else proving their claims, they would say that the liberal global elite controlled media is wrong and only they are right. You’re being played by them and you can’t even see it. Maybe when you actually post something intelligent then it will actually create intelligent discourse, but this is just hot garbage with no proof that it’s correct.   https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/feb/03/facebook-posts/these-plushies-do-not-commemorate-2019-novel-coron/

Where to find updated coronavirus rules and regulations for NC, Cumberland, Hoke, Robeson counties etc etc?
I can't keep up with the rules and how they keep constantly changing what ppl are allowed and aint allowed to do in this state. Where do you folks find accurate and up to date information about what citizens can do and what's not allowed? I'm finding nothing but conflicting and vauge information at all the places I'm checked.
https://fayettevillenc.gov/government/city-departments/corporate-communications/covid-19-information  Has information and links for what you are looking for, like what businesses are closed, required behaviors like distancing and masks in public places, etc.
Why not just post a reply where everyone who is interested can see it instead of sending a private message?
