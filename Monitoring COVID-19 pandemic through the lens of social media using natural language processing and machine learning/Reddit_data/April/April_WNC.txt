COVID-19 Testing Now Available at Mercy Urgent Care

COVID-19 testing is now available at Mercy Urgent Care. The short version is that you schedule a telemedicine visit and are referred for testing from your car. At this time, testing is not recommended for those with no symptoms. See their website for details.  https://mercyurgentcare.org/news/information-regarding-covid-19/

Nursing Home/ Large Residential Care: List of Facility Names, County, Number/Cases, Number/Death [COVID-19 Outbreak]

It's excellent that they made this accessible by having an ASL interpreter... However I question the logic of putting the person that will be understood just fine regardless of their visual presence front and center while making the guy that *must* be seen to be understood teeny tiny in the corner.   What is this, an interpreter for ants??!
The numbers are so painfully skewed and meaningless at this point I'm not sure how much impact something like this has. Sure, I'm glad to see the data, but is it reliable? How many residents passed away and then weren't tested because tests were deemed too valuable to use on the dead. Just looking at at obituaries across the state's newspapers its easy to see there is a fairly dramatic uptick in elderly deaths compares with years prior, but the state is still reporting only 306 deaths at the time I am writing this comment. The truth of the situation is elderly patients passing away in the community or in homes that haven't been tested are not being tested after they die and horribly skewing the numbers.

Carolina Public Press: Are counties without confirmed COVID-19 cases testing anyone?

Yancey EMS director stated that there are definitely cases although none have been officially reported. Healthcare services are sparse in Yancey so I wouldn't doubt that many things slip through the cracks.

But the shaded area is essentially the margin of error for the prediction, so we’ve got a wide range between not exceeding capacity and dramatically exceeding it - which would mean a spike in the mortality rate.What does this tell us? It tells us **we still have the time and ability** to minimize the loss of life in our state.To be blunt: We are not going to have widespread testing. There are lots of reasons for that - none of which have to do with our state and all of which have to do with the federal response - but it’s a reality. We’re still using tests and they're very important, but we're not going to test our way out of this like South Korea did. We just didn't get enough test kits fast enough.But - despite that major setback - it’s still possible to minimize the loss of life in our state by making sure we don’t max out the ICU beds. We just have to take social distancing very seriously for the next several weeks. In this model, OUR BEHAVIOR is the biggest variable. How seriously WE take this will ultimately determine the mortality rate.**Quick List*** We’ve only received 17% of the PPE that we requested from the federal government. That’s not good, and it’s why we’re sourcing from everywhere we can find and working with North Carolina manufacturers to switch production to PPE if at all possible.* The state’s unemployment insurance website and call center are still facing a nightmarish traffic jam as they get slammed with 50x the normal traffic, but we are adding servers and contracted with an additional call center to help field calls. If you’re having serious trouble, please fill out this customer contact form: [https://des.nc.gov/customer-contact-form](https://des.nc.gov/customer-contact-form).* Regarding the federal unemployment benefit that just passed, it will be administered by the state. We’re still waiting on implementation guidance from the federal Department of Labor, at which point benefits will be paid in about two weeks. Independent contractors and people who are self-employed will qualify for the federal benefit - they do not currently qualify for the state benefit. I know the state website isn’t set up to receive applications from people who are contractors or self-employed and that’s part of what we need to fix. If you fall into this category, just file the application as best you can.* Gov. Cooper’s new executive order means no one can shut off your electricity, gas, or water for at least the next 60 days.* The U.S. Corps of Engineers is helping us scout for places that could be used as hospital expansions.* We've launched a hotline to help critical workers connect with child care (888-600-1685).More updates soon,Sen. Jeff Jackson
Thank you, Senator Jackson.
Can you explain why you think NC will peak at the same as NY? Don't you think NC is trailing behind time-wise?
u/JeffJacksonNC, as a self-employed person, is there *any* possible downside to applying for unemployment now? I know your post says to go ahead, but in my mind if the application isn’t set up for it and I’m just hoping for the best that I’m answering correctly, it seems like that could be potentially adverse to my chances of being approved. I’m also afraid to wait or hesitate to apply because I don’t know if the funds will last or be available later.
