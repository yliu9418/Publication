I would call the health department and get the free one. No mention of health insurance.
What do you mean by that in relation to the information in the article?
You could be charged the doctors office fee or some other fee, just not the test kit.   The legislators couldn’t figure it out except for those who don’t have health insurance (or omit that information).  It’s part of the trillion dollars in legislation to get tested. We all should benefit.
