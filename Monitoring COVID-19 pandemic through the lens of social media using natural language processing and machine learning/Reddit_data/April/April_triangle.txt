Please help me get my PhD! Need Research Participants for Dissertation Study due to COVID-19 halting in-person data collection. (Need either a VR headset or a Windows Computer to participate)
 Summary: Are you bored and looking for something to do during the quarantine? Participate in a research study on digital communication and social interactions! I am looking for both VR users and people who own a Windows computer to participate in an hour-long study to help me finish up my dissertation research at NCSU.Details: Hi Everyone! I hope you are all staying safe and sane during this quarantine! So COVID-19 meant I had to halt data collection for my dissertation research which compares different communication mediums (e.g., computer vs VR vs face-to-face) in terms of communication, social presence, and feelings of connection. I have altered the VR and computer conditions to be completely online, but now I need participants who own a VR headset at home, which are very hard to come by, or have a windows computer at home with at least an i5 core processor and 4 GB of RAM. If you own a VR headset or Windows computer and have about an hour to spare, I would greatly appreciate your help!   For a full list of eligibility requirements and what the study entails, please see the recruitment flyer (link here: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mkREuQ-NYC0xHzmivkZ6qrcuI8lVEf6n/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mkREuQ-NYC0xHzmivkZ6qrcuI8lVEf6n/view?usp=sharing).If I sparked your interest and you would like to sign up for the study, here is a link to the scheduler survey [https://ncsu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\_d3RO8yx8WPdnaiF](https://ncsu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_d3RO8yx8WPdnaiF).Stay safe everybody!Note: I've had a couple of people ask me about the 20/20 corrected or natural vision requirement so I'll go ahead and answer that question here. :) Basically, you can participate if you wear glasses or contacts, I just ask that you are wearing them during the study. If your vision doesn't correct totally to 20/20 but it's pretty close and you can still see everything pretty well, that is fine too.
I just signed up.  I didn't see anything in the requirements about user location so I assume you can have people from all over the country/world.  If that is the case, I would recommend posting in r/OculusQuest and other VR subs.  The VR community is very active and they love participating in stuff like this.  Good Luck!
Hi! Thanks so much for letting me know and for signing up! I really appreciate it! Great tip :)

Cat Adoption during Covid-19
Does anyone know of any groups that are still letting folks adopt cats in the area?
I think wake county spca is still doing adoptions, they keep making Facebook posts about their animals. We got our cat there and it is by far one of the cheapest and easiest places in the area.
https://animalrescue.net  Try this group. Not the cheapest but a great organization.
Alley cats and angels is doing foster to adopt ([https://alleycatsandangels.org/](https://alleycatsandangels.org/))  My GF fosters for them and they are trying everything they can to make sure their cats get homes.
I just adopted my first cat ever, found her through Petfinder.com!
I think Wake County is still doing adoptions one person at a time.
APS of Durham
I rescue cats and have a female kitten for adoption. She’s about 9 mths old. You can find our group on FB called Cats on the Horizon. Please DM me if interested.   Heather
Orange County Animal Shelter and APS of Durham are both doing adoptions by appointment.
They will talk to you by phone and help move the process along but they are closed for adoptions until at least April 29th per the COVID update on their website:  https://spcawake.org/updates/
Thanks for the tip! I applied to adopt one of their cats on Tuesday and I'm still waiting to hear from them, but hopefully it goes smoothly once I do.

Are you making extra hand made masks? Do you have a 3D printer idling around? Do you just have a car and want to help deliver or pickup supplies? Help crush COVID-19
Check out our website here: [https://trianglecovid.com/](https://trianglecovid.com/) I am trying to organize all the DIY enthusiasts in the area and stay out of their way.  We are using [slack](https://join.slack.com/t/masksfordocs/shared_invite/zt-dcwc740h-jZtGkDZl8NMGUKzgRXX56g) as the primary way of communicating with each other.  We are handing completed face shields directly to medical staff in the area from multiple hospitals and health care facilities.  I am stepping up to do this based off of what I saw from Smarter Everyday in Huntsville Alabama ([https://huntsvillefightingcovid.com/](https://huntsvillefightingcovid.com/)) and was inspired by my co-workers, neighbors and this Youtube video here: [https://youtu.be/sbEj7M3aZIg](https://youtu.be/sbEj7M3aZIg)Please forward on to friends!
Don't forget about nursing homes and prisons, the need for literally anything is so great and they are so at risk.
I have a 3D printer as well. If you can confirm that hospitals are using the prints, I'll make some.
Awesome! Please reach out to Activate Good and show them this! They're amazing at getting an army of people to help and could be an awesome partnership to work together. :)
Currently printing NIH approved surgical mask tension release bands. [https://3dprint.nih.gov/collections/covid-19-response](https://3dprint.nih.gov/collections/covid-19-response) Have local hospitals been accepting the face shields you all are producing? If so, count me in on printing. Will connect.
Many of us are also making [ear savers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QoC5GjZEYo). I just delivered 200 to a couple local places here in Cary.  I have an .svg file for those that want to make these as well.
Can't print, but have medical training and am willing to drive.
Would there be interest in crocheted bands with buttons to help relieve ears of mask straps?
Are NC hospitals accepting (and using) fabric madks? I know we only received a fraction of requested PPE from national stock, but I hadn't heard anything about dropoff points since before stay at home.
Hit me up if you need stuff transported in or around Durham.
Aye out of Greensboro but will drive to help
I'm not such a great craftsperson these days, but I can certainly transport stuff around and get it to where it's needed.
You may also want to collaborate with the nc chapter of https://facemaskwarriors.com/
any recommendations on a 3d printer and related supplies to buy?
I am trying to do deliveries this week to nursing homes, thanks for the idea.  After reading some horrible news this week in Chatham county I am concentrating on nursing homes because I think they are being forgotten about.
not just hospitals, we are delivering to clinics all over the Triangle, nursing homes, in-home nurses, etc.  There is a lot of demand and lots of front line workers wants our support.
Bump - SAME! :) If they're approved and being used, I'm 100% onboard and ready to print.
Do you know them? Can you put us in touch?
the hospitals have been accepting gear, but they are starting to look better and better.  I am starting to concentrate on delivering to nursing homes, non-profits, traveling nurses and other forgotten front line workers that main-line manufactures have not gotten to.  I am literally just trying to coordinate DIY enthusiasts and stay out of their way.  I promise if you print masks I will get them to someone that will use them.
Do you need help coordinating that?  I can add that to the website and try to help coordinate who would want it.
Printing ear savers currently. Specifically these: [https://3dprint.nih.gov/discover/3dpx-013410](https://3dprint.nih.gov/discover/3dpx-013410) Which local places need them the most? I'll start dropping them off as well.
I’m not a healthcare worker, but I would think something easily washable/sanitizable might be preferable to a crocheted item. Tho I might be ignorant in caring for crocheted pieces.
do you have pictures of what that looks like, I am unfamiliar with what that is.
I have two people at UNC REX who say “no” and more than likely will not accept any non medical grade.  The goal here is to hopefully reduce the strain on PPE for non-medical purposes.  I had 400 N95 masks unopened because I do quite a bit of sanding wood working and was able to buy em in bulk 6 mos ago.  Delivered them to WakeMed last week.
At wakemed we can wear homemade masks. I don't think hospitals will accept for staff because they need to come from the staff, but if you can track down somebody, they can bring them in to distribute.  And if you could spread the word about available masks there would definitely be interest!
We received most of the N95's requested (443,700/500,000), and more procedure masks than requested (598,000/500,000)  [https://www.ncdhhs.gov/divisions/public-health/covid19/covid-19-nc-case-count#ppe](https://www.ncdhhs.gov/divisions/public-health/covid19/covid-19-nc-case-count#ppe)
But understanding is not currently but I created a request form to start tracking if people were requesting that on the website
can you sign up here-> https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfZx-SiNOc5RA7--WYxWHC8CGoSClUd32812pYfybBYzHsBUg/viewform  that way I can add you to the emails
There is some other folks in the triad you could join on slack and coordinate with but we will take any help :)
I would recommend joining the slack group I advertise on http://trianglecovid.com/ (masksfordocs) because I am a total newb.  I have an ender-3 and it works fine.  If I had more money I would buy a Prusa https://www.prusa3d.com/
100% being used. We're delivering our 500th shield today. If you need more information I wrote a blog post and a friend just made a YouTube video explaining it that Sean and I are in.   https://blog.ktz.me/3d-printed-covid-19-face-shields/
How would you recommend someone who doesn't have a printer but is comfortable with tech/diy to get started?
Yep! Pm me your contact info.
I went to multiple elder care facilities and dropped them off.  I am always concerned in dropping things like these off for first responders or medical professionals because they may need medical grade items.  Oh, I also wiped each of mine off and put them in a sterile bag (which I also wiped off) before dropping them off.  It’s probably overkill, but who knows at this point.
Cotton can be washed, even bleached
Sent you in chat
That's good to hear! Looks like y'all are a bit short on the gown front. After masks, what are you guys hard up for or anticipating a shortage of?
Done. Thanks!
Cool! Joined up on Slack and am printing the frames now - hope to have a stack of them for you soon.
Great idea with the elder care facilities!
Color me wrong about that then!
Yeah, it seems they’re being hit hard with all of this and while I’d love to help hospitals, I think the elder care facilities are ones that are being overlooked a bit.  Oh also, you cannot enter most of these places.  So I called in advance, and left the package on the sidewalks in front of their places and called them after to let them know to pick it up.

I'm a journalism student doing a package on the developments of the Reopen NC organizer revealing to have had COVID-19. I would like to interview some people with their thoughts on it.

I understand that as a student, you cannot select your assignments. I can connect you with level headed individuals in the Stay Home NC movement so that you can get quotes from people who are impacted by the loss of their business due to the stay home order, but still aren't rushing to reopen when it is imprudent to do so.  I will stay this, exactly no one in the Stay Home NC group is the least bit surprised by any of the developments taking place in the Reopen NC movement. We long ago traced their funding, as you should also do given that you are a journalist, and understand that the funders have specific outcomes they are hoping for which these developments connect with.

But the shaded area is essentially the margin of error for the prediction, so we’ve got a wide range between not exceeding capacity and dramatically exceeding it - which would mean a spike in the mortality rate.What does this tell us? It tells us **we still have the time and ability** to minimize the loss of life in our state.To be blunt: We are not going to have widespread testing. There are lots of reasons for that - none of which have to do with our state and all of which have to do with the federal response - but it’s a reality. We’re still using tests and they're very important, but we're not going to test our way out of this like South Korea did. We just didn't get enough test kits fast enough.But - despite that major setback - it’s still possible to minimize the loss of life in our state by making sure we don’t max out the ICU beds. We just have to take social distancing very seriously for the next several weeks. In this model, OUR BEHAVIOR is the biggest variable. How seriously WE take this will ultimately determine the mortality rate.**Quick List*** We’ve only received 17% of the PPE that we requested from the federal government. That’s not good, and it’s why we’re sourcing from everywhere we can find and working with North Carolina manufacturers to switch production to PPE if at all possible.* The state’s unemployment insurance website and call center are still facing a nightmarish traffic jam as they get slammed with 50x the normal traffic, but we are adding servers and contracted with an additional call center to help field calls. If you’re having serious trouble, please fill out this customer contact form: [https://des.nc.gov/customer-contact-form](https://des.nc.gov/customer-contact-form).* Regarding the federal unemployment benefit that just passed, it will be administered by the state. We’re still waiting on implementation guidance from the federal Department of Labor, at which point benefits will be paid in about two weeks. Independent contractors and people who are self-employed will qualify for the federal benefit - they do not currently qualify for the state benefit. I know the state website isn’t set up to receive applications from people who are contractors or self-employed and that’s part of what we need to fix. If you fall into this category, just file the application as best you can.* Gov. Cooper’s new executive order means no one can shut off your electricity, gas, or water for at least the next 60 days.* The U.S. Corps of Engineers is helping us scout for places that could be used as hospital expansions.* We've launched a hotline to help critical workers connect with child care (888-600-1685).STAY STRONG. We can do this.More updates soon,Sen. Jeff Jackson
Senator,  Let me first say I really appreciate you doing this.  I am concerned that we tightened our testing requirements and are now only testing people that are seriously ill.  With companies like LabCorp in the area, I'd think we would be capable of ramping up, not forced to slow down.  We are effectively losing information we could use to fight the virus, projecting what is coming next, and I'd imagine requests to the federal government for aide have some weight on number of cases the state is dealing with currently (rightfully so).  &#x200B;  I'm also concerned about test turn around times.  I have a loved one that works in a hospital and the tests for their patients are taking 7 days to come back.  They wear limited PPE.  Supplies are already becoming an issue.    &#x200B;  Hopefully I'm wrong, but I feel like **increasing testing** would allow us access to more supplies and funding from the federal government, and give us a better understanding of who has the virus, which allows us to know who their direct contacts are so they can monitor themselves more closely and bring the spread to a halt.  .
Jeff, I don't even live in the state anymore but I follow the sub and want to tell you what an outstanding job you're doing communicating ongoing developments. You understand that this is an important venue for information and are serving NC Redditors admirably. Keep it up!
Thank you so much for these constant updates.
This may be on the bottom of some people’s minds, but my car property tax payment is due end of May and there is NO way I’m going to get an inspection right now unless there’s a way to do it without leaving my car or letting anyone else in it.   Is there any plan to give extensions on stuff like this? I would be happy to just pay it and forgo the inspection, but as you may know, that’s not an option.
Appreciate the effort in formatting and presentation of post!
Thanks for sharing the numbers and predictions with us. I saw a news article that the Bay Area in Ca is making really good progress in terms of infection rates due to compliance with shelter in place orders. Hopefully we can do the same. It's great to see that our projections are hopeful rather than bleak but perhaps a little frightening to hear that there is no plan C, as an immunocompromised person. I hope we all get through this ok. I look forward to your no-nonsense updates.
Senator, thank you for your continued updates. At what point do you think we have to have enforcement of people who are not taking the situation seriously enough? While your numbers regarding capacity are somewhat encouraging, wouldn’t it be beneficial to recommend stricter guidelines? For example only one person per household to gather essential items as needed? If someone in the household is showing symptoms, to have a plan in place on where that person is to be quarantined? Also it would be helpful to inform people in severe cases what actually happens to these cases where a person is in need of a ventilator? Getting the point across that this virus is nothing like people have seen before. Not to cause panic but to inform people of the risk they face by becoming complacent.
/u/JeffJacksonNC I'd ask you to run for president, but we need you here.  Thank you for providing clear, concise and honest data.
Can we get pitchforks to shake at the federal government yet...or..?
That graph looks pretty damn linear to me for the past week or so, just sayin'.
You're absolutely right. Everyone agrees. We should definitely increase testing. But we just don't have the capacity, and we won't in time to flatten the curve. So it's all on social distancing. We're on to Plan B and there is no Plan C.
I usually just get it inspected and pay for the property tax whenever I get around to it. I doubt if I've ever paid it on time. I don't think the penalty is all that harsh for paying the property tax late.
This. Just got one for the wife’s car. Growl.
My SO and I are in the same boat but mine is end of this month :(
Likewise. I failed the first one, can't get it fixed now, and as of 2 days ago running on expired tags.   NCDOT told me I'm out of luck and recommended I get the inspection "safely" and to pay the taxes now. Which you can't do until you successfully complete an inspection. I was told it'd require a meeting of the General Assembly, which doesn't appear to be happening, so anything they pass would be retroactive (like waiving late fees, tickets received for expire tags, etc.)
Agreed.
Senator,  You claim that South Korea tested their way out of this. How can you reconcile this with the fact that they tested about 0.6% of their population? Their success didn't really have anything to do with test availability, did it? Then couldn't we have achieved the same result had state government acted sooner rather than sitting around for two months accusing the federal government of racism?
“Stay safe. Unless you have to pay taxes, then do whatever it takes.”  Thanks, government. 😞
South Korea was able to test everyone who had symptoms. That’s what matters. We never have. Not even now. You can have the symptoms and have a negative flu test and still not get a test.
News media is widely reporting that up to 50% of infected are asymptomatic. Frankly I doubt that number very much, but doesn't this deal yet another blow to your theory that South Korea tested their way out of this (and thus that this crisis is entirely the fault of the federal government)? That is, if they were only testing those with symptoms, shouldn't the virus have continued to spread due to the asymptomatic?  Isn't the only true, relevant difference between South Korea and NC that the former didn't spend two months clutching its pearls and pointing fingers?
I didn't get the impression that's what the senator meant at all. He was simply stating a fact-- the test kits aren't going to be here in time to follow the same model that S. Korea did so we have to use a different strategy.
> News media is widely reporting that up to 50% of infected are asymptomatic.   I think you're getting opinions made using news if you don't know where the number came from.  Moreover, you're stuck in the logical fallacy that infection rate is a flat line.  SK tested 0.6% because that's all they needed to do, because they were doing this early in the game.  They found the infected to slow/stop the spread.  It would be the equivalent of every state testing more than what they have test for now, when we found out there was an outbreak in NY and WA, in February.  That, is why it's entirely the federal government's fault.

Didn't know Branford Marsalis lived in the Triangle. Learned from Coronavirus related passing of his father.
Condolences to their family.Taken from WRAL:  [https://www.wral.com/coronavirus/live-nc-coronavirus-updates/19039133/](https://www.wral.com/coronavirus/live-nc-coronavirus-updates/19039133/) **8 a.m.:** Legendary jazz musician [Ellis Marsalis Jr. died late Wednesday after battling COVID-19](https://www.wral.com/new-orleans-jazz-patriarch-ellis-marsalis-dead-at-85/19038877/). The virus caused pneumonia, which ultimately caused his death.Marsalis was a jazz pianist, teacher and patriarch of a New Orleans musical clan. He was 85 years old and leaves behind six sons.One of his famous sons, Branford Marsalis, is a resident of Durham and has performed extensively throughout the Triangle – at Duke University and the State Fair, as well as with the North Carolina Jazz Repertory Orchestra.
Yep, he's been around for a while. I remember seeing him years ago at the All People's Grill up Guess road in Durham, he joined in a jam session with Cool John Ferguson. He used to play at the Beyu Caffe in Durham as well, back when they did music more often.
I've seen him play with Bruce Hornsby in Cary and The Dead at Walnut Creek (not the Grateful Dead, the reunited group going by that name at that time).  Neither of these were announced, he just showed up and played for almost the entire show.
When he moved to the area I remember my Dad taking me to a free two hour seminar he was holding on Duke's campus. Because I was a saxophone player my Dad thought I could get some knowledge shared from a master saxophonist. I basically was so intimated I just couldn't ask any questions. He was very nice and I think mainly everyone came just to hear him play, although I think he just wanted to answer questions. He did bring is sax and played some for us though. Sad to hear of his dad passing.
as far as I can remember he's lived in Durham for the past 20 years or so
He's lived in Durham for almost 20 years. I had the pleasure of seeing the entire Marsalis family (Except Wynton) perform at Jazzfest in New Orleans in 2002. The dad was on the piano and the sons, Branford included, accompanied him on various instruments. Branford also made a surprise appearance at a Trombone Shorty concert in Raleigh 2 years ago. Sad day.
Oh gosh that would have electric to hear.
Close to that at least. First I saw him, he was a surprise guest at a Victor Wooten show at Cat’s Cradle back in 2002-03.
The whole Marsalis family is musical. Trombone Shorty is the same I believe. Grandfather was a band leader and several other family members are accomplished.  No parade through New Orleans to say goodbye.

Resources for business affected by coronavirus
This is an unprecedented time for everyone in North Carolina and with the statewide stay-at-home order, businesses everywhere are struggling to keep their doors open. Here is a list of resources for businesses in North Carolina that may be able to help some business owners. It's a list of loans available, how to file an unemployment insurance claim, new family and medical leave rules, and even how to begin producing PPE to support healthcare workers. With all the uncertainty floating around about the economy and our state, hopefully this list can answer some questions for people and start connecting them to resources that can help.Business Resources: https://edpnc.com/covid-19-resources/

Dr fauci addressed something like this a few days ago regarding a tiger at a zoo getting it.  No I am not making it up, it happend and fauci talked about at a white house corona brief because of course it came up. I cant recall if it was press r trump buut both made comments about it.   He seemd to belive the zoo keeper handles food for tiger. Zookeeper is postive and passes it too tiger.  There is no evidence transmissioon can happpen the other way.  Does not mean it can not or wont or is not, means they dont have anything leading them to think that at this time.   https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/06/nyregion/bronx-zoo-tiger-coronavirus.html

Sir this is a Wendy’s drive thru
Is this true?
You tried man...
Ironic username
Zoonosis is not as easy as it may sound, it is also unlikely that animals that get it can transmit back to humans under normal circumstances.
Every time people say they look cute I show them a picture of what a pug's skull looks like.  It's bonkers.
My sister had a pug for one day and its eyeball popped out of its socket, seriously so gross...obviously emergency vet visit and got one of those, well the dogs not exactly designed right and this is common so expect it to happen again.  never ever would I recommend a pug
Yes, it's true. This man has no dick.
Yes, human sacrifice is a known symptom of covid-19
Did he, though?
I think all cases found in cats and dogs have been mild and they have not found transmission back to humans.
That's give me anxiety just looking at the photos :( :(
They were a comic martyr. I’ll never forget them.
The fact is coronaviruses as a entity have always exhausted in our four legged friends, the thing that’s different now is the virus has mutated to the point of exposure to humans which has never happened with covid viruses before. That’s what makes this one so unique. It’s ability to fight the white blood cells In your body is a constant excellerant, it’s mutating every single day
