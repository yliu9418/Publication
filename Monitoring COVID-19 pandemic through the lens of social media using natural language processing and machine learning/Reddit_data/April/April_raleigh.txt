Google's COVID-19 Mobility Report - Wake County (March 29)

Looking at the report for Wake county and if I'm reading this right, it appears the stay at home order isn't having a whole lot of effect. But the roads do seem emptier than this data would seem to suggest. (although the same number of idiot drivers seem to be out there)   Only down 43% for workplace and 51% for retail and recreation  Those are disappointing numbers if correct.
I wonder how many people represented in the charts opted in (or realized they opted in) to have their every move tracked and published online (and provided to the government).
Probably a ton. If you have the Google App or Google Maps and have location services turned on, they‚Äôre tracking your data. And I‚Äôm sure everyone read the 27 page Privacy Policy before clicking ‚ÄúYes, install.‚Äù :)

It would be TIGHT if you fixed your unemployment site. It tells me to call and the phone tells me to use the website for an issue I have to speak to someone about. My benefits are being held and it‚Äôs been like this for weeks. I‚Äôm still having to do my weekly certifications and as luck would have it, mine glitched, told me to call for assistance, and then DELETED EVERYTHING, so now I have some log in info. So if you really want to help us, fix that shit. I applied almost a month ago, friends who applied last week are receiving  money. I have $15 a past due phone bill and about to starve and be unable to contact you in a few days(as if trying to non stop for hours today was any success)

Redditors who have gone on unemployment due to covid-19, have you gotten the federal $600 weekly plus state benefits?
There seems to be a ton of controversy regarding whether or not people are getting weekly unemployment from the federal government in addition to state unemployment, but I don‚Äôt anyone personally who‚Äôs gotten a check yet. Can anyone chip in here?
I‚Äôm pretty sure the week starts today, meaning you won‚Äôt get the $600 until 7 days from now. I could be wrong
New York, Connecticut, Virginia, and Texas started getting theirs yesterday
Just got back paid for three weeks but no $600 bonus yet
I don‚Äôt know anyone who‚Äôs gotten a damn thing from the system they‚Äôve paid into their entire working life.
The website says the extra $600 starts for the week of April 4. I applied on March 16 and got paid for the first two weeks last Friday.
I ask people too, no one including me has gotten. $600 WA state here ,even checked my esd.gov benefits getting normal amounts no enhanced, DID they Lie about STIMULUS package ?

Supporting local retailers during COVID-19?
Anyone have a recommendation for local businesses that are shipping their goods during COVID? Thanks!
Quail Ridge Books is offering free media mail on all orders.   Craft Habit is also shipping orders
Edge of Urge
Mythical Inferno hot sauce. Just got my first bottle yesterday
The Green Monkey is shipping orders or offering curbside pickup
Media mail - the stay-in-place order will be over long before you get your book.
Does media mail take an incredibly long time? I was thinking of ordering from them too. I don‚Äôt mind if it take several weeks though, I have other books to read first. Just wanted to support a local book store.
My order shipped on Monday & arrived on Thursday. I had to wait a couple extra days from when I placed my order because the book wasn‚Äôt in stock. It was not a bad wait
Under normal circumstances it varies but it's kind of a 'best effort' timeline. Right now with people being at home and lots more deliveries I would think it was take longer. Don't let my comment stop you, try it and report back.
Great, thanks!

NC COVID-19 Deaths (as of Apr 9th)


hi!! i wanted to see if i would be allowed to post a gofundme for my cat? she‚Äôs a year and a half, and managed to swallow an entire screw. i‚Äôm out of work because of covid-19 and she had to have emergency surgery the day before easter! i really need all the help i can get :(

Have you checked out Care Credit? It will give you time to pay your vet bill. Most are interest free for 6 to 12 months. Good luck w/ your fur baby.
Chipped in $25. Good luck, Lou. I had a cat that eventually we had to baggie up and take our dental floss out to the curb. Cats, man!
I believe that r/Assistance is really helpful too. Hope your cat is doing better since the surgery  Edit: typo
Post it, I‚Äôll kick in some dollars.
I don‚Äôt have spare cash right now, but I signal boosted on social media. Good luck!! I‚Äôm glad Lou is okay.
You should post this in r/cats and other cat related subreddits. they are full of cat lovers who would probably love to help.
Kicked in a couple dollars. We just had to put my 10yr old outdoor cat down a month ago and it was the hardest thing I‚Äôve had to do. Simply because we couldn‚Äôt afford the emergency vet prices and there was no guarantee that he would‚Äôve survived anyway.   I‚Äôm really hope you‚Äôre cat is okay! Hope you‚Äôre doing well and the situation with your work gets better!
‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èdonated. Hope your baby gets well soon!
My kitten was at the emergency vet for 3 days with a urinary blockage, so I'm so sorry, I know how tough this is :( Donated, good luck!
I am fundamentally opposed to gofundme taking their cut, but I would be more than happy to venmo you some dollars if you DM me.
i‚Äôll post it in the comments and if i need to take it down i will!!!    https://www.gofundme.com/f/my-stupid-cat-lou-ate-a-screw
Donated. Our cat passed away right before the lockdown. :( Hope yours is doing well. Cute kitty.
Dm me the link please.
Baby... ;;-;; She's so cute...  I'm not sure enough to say though, so you should message one of the mods to check what the policy is.
Good luck! We just endured a $5800 surgery with our Saint Bernard who thought it was a great idea to eat a pair of socks so I completely understand what you are going through. Best of luck to your precious car and most importantly don‚Äôt judge yourself for this! Animals will get into anything at a young age.
Oh, Lou. Chipped in a few bucks, hope he‚Äôs better and doesn‚Äôt eat any more screws
Donated, I saw this posted through my friend‚Äôs social yesterday. Best of luck to Lou (and you)!
hey guys! monday morning update! vet just called, Lou still hasn‚Äôt eaten and she‚Äôs acting strange. She said she also has a bit of a fever. So, game plan is that she‚Äôll be staying there for most of today so that they can really keep an eye on her. Pretty stressed out because yesterday it seemed like she was doing so well :(
What a cutie! I hope he feels better soon!
OP, what is the name of the vet clinic and what will the bill be?
Just pitched in a few bucks for Lou.   My cat ate a sewing needle a few years back; I remember the pain of having to absorb the cost... and I had a good paying job.  Hope you get enough to cover the bill.
My kitty had emergency surgery at that same vet 8 or so years ago. Hope she feels better soon!!
CareCredit and ScratchPay are good payment options. Were radiographs done to see the screw? Isshe showing any gastrointestinal symptoms?
Helped a bit! Good luck to you and your kitty.
Donated! Wishing Lou a speedy recovery!
Anyone who replies on this comment with their donation will be matched up to 250$.
Just checked and it looks like it‚Äôs now fully funded. So glad to see this! Hope Lou is doing well. ‚ù§Ô∏è
I‚Äôm able to pay in installments only because I used to work at this vet!  :)
cats are wild!!!!! thank you so much for your help!!
posted in comments :) thank you!
thank you so so so much!!!
it looks like r/cats doesn‚Äôt allow fundraising but i‚Äôll try to check out other subreddits!!
It was a good decision.  If results aren‚Äôt favorable, you don‚Äôt want your baby to suffer.  I chose to give my seven year old cat a mastectomy for an aggressive cancer in hopes of buying time.  Turns out it didn‚Äôt give her much more time and she spent part of that time just recovering from invasive surgery.  Your situation may have been different, but pet surgeries are hard decisions to make.
I‚Äôm so sorry that happened to you :(
thank you so so much!!!!!!!!
it‚Äôs so scary! thank you so much!!!!!!
oh i‚Äôm so sorry :( after all this is over, you‚Äôre so so welcome to come and cuddle Lou!!!!!
posted in comments!!
oh no!!!!! she‚Äôs never tried eating anything that wasn‚Äôt food so this was REALLY surprising and unexpected
for real üò≠üò≠
thank you so much!!
the vet says she seems much happier today!!
Upvoting, I'll be happy to donate with just a bit more information!  &#x200B;  Edit: Just found the answer in another comment, they said Carefirst Animal Hospital on Oberlin. Closed today for Easter, obviously, but open tomorrow.  &#x200B;  Double Update: They are actually open, and confirmed that there is a cat there in post-surgery that ate a screw! That's enough for me, I sent $10.
i‚Äôll dm you! i don‚Äôt wanna put allll my info out there hehe ~~
oh my god that had to be so scary i‚Äôm so sorry!
they‚Äôre so good but they‚Äôre so expensive aaaah! hope to have her back in my arms by tomorrow morning
So I‚Äôm going to be able to pay in installments because I used to work at the vet where I took her!! My friend was watching her for me because I‚Äôve been staying at my parents house to take care of them during all of this, and she told me like two full days later that she wasn‚Äôt eating and that she was puking constantly. The vet called this morning and said that Lou is doing really well this morning :)
thank you so much!!!!!
I'm not sure if you can fundraise there but this picture would go over well on r/curledfeetsies. She's a beautiful cat!
I‚Äôm sorry :( It sounds like she had a great home and lots of love.
Ok cool.   My 11 month old boy loves eating plastic and foam from my exercise mat, so I feel for you. I‚Äôve had this scare more than once, luckily he‚Äôs vomited out all the foam until I finally learned to keep it out of reach. It‚Äôs wild that cats eat this stuff!  Hope kitty recovers quickly.
Oh good! That's awesome!
Were you able to pay on Lou‚Äôs tab directly over the phone?
We were able to catch it before it got as far along as Lou‚Äôs bolt. We made it to an emergency vet at about midnight. They had him scoped and the needle out by 4 am. If it had been any longer we would have been headed down the same, not expensive, road as Lou.   Thanks for the thoughts. Again, good luck to Lou.
They are wonderful, glad to hear that Lou is getting the very best of care!
Perfect! Ask for routine radiographs to track the progress along the GI tract. If it makes it to the large intestine, then it will pass on its own!!
she‚Äôs at the vet until monday morning earliest :( she‚Äôs never tried eating anything that wasn‚Äôt food and honestly we don‚Äôt even know how she managed to fit the screw in her throat
They said I could, but recommended calling back Monday to do so because they were under some time constraints today.
oh no she already had surgery to get it cut out. it had only just passed the stomach, and wasn‚Äôt even close to the colon :(
I would be happy to call the vet and contribute directly, which vet?
Oh okay! Well I am very happy to hear she is recovering well, and I am happy your former workplace is willing to do payment plans with you!
if you‚Äôd like!!! it‚Äôs Carefirst animal hospital at oberlin!! they‚Äôre closed today to the public but I can send you information tomorrow if you‚Äôre really sure!!!
I‚Äôm sure. I‚Äôm lucky enough to have a job, for now, and having had $3k emergency cat surgery bills, I know the pain and panic.

Protestors call for North Carolina businesses to reopen amid COVID-19 pandemic

Stopped the video to read one of the protestors' signs, really helps you understand why they think it's okay to reopen. At least one of the protestors believes:  * The tests are flawed (they don't detail how, I assume they think the tests are presenting lots of false positives) * The numbers of confirmed cases and deaths are "overinflated" * There's "no substantial evidence of spreading in NC" * Not only are there medicines readily available and being used to treat the virus, there's medicine that ***prevents*** the virus from manifesting  So by that logic, the situation is totally overblown, and even if it really is as serious as everyone else is saying, there's no real danger because we already have a cure. So if there's no real danger, the shutdown is pointless and needs to be lifted.  DISCLAIMER JUST IN CASE: I don't agree with any of the points above, I'm just presenting these nutjobs' viewpoint as I understand it.  EDIT: Grammar fix, added context to first point
Let those people go first. Let ALL of them fill the jobs that essential employees are doing, RIGHT NOW. Let them come face to face with the potential to be infected with a deadly virus, through something as simple as a touch. We‚Äôll see how brave they are, then.
I get what you are trying, but it isn‚Äôt that easy to just *reopen*. A lot of other people will die if we just reopen all Willy nilly. Not like these people care about anything but themselves anyway.
This is a Trump rally under the disguise of opening up small businesses. watch the video look at the photos and there's people with Don't Tread On Me flags, people dressed in american flag clothing and people that think the numbers are overinflated. Look even closer and I bet there's people with blue lives matter stickers and punisher skull icons too. It's an embarrassing look for North Carolina when people like this show up not social distancing, not wearing masks and looking like uneducated idiots.
Does my up vote go to you for reporting or my down vote go to them?    I'm so conflicted.
Anyone thinking of the people on the front lines would stay home. Police, EMS, nurses and doctors are at risk of becoming infected.  PPE is being rationed.  These same people will get sick and someone will have to care for them.
Fucking idiots.
The demonstrations should be more directed to why the different levels of government didn't act sooner to try and avoid a necessary sudden reaction. Or why providing aid is still in process and not already out there weeks ago. The efforts are misguided, especially since they're wanting to undo what's been keeping numbers below the projections. It's the same mentality as the ones who have said we should have let the virus run its course - people like that don't understand what society is for and they certainly think that they are immune to the effects.
Here is a t-shirt designed by the group responsible for this:  https://teespring.com/mmamv-be-informed?tsmac=store&tsmic=custom-designs-by-jmek&pid=2&cid=2397  That URL on the shirt leads to a batshit crazy anti-vax site with patriotic visuals. For those unaware, this is straight out of the playbook of [Russian trolls](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/anti-vax-movement-russian-trolls-fueled-anti-vaccination-debate-in-us-by-spreading-misinformation-twitter-study/) to disrupt and cause chaos in American society.   So good job participating in a Russian psy op to dismantle our nation, you stupid fucks.
People in this area are straight up daft, like holy shit. I can't think of anything more idiotic than gathering in a group during a global pandemic that has infected [nearly 2 million](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/?) to tell the government to stop doing what they're doing to save people just like them. It's like the Raleigh Community Information group in the flesh, just absolutely bonkers stupid.
I don't really blame these people. We are all scared about the future plus a lack of strong and smart leadership in this country makes it worse.
Protesting at this time?!? Crazy but at least they are following the group rules. Hurts because in a way I kind of agree with them.
wow, it's so nice to see so many of you giving a fuck about how poverty kills these days. where have y'all been?
I didn't know this was happening until I saw it on Twitter. Looks like they had to arrest people for not leaving. [https://twitter.com/KaplanABC11/status/1250088631391465478](https://twitter.com/KaplanABC11/status/1250088631391465478)
i know 2 people who have committed suicide due to the isolation and money issues over losing jobs and here are a bunch of nosey nancies being keyboard warriors on the reddit.  applaud each of you being advocates for this shit show.
Smells like [astroturf](https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/Astroturf)
It would be a mistake to reopen now but at least fucking clean up the unemployment thing and let people know they are getting something. Instead of the website down all day and a phone line that goes nowhere. then you can just sit on pending for who knows how long. people would be less panicy if they knew something...  that said every time idiots go out and expose more people by gathering they are just making it worse and making this take longer potentially.....
I looked  at the fb page of the group that put the protest together (prolly with the help of russia, this stinks of being pit american against american no matter what russian tactic) and picked a random admin.  Would it shock you if i said she was raising funds for an anti vaccine group a year ago?
So they watch Fox News based on that evidence.
They probably wouldn't care because they don't believe the Corona virus is a real threat.
I'm one of the essential employees, and it's a relief sometimes now when I get to work in the kitchen away from people other than staff, than constantly be up at the register. So many people are doing the "right things" the wrong way (wearing one glove but then touching their face after touching an object with both hands, pulling down masks to talk to me even when I can hear them fine) and it scares me thinking that people are capable of being asymptomatic and still being a carrier. I wouldn't mind these idiot's being the ones in my shoes.
I would bet all of them are small bussiness owners and prolly have not actully worked for a boss other than themselfs recenty. They have no idea how to function if they have to be accountable to a boss. They cant hack it thats why they open thier own place then bitch and moan they are going broke as they deposit that check they got from the feds and file for the grants they are getting to stay afloat.
Yep.  they only want things open because they are loosing money.  They figure few dead here and there is ok as long as they can make money. I dont wish these folks have close family or freinds die but on the other hand maybe if a few of them got to watch a loved one die (over vid chat on a phone because they cant actully visit them in the hospital)  from it they might be less excited to get things open again.
Yep. I watched a few minutes of the live stream.  It is exactly the type of protestors I expected.  This isn‚Äôt about the virus.  It‚Äôs about politics.  That‚Äôs the message they are trying to send.
Yeah, you should take a look at the admin and members section of the Facebook page. It's...painful.
I disagree with what they are doing but why do you have to make this a splitting issue between Democrat/Republicans. You also assumed that they are Trump supporters because they wear Don't Tread On Me flags and American clothing? I'm a liberal who owns all of those articles of clothing.  It's people that you that put themselves on false pedestals that inevitably create a greater divide between people.  &#x200B;  \*\*EDIT: I Watched the videos on the bottom not the one on top.  You are right, I am wrong.  Sorry for coming off as brazen.
The majority of the protesters were staying in/by their cars and maintaining social distancing.
The former. Upvoting isn't supposed to be an agree/disagree button even if it's used that way. It's supposed to represent how meaningful that person's input was to the conversation.
r/CovIdiots
I mean as we see with Qanon, not everything is Russia. Russian trolls don‚Äôt hold a candle to some of the absolute batshit things Americans will believe
It's not just this area. These people are everywhere.
I don‚Äôt feel bad for people who openly deny science and medical experts and think everything is some major conspiracy.
Do I think it's ill-advised to reopen right now?   Yes.    Is social distancing flatting the curve and saving lives?   Yes.  Do I agree with the infringement on people's first amendment rights or the ability to protest?   No.    I support others and their right to protest regardless of how I feel about their cause because I believe it's important and the foundation of our country.  If we grant the government the awesome power to take away people's ability to make a living or to do basic daily functions I don't think its too far of an overreach to allow those people to protest even if some of us think it's misguided.
> It's hard to feel compassion when they are willing to expose themselves and others to disease  Well, I'm sure you'd feel differently if your 50yr old family owned small business was about to go under or you don't have any money for your mortgage or rent payment or enough to buy groceries for your family.  My friend with kids has been unemployed for almost a month and still hasn't gotten an unemployment check.  It's a "trolley problem" where if you do nothing, a bunch of people die. But if you keep everything closed, a bunch of people end up in poverty.
>It's hard to feel compassion when they are willing to expose themselves and others to disease.  I don't know, I feel as negatively towards them for doing this as I do against people getting take-out at Mexican restaurants.  There is zero reason to get take out other than "just wanting to".  However, people risk themselves and others "during a pandemic" to do so.   Could the same argument be made there?  And if not, why?  At the same time, these people look eye-rollingly simple and I kind of feel sorry for people like them.  But I also don't know of an argument why they're doing much more "bad" than the tens of thousands of people in the state who are routinely making unnecessary trips to restaurants, Home Depot, etc.
She's got a Facebook "like" for the American's for Prosperity page, so this is home grown Koch brother's brand crazy.
So Russians organized a protest in Raleigh, NC about the mandatory closing of small businesses??  üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ. ü§° üåé
Did you really have to bring anti-russian xenophobia into this when good old fashioned american dumbassery is the simpler explanation?
Na this is OAN level ignorance.
These are Trumpers no question.
This is a weird criticism of small business
As a small business owner, i‚Äôd sure like some floaty checks. Sba just announced their support is only for bisinesses who have multiple employees or need $1m minimim loans.
Anti-Vaccer, anti-vaccer, anti-vaccer AND anti-5g conspiracy theories...      They're not sending their best. Some of them are good people, I assume...
Gonna go down that rabbit hole out of curiosity now.
Several are wearing trump shirts, lots of the signs are blaming the fake news media and a few even call it a hoax.  I don‚Äôt know how it could be anymore trump without them painting themselves Orange, putting on a suit and shouting that windmills cause cancer.
Did you watch the footage or read their posters? It‚Äôs the Fox News crowd which is inherently political. You‚Äôre also telling me you have a flag that‚Äôs typically associated with the far right just for fun? Riiiight.
Yep. Those aren‚Äôt trump supporter symbols. That‚Äôs more just general patriotic stuff. If the poster has a problem with a portion of the country actually liking their country then that‚Äôs just idiotic.
ya, I was just trying to be sarcastic because I'm not very witty.
Is it really peaceful when it puts people‚Äôs lives at risk? Just a thought.
Who's saying you can't protest? The only thing you can't do is gather in groups. Go protest online from your home, adjust just like everyone else is.
Then they should be advocating for stronger social welfare during this pandemic as well as in the future. I happily support them protesting this to save themselves and help bridge this gap. However, opening things back up is not the solution.  I agree with /u/-PM_YOUR_BACON , they're advocating for spreading the virus. Governor Cooper is listening to experts and scientists.
>But if you keep everything closed, a bunch of people end up in poverty.    And die as a result.
For someone who can easily work from home and that has a family or loved ones at home that they get along with (or are already given to being socially withdrawn), it's easy to shrug and think that this whole stay-at-home situation is no big deal. But for people that are winding up isolated, out of work, and being called "idiots" because they don't want to be under house arrest indefinitely, it's not hard to imagine that there's going to be a spike in the suicide rate soon.  And since suicide *already* kills more people in NC than coronavirus has (by a factor of 3 at least over the same time period), if your concern is saving lives then it's not unreasonable to wonder if the effort spent on a lockdown isn't misplaced.
Yes, this is capitalism!
If you‚Äôve owned a small business for 50 years and can‚Äôt float for a few months either your business or lifestyle is unsustainable. Some people aren‚Äôt meant to be self employed.
> or you don't have any money for your mortgage or rent payment or enough to buy groceries for your family.  Thats what the 1200 dollar check each peerson (2400 for a couple, 500 for each kid) is for.   There is loan/grant program for them to keep paying employees even if they are not working and the business is shut down right now.  I bet many folks are getting paid, not working for it and get a nice check from the govt.
if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck....its prolly a duck
Its fact that they used socail media to sow discord on a varity of subjects. they would set up groups on both sides of a topic and then feed the hate and set up rallies just like this one to create division.    I am not making it up.   "The IRA later used social media accounts and interest groups to sow discord in the U.S. political system through what it termed "information warfare." The campaign evolved from a generalized program designed in 2014 and 2015 to undermine the U.S . electoral system, to a targeted operation that by early 2016 favored candidate Trump and disparaged candidate Clinton. The IRA' s operation also included the purchase of political advertisements on social media in the names of U.S. persons and entities, as well as the staging of political rallies inside the United States. To organize those rallies, IRA employees posed as U.S. grassroots entities and persons and made contact with Trump supporters and Trump Campaign officials in the United States. The investigation did not identify evidence that any U.S. persons conspired or coordinated with the IRA. Section II of this report details the Office's investigation of the Russian social media campaign. "  can you guesse where i pulled that quote from?    "as well as the staging of political rallies inside the United States. To organize those rallies, IRA employees posed as U.S. grassroots entities and persons and made contact with Trump supporters and Trump Campaign officials in the United States. The investigation did not identify evidence that any U.S. persons conspired or coordinated with the IRA. Section II of this report details the Office's investigation of the Russian social media campaign. "   well gee whiz that sounds a lot like how this "protest" came to be doesnt it?
and they are being maniplulated.  It is not a coincidence it was orginized by new fb group. Its the same tactic we know the russians have done in the past and will keep doing.  Idiots keep falling for the propoghanda.
Speaking as someone who grew up in a family business, it is absolutely true though.
It true for many small business owners.
lol I was thinking the same thing.
hmmm.  "The Paycheck Protection Program This section creates the PPP, the Paycheck Protection Program, one of the most high profile parts of the law. It establishes what is called a 7(a) loan, a lending program administered by the Small Business Administration (the SBA).  Under the PPP any small business that has been in operation since February 15 can get a low-interest, short-term loan to cover losses caused by the quarantines and the coronavirus itself. Freelancers, contractors and other self-employed individuals can apply for these loans as well, making them de-facto small businesses for the purpose of this crisis. Borrowers can use this money to cover payroll and benefit costs, as well as certain overhead such as rent, mortgages, utilities, and interest on debt taken out before February 15, 2020.  The maximum amount of a PPP loan is based on a business‚Äô payroll adjusted upward to cover overhead as well. A business can borrow up to eight weeks‚Äô worth of costs, measured from when it applies for the loan. Anyone who spends at least 75% of the money on pay and benefits will have the loan entirely forgiven, effectively turning it into a grant. Businesses which reduce their payroll (either by laying people off or cutting pay) will also have to repay more of the loan.  The PPP is arguably the most significant employment stabilization aspect of the CARES Act. It provides free money for businesses to pay employees. By tying loan forgiveness to staffing numbers this provision tries to convince small businesses to keep their employees on, and to rehire those laid off during the early weeks of the crisis. The program has been very slow to roll out, however. The private banks which are supposed to dispense these loans have been reluctant to freely lend, in part because the Treasury has only recently confirmed that the government, not the lenders, will assume all risks of nonpayment."  https://www.thestreet.com/politics/what-is-in-the-cares-act  https://www.sba.gov/funding-programs/loans/coronavirus-relief-options
I did not watch the video on top because of the ad, but damn.  You are right, welp.  Lets hope they only mingle with other idiots and leave the ones with senses alone.
To be fair, they stole that flag for their use. That happens a lot in history, symbols and such that once had one meaning being changed by the next user.
I was there, I don't watch Fox News.
What about those that stayed in their cars and honked their horns?  They aren‚Äôt exposing anyone.    Protests aren‚Äôt supposed to be palatable and easy and are seldom approved or appreciated.  I‚Äôm not saying that the people out there are going to be in any history books, but in a system of living law based on precedent I don‚Äôt fault folk for wanting to stop what they see as over reach or abuse of their rights, even I don‚Äôt see it like that.
Yes, because protesting *online* has such a demonstrated track record of affecting meaningful change.   "Why are these people doing the thing that sometimes works when they could just stay home and do the thing that never works?"
I‚Äôm sure they are doing that, and calling and writing. And they feel their voices are being marginalized or ignored. I‚Äôm not to say weather or not they are correct.   ‚ÄúA riot is the language of the unheard‚Äù.    These are desperate and frustrated people and on an anecdotal level this issue in my social sphere is less politically polarizing and more class based.  The people who are hit hardest or are feeling the most squeezed are looking at the risk calculations differently.   Some of these disenfranchised people are probably brought here by bad faith actors, or political idealogues. (And in an effort of disclosure I‚Äôll admit some might consider me one too). But that doesn‚Äôt make their views or opinions less valid than others or that they don‚Äôt retain their fundamental right to protest and beseech the people who are holding basically deific control over if they‚Äôre allowed to have money/ resources or not.     Trust in the government is great and a wonderful thing  but not everyone has that. So their concerns amplify when their control is removed and their only hope is a slow moving entity that they view as indifferent or hapless.
There's something about American culture where we just hate the idea of being paid for not working. On an emotional level, people want the personal satisfaction of working for a living.  It's an admirable quality in theory, though I suppose the hole in that mindset is on full display here. My point being, it's more complicated than that.
>You can't have a business when everyone is dead.  What?  This is not the Spanish Flu.  You do not have to worry about that.
> You can't have a business when everyone is dead  This is absurd on the face of it. Are you just being dramatic, or are you actually laboring under the misapprehension that this virus represents and existential threat to humanity?
> You can't have a business when everyone is dead.  But the thing is that not everyone will die from this. People are acting like 50% of the population will drop dead, but that just isn't true. At first, this virus appeared super deadly, but now that more time has passed, it seems to be overblown and the real mortality rates for people 50 or under are below 1%.  If you are under age 50 and don't have any major health problems, your chances of dying in a car accident are significantly higher.
Exactly. This is what people don‚Äôt get. Roughly 5% of US deaths are attributable to the effects of poverty. At some point the cure does become worse than the disease when you kill off small businesses and unemployment jumps to crazy levels. Gonna have to gradually start reopening soon or else more total people will die as a a result AND the economic recovery  time will be drastically longer.   Honestly it‚Äôs a balance that it seems like NC is doing a decent job of so far. We‚Äôre pretty much all going to get it at some point. Need a steady trickle of cases without overwhelming the hospitals to build herd immunity.
I don‚Äôt know about nc, bit pretty sure covid19 is third largest cause of death in the us right now.
Few small businesses have sufficient margins to plan for a pandemic.
> If you‚Äôve owned a small business for 50 years and can‚Äôt float for a few months either your business or lifestyle is unsustainable.  There‚Äôs a difference between being able to handle slow business and an immediate halt of _all_ business for an indeterminate amount of time.  We‚Äôre talking 18+ months until a vaccine is ready.  At some point you‚Äôre gonna have to be OK with the economy re-opening, because it sure as hell can‚Äôt survive being shut down until the vaccine arrives.
Should have bought more bootstraps! Never know when an act of god might strike and result in the government ordering you to shut down and telling you to go fuck yourself when you find yourself without revenue through no fault of your own!
Doesn‚Äôt really help too much if your expenses are more than $1200. And considering it‚Äôs a one time payment, it‚Äôs like trying to put out a forest fire with a bucket of water.
For the record, there is supposed to be help coming from the Small Business Administration as well, but it's currently a shitshow- neither they nor the banks are able to manage the volume of work they're getting, and some of the bigger banks are seemingly trying to work against business owners instead of with them.
Put down the bong please.
It‚Äôs definitely true but it‚Äôs not a bad thing that there are people like that. Something like 85% of the economy is small businesses. Without people driven to be their own boss the economy collapses.
It loans you up to two months income. It‚Äôs not clear whether forgiveness applies to self-employed people.
I liked the Punisher from Marvel comics when he‚Äôd show up and help Daredevil but that Iconography has been coopted for the worse now.
Not sheltering in place?
I agree with that. Protest all you want for whatever you want. Just don‚Äôt break laws and put other people‚Äôs lives at risk while doing so.
Well, it's not ideal, but when there's a stay at home order for the safety of the state, then that's your best option.
This is pointless.  There clearly is a plurality of people on Reddit that have given in to fear and forgotten what freedom is really worth.  If I was a conspiracy theorist I would say V for Vendetta was removed by Netflix recently for a reason.

You either a) open too early (before we have testing and enough ICU capacity) and more people die, causing the economy to crumble or b) open after we have everything in place, which will take longer and likely have the economy in a worse starting point than when opening in option a, but less people overall die and the economy bounces back quicker.  There's really no debate here. It sucks for people right now, I get it, but you have to take a big picture view. The only reason people are saying the solution is worse than the disease is because social distancing is keeping the disease from having an even more devastating impact.
Not even close. Cancer and heart disease each kill an order of magnitude more people over a comparable time period. It's perhaps the third largest *communicable disease* cause of death.  If you're sufficiently worried about this virus to think that shutting down society is a reasonable response, but you're still eating fried-anything, you aren't assessing risk rationally.
Apparently even large corporations don‚Äôt have sufficient margins to plan for a pandemic.
If your margins aren‚Äôt enough for you to plan for an emergency you shouldn‚Äôt be self employed.
Feel free to send me your check if think its pointless or not helpful. I will do my part and spend it in the local economy. Got a guy doing my deck right now (went ahead with the work because of that check showing up) and ill be happy to walk down the block and hire the dude mulching my nieghbors landscaping to do mine later this week.
They just backpedaled the eidl grants, too. Now only for shops with employees.
I think the email I just got said $1000 per employee or some BS like that.
I was exercising >!my rights!<
1-3% is not realistic though.  3 out of 10,000 (or 0.003% of the population) is the total Italy death toll as of today, and it will likely stay within that range for the time being.  The, maybe it will increase but likely not more than twice of what it is today, to maybe 6-8 out of 10,000.  I'm not saying that is the COVID-19 death rate, mind you.  But I am saying that is a death rate of a country that did not have time to be prepared, and one that was fairly ravaged by it.  And \~8 out of 10,000, while huge on a country-level scale, is not something that by itself would have a huge effect on a country.  Now, that death toll combined with everything else (which is/was necessary) will absolutely have an impact.    But yeah, keeping things in perspective, the vast, vast majority of people will not be dead (going back to your original quote), no matter what they choose to do.
> With your numbers of even 1%, you are just 'fine' with 1.47 million under the age of 50 people in the US dying?  No, I'm not fine with it. But I'm also not fine with millions of people being unemployed, losing their health coverage for their entire family, and losing their homes and businesses.  And how do you know that more people won't die from economic distress than from the virus?  The stay at home orders are in place so the hospitals don't get overwhelmed. I'd say they are doing a good job at that, but eventually people have to get back to work because each day that passes, more and more people lose their jobs and can't afford to pay their bills.
I think party of the frustration is the stark realization that the mitigation plans for the economic fallout are minimal and mostly on the fly.    I‚Äôm pro social distancing, but I get people who are afraid that the government won‚Äôt be able to help them after and romanticize the idea of just taking the risk of catching it and hoping their fine rather than being relegated to a financial abyss.    The reason isn‚Äôt just because the number reductions from the successful initiatives, it‚Äôs also people desire for self determination and control, however misguided it might be.
The economy goes up much slower than it goes down. There is no ‚Äúbounce back quicker‚Äù. It typically rises at about the same rate when it‚Äôs going up. The longer it‚Äôs in free fall the longer it takes to dig out.   It‚Äôs also not necessarily true that less overall people will die. Again, the negative externalities of poverty could most definitely kill more people long run off we aren‚Äôt careful. What we are in effect doing is moving the health risks posed disproportionately to older people and putting the economic and in turn health impact on the young and minorities.   I‚Äôm definitely not saying open everything up now but someone somewhere better be weighing all this out and taking everything into account. We can‚Äôt just knee jerk try to prevent ALL deaths now at all costs without taking into account the impact of a prolonged economic downturn on people‚Äôs health as well.   TLDR - broke people will eat like shit, have more stress and less access to healthcare. They could die in greater numbers longer run if things are closed too long. This shifts the deaths from old to young.
Hmm, well, according to [science](https://www.livescience.com/coronavirus-leading-cause-of-death.html), covid19 is now the number one cause of death in the us.
/r/imgratefulyourenotincharge
Why do you think you ought to be the arbiter of something like that?
Sure, it helps to buy groceries and maybe pay a bill, but if someone has a mortgage and car payments to make then I fail to see how $1200 will help them.  And mind you, this is a one time payment that some people won't get until May or June.
Do you think that people will just return to shopping and traveling and entertainment the day after the stay at home orders are over?  There is going to be a greater economic impact than just the stay at home order.
A country that continues to have people dying from Covid 19 and stresses the healthcare infrastructure will rebound slower than a country that has appropriate testing measures in place and reopens after they have ensured our hospital ICU capacity is suitable. That's not really debatable.  Your thoughts on the shift of the burden do seem the have merit, but I will defer to the experts on this. And at this time, the experts still seem to think we need to keep our current measures in place.
that was for each day in the past few weeks  heart disease is going to kill upwards of 700,000 Americans this year
Im grateful I‚Äôm self employed and responsible with my money.
Because this is the American standard for everything.  There is virtually no safety net for human beings. Particularly here in NC. Why a business would be put above human beings is beyond me.
its 2400 for a couple. that should cover a 1200 mortage ( a 250k house comes out to be roughly 1200 a month over a 30 year loan) and leave some for food (lets say 500 a month at most if cooking at home) and that leaves 700 dollars for a car, electric, water, internet.   A single is gonna have it a bit tougher but odds are thier mortage or rent is not as high.  If someone has a 1200 or 1500 doallr rent or mortage payment as a single and mising two or three paychecks puts them underwater its prolly clear they were over extended to begin with. They should have saved up a bit just in case something bad happens. Might be time for them ask mom and dad if they are willing to rent the childhood bedroom back out to them cheap.    Anyone can go here https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/non-filers-enter-payment-info-here and make sure thier bank info is in the system so they dont have to wait til may or june.
They clearly want to right now, so yes?
And a country with fewer businesses to come back to rebounds the slowest.   It‚Äôs an interesting debate since we will get to see all the different options play out in each state. I want NC to wait and see what happens in somewhere like Texas since it doesn‚Äôt seem like they won‚Äôt stay closed long at all. We will hopefully fall somewhere in the middle (we are a purple state after all). Don‚Äôt open too soon or too late.
How does that affect the broader point that extreme measures are necessary to keep people alive during a pandemic?
> mising two or three paychecks puts them underwater its prolly clear they were over extended to begin with  Most Americans live paycheck to paycheck and cannot afford to be unemployed for even a month. Those who can afford it are in the minority.
There it is.  The old "just stop being so poor" argument.
Here is a good summary of the problem with your thinking https://mobile.twitter.com/DKThomp/status/1250471852633448448
Not at all what i am saying. a 1200 dollar mortage is 250k house.  that aint poor. its just below median home price in the state of nc.   I am saying they should have stopped living above thier means a long time ago and put some money in savings.  Find a house that only cost you 800 a month (thats about a 175k house) and save the 400 a month. In one year they save 4800.  That 4800 would pay the mortage on that 175k house for 6 months.   do it for 5 years and its 24k saved.  Its not about stopping being poor. itss about stop being stupid with money and assuming its just gonna keep coming in all the time.     At some point folks have to man up and own what they have done and deal with it.    Yes there are 175k dollar houses around.  No they aint perfect or in the best locations all the time but it beats ending up living in a van down by the river when shit goes south.  I dont just talk the talk. I did it. I managed to retire at 48 and never made more than 80k a year. I prolly avged 50k over 20years. I did it by living cheap and lower than my means.  Now i sit in my paid for 300k+ house in a nice hood and smoke weed whenever i feel like it (every damn day!)   it was more than worth all the brown bag lunches and years of driving beater cars while my buddies were taking cruises, going to vegas, eating out,  driving newer cars and living in nicer, bigger houses. Most of them still slave away in thier mid 50s . They cant wrap thier head around how i did it. Uhhh i saved like a madman for 30 years, thats how.
I guess for a good summary of the problem with your thinking, read above, or look at all the complaining posts in this subreddit, or even just look outside.
> its just below median home price in the state of nc  Well, there are 49 other states in the US, many with much higher costs of living.  My friend was an executive manager at a hotel in Chicago making $120K before the hotel closed and now everyone is out of a job until July, probably even longer because I don't see the tourism or conference industry returning to normal this year. Fortunately he has some money saved up, but that money was supposed to be for a downpayment on a home.  How is $1200 supposed to help him when his rent payment is $1500/mo?  My friend is relatively early in his career, so he hasn't had 30+ years like you to save for a rainy day.
Good for you?  This is all just so woefully out of touch it‚Äôs not even worth getting into. In summary: not everyone is fortunate enough to be in a position to purchase a home, any home, in the best of times, and while the stimulus check certainly helps, it doesn‚Äôt fix everything.
with the 1200 and 300 dollars from whatever mcjob he picks up and he is good to go.

Where can people get tested for COVID-19 in Raleigh?
There was a post 32 days ago on this sub which pretty much said it was impossible. We all know a lot has changed in a months time so I was curious to see if more options have came available. thanksEdit: I called the number that u/LukeVenable suggested and was able to get a test the next day (today 4/16/2020). Lots of phone calls required (admin, triage, nurse, doctor, scheduler) but they all happen within an hour.
Primary care provider here. This is just my personal experience, so take it for what it's worth.   We were initially performing tests at our clinic through labcorp, but we are no longer doing any tests because the turnaround time for results became so ridiculous (over 10 days in most cases). When we have patients with symptoms suggestive of COVID, we are now directing them to the UNC testing centers as they typically get results within 24 hours (at least at the sites that use the UNC test). The help line for this is  1-888-850-2684. If you call that number, they'll ask you some screening questions and if you meet criteria they'll direct you to one of the testing centers. Hope this helps
How the hell are we four months into this, in one of the wealthiest nations on earth, and we still can‚Äôt get access to quick, broadly available testing? This is an unmitigated disaster.
I just hear a lot of people are getting slapped with ‚Äúpresumed positive‚Äù but still can‚Äôt be tested unless they are in bad shape
You can get tested at an RDC (Respiratory Diagnostic Center), but you have to be referred by a doctor to get an appointment at one.  They will take vitals, but unless you have a fever or are hypoxic, you aren't likely to be tested, even with other symptoms.  This was my personal experience, and likely not all encompassing.
Thank you so much. I think this answer's the question for others curious.
10 days? See if those numbers have gotten better. Worst I‚Äôve seen was 5 now it‚Äôs about 3 from Labcorp as long as you got swabs to test people.
Does that include UNC Rex?  TY
Because our government is much weaker than the pretend they are and they have absolutely no idea what they are doing.
I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs plenty more the NC government could‚Äôve done, but I place most of the onus on our federal government. Not only did it downplay the virus, it dismantled the task force that looks for shit like this and comes up with a plan. Then once it couldn‚Äôt ignore the obvious, it dragged its feet on a stimulus bill that won‚Äôt give people nearly enough money to weather this (never mind what a fuster cluck it is to get that money). But not before it gave several trillion dollars to Wall Street and big corporations first. It also decided that it‚Äôs not interested in providing any kind of help or unified coordination, resulting in every state entering into bidding wars with each other, causing the price of life-saving supplies to skyrocket. Supplies that we didn‚Äôt have a replenished national stockpile for because the federal government thought ‚Äúmeh‚Äù. And now that very same NATIONAL stockpile (i.e. you and I paid for it with our taxes) belongs to the federal government alone and not the states who desperately need it. Then as to rub salt in this already gaping chest wound, the federal government decides it‚Äôs going to not only bid on supplies (yes, the feds are directly competing with the states for supplies), it also in some cases is seizing supplies that states already paid for or got donated to them.  This is why our country currently has the most confirmed cases per capita in the world. This is why millions of Americans are impoverished and suffering right now. This is why it will in all likelihood take far longer and cost way more money to crawl out of this wreck.
That's exactly what happened to me.
Yup
This is secondhand so take it for what it's worth, but the source is fairly trustworthy (sister is an ICU doc at UNC). She told me last week when my SO was showing symptoms that they would not test her unless she was in serious enough condition to warrant emergency medical attention, and otherwise she would simply be told to stay home.
Were you given any kind of medicine for your symptoms. May you recover swiftly
This worked. I got a test today.
Oh I'm done now. This was over two weeks ago, but thank you!
My aunt and uncle had it (they live in Maryland) and the doctor told them not to come in, even when my aunt had 104F fever for four nights, even when my aunt passed out two different times and fell down some stairs. They also have a 29 year old autistic son (who has mentality of a 5year old), so things were very scary for a bit because of course, if they both had to go to the hospital one of us would have had to go get their son/my cousin. Thankfully after almost four weeks of sickness they are finally on the mend.  To add on, they‚Äôre mid 60s and neither are overweight, no immune issues or anything like that.

Proud of NC Covid 19 as I‚Äôm visiting Florida

I don't have anything to add about those lunatics in Florida, but best wishes for your mother's recovery from her surgery and complications. Hope it's as painless and speedy as possible!
As someone who lives in Orlando, FL -- I can say that I wish our governor wasn't the most stupid governor in the US.  I wish our beaches were closed.  I wish people wore masks (I do).  I wish for a lot.  This is why voting is important no matter where you are.    The restrictions for localities first came from Mayors and other local elected officials.  Not from state officials.
FYI, I realize it was just a joke about bathing in hand sanitizer, but just anyone isn‚Äôt aware, you‚Äôre actually doing a much better job of killing/getting rid of coronavirus (and any other pathogen) by bathing/washing your hands with soap! Alcohol-based (60% or higher) hand sanitizer is great, but is really best used when washing your hands isn‚Äôt an option! I‚Äôm sorry if I was rude and killed the joke, but I just thought that was important to point out! Carry on though!
I hope your mom gets better soon. And your Florida family decides to ride this out with your better precautions.
It‚Äôs interesting because I came down here from New York almost a month ago to temporarily live with friends (I had been quarantining for 14 days before I drove down here in a rental car that I wiped down), and I thought the exact same thing about Raleigh that you think about Florida.   My friends thought I was weird wanting to wear masks while grocery shopping and wiping down the carts/groceries/packages, but I noticed a quick shift in Raleigh 2 weeks ago.
Hand soap is better than hand sanitizer, no need to waste all of it
Culture is top down, so just compare DeSantis to Cooper.  A strong federal response would make a lot of difference, but we know how that's going.    Stay safe.
Yet you are still alive to post.  Thank your lucky stars.
Just wait til tomorrow, we get our big protest then
Wow.
where in raleigh are ppl wearing masks?
wait, you guys are doing all that stuff? lol
With only about 6000 cases in all of North Carolina, there‚Äôs a decent chance you go grocery shopping, walk down the street, go to your office building, and drive to and from Florida and still don‚Äôt come across anybody with this. I‚Äôm not saying this isn‚Äôt a serious disease, but across United States, it‚Äôs not as widespread as we are being made to believe. There actually is a chance that nobody in that neighborhood has this.Sure, take your precautions. But don‚Äôt judge others when the total number of people with this across the entire country would barely fill three or four football stadiums.
Really shows Florida man is real.
It has been the same in nearly all the states, some states just got on board faster
I‚Äôm guessing Disney has a lot to do with that decision.
In his defense, he was wanting the feds to tell him to close the state because he doesn't actually want to run the state.   Between him whining about not getting told by the feds to shut down and his massive bungling of the unemployment website, he clearly doesn't know how to lead.
A month ago, NC hadn't initiated the stay at home protocol state wide, and the CDC hadn't made the general recommendation that everyone wear a mask rather than those who were symptomatic.
Yeah, I dunno what OP is talking about. I go out once a week for groceries/supplies and still over 50% of people in stores are not wearing masks. Many are not consciously abiding by social distancing. Heck, many stores have put literal markings on the floor for lane direction and spacing, and I'd say half the people just ignore them.   Let's not pat ourselves on the back just yet. Florida is a low bar to compare us to. We could be doing better.
There seems to have been a shift in public opinion sometime over the past two weeks. We go grocery shopping about every two weeks (as long as we can hold out with what's in our fridge and pantry, haha). Last time we went out, I would say masks were in the minority (though most people were good about social distancing). This time, not-masks were a clear minority.
Came here to say this. I‚Äôm from PA, but I do freelance work in Raleigh. I‚Äôd traveled down there about three weeks ago and found the response horrible. Our shop was closed, doors locked, lights off, and people STILL kept knocking on the door asking to come in. It was pretty dreadful, and we made it a point to go out and sanitize the doors every time we actually got someone to leave. I was happy to finish that project and get back to PA.
Density is a big negative factor and heat+humidity seems to be a significant mitigating factor. NYC was also (probably) infected way back in February so it was weeks ahead of most of us. So they had to respond more severely and more quickly because things were on the verge of getting totally out of hand.  That's simply not where NC is or ever has been. NC is actually really owning hard in its death count for adopting some restrictions early before cases really started appearing.  The benchmark here is the death rate. This is the best metric we can see to determine how successfully communities are avoiding infections in vulnerable populations. Look at this chart and sort by deaths per capita in the table, and you will find NYC to be a disaster because it started too late, while NC to be doing amazing because it got ahead of it.  https://graphics.reuters.com/HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS-USA/0100B5K8423/index.html  Shaming Florida doesn't do you any good. They have some natural advantages (heat, low density in lots of the state) but some real challenges too (global city in Miami which is certainly an epicenter for contagion). It's also a huge state and what makes sense in Miami may not make sense in rural areas. So it's complicated, but I'd suggest that although they could have done better, their death rate seems to be pretty decent to me, and they may be striking a good compromise given that we (i.e. the US) have no actual plan for doing anything beyond social distancing (i.e. ubiquitous testing), and social distancing alone can at best slow down and drag out the eventual deaths - not prevent them.
I think the exact thing thing of NC and I‚Äôm in NC. I went out twice to ride my bike (cycling along roads) and wanted to cut through Lake Lynn to get to Lynn road. Immediately upon entry is at least 2x families, group of 15 plus, trying to take a mega group picture on the greenway path. I immediately turned around. Neighborhood kids all playing together, families walking together.
I feel the same way. I did our grocery run last week and about half the store wasn't wearing masks still. Got Chipotle takeout, I was the only person going through with a mask on.   Every time we venture out, traffic looks close to normal. Glove use at stores is limited. I can only imagine what else I'd see out there if I actually left the house somewhat regularly
~~Everywhere?~~ Some places. I'm wearing a makeshift mask to shop, and I'd say >80% of people I see at Harris Teeter are wearing something.  Edit:  Killed the 'everywhere' comment because I should have known better than to extrapolate my bubble to other areas of Raleigh.  I'm out in the area near Crabtree, so that's the experience here at least.
Fresh Market in Cameron Village actually requires that patrons wear a mask. I haven't really been around much to see but I'm guessing they aren't the only ones.
The Food lion/Walgreens/ABC store shopping area at rock quarry, think I only saw one person not wearing a mask this week.
There are only 6k that have it in nc that have been tested and we know of out of 80k or so test. 80k test out of 10 mil in the state. its a small sample. We have no idea how how many have or may have had it already and did not even know it.   There have been 750k + positive test in the us.  thats a lot more than 3-4 football stadiums,  thats about the number of folks who go to any nfl football game on any given sunday in the fall.
We have no idea how many cases we have because we don‚Äôt test enough. I have a coworker that almost definitely had covid but they were told by their doctor to stay home and not come in for testing unless they had a lot of trouble breathing. That person and many others like them will never make it into the official count.
You do realize it only took a month for us to go from around 100 cases to 6000, right? As seen in this  [graph](https://i.imgur.com/4s38FHb.jpg).   And that's with a lot of people doing their part to help stop the spread. We should absolutely judge the idiots not taking this seriously because they're making this drag out longer than it has to. Get out of here with that bullshit mentality.
If you are "not saying this isn't a serious disease" then why are you relaying data points that seem to support just that fact?
Florida man will die as Florida man has lived: not givin' a rip
I‚Äôve been worried lately that nc man was vying for the title, bit so grateful the fl man has it locked up at the moment.
For sure they do
I was at Harris Teeter in NW Raleigh yesterday. At least 75% were wearing masks, up from basically 0% two weeks ago. That's a pretty rapid social change.
I know for me personally, I felt more comfortable wearing a mask once the CDC recommended it officially. I had N95 masks already for home improvement stuff, but I felt guilty wearing them since there were shortages for healthcare workers.
Almost everyone is wearing masks in Garner.  The people without them are definitely the minority.  3 weeks ago, it was rare to see someone with a mask.
it was 17 days ago that the recommendation from the CDC changed to everyone should wear masks. prior to that, it was the recommendation that only those who were symptomatic should wear masks (applicable of course to the general public only, not those in health care, care takers, or emergency responders).
Well, I wouldn't *discourage* anyone from shaming Florida for really any reason at all. It is pretty awful.
wow i‚Äôm down here in south east wake and pretty much nobody is wearing them. went fishing at jordan lake i didn‚Äôt see a single mask there either
Are they handing out masks as people enter the store?  There have been times when I was out and I forgot mine at home.  Dumb, I know.
Given the recent Stanford research and the antibody testing in the Netherlands, we're probably looking at 50X-85X the cases we're seeing now. There probably wouldn't be an even distribution given individual state measures, densely populated areas, etc. But we for sure have a lot more than 6000 cases.   In fact, anyone who's going off that number is completely ill informed or a bad faith actor. Likely, both.
I mean, if that sample size bears out, 750k people in this state are positive for COVID-19 and we don't even know it yet.
Many people with same the symptoms as covid-19 do not have it. How do you know your coworker did?
You do realize OP just said he went to another state to visit someone with a compromised immune system. And you‚Äôre ok with that. Get out of here with that bs mentality.
I noticed this and made the same comment yesterday. There‚Äôs a new coffee shop called Brew to Brew at the HT on Creedmoor before you hit 540. I went there for an online order I made and saw almost every person going in HT with a mask on. Something I commented to my wife about since about a week ago I didn‚Äôt see any as I went by.
I too have felt much better about the idea of wearing a mask in public after the CDC recommendation.  I had to leave the house today for the first time in about 2 weeks for a field meeting (I have a Construction-adjacent job).  I show up and there are 4 other people already there standing about 2 feet apart from each other and no masks.  I still got a funny look when I showed up but I am not taking any chances.
That coincides directly with the recommendation from the CDC changing from those who are symptomatic to wear masks to everyone should wear masks. Prior to that, it was reasonable that one wouldn't wear a mask when out.
It must be just a regional thing.  I'm only venturing out to Harris Teeter (and a single trip out to Wegmans because Wegmans), and it was mask heavy.  I can definitely only speak for my small area of NW Raleigh though, and I shouldn't have said everywhere based on that!    Hope you stay safe out there, and catch some fish =)
No, no one has masks to hand out they‚Äôre in short supply. You have to wear your own.
[The Stanford study has a few issues with the way it was conducted.](https://medium.com/@balajis/peer-review-of-covid-19-antibody-seroprevalence-in-santa-clara-county-california-1f6382258c25) Likely the cases are much higher as you've said, but most likely not more than 50x-80x as the study suggests
Because they had the exact symptoms that covid 19 patients have during the time when covid 19 was/is rampant. It‚Äôs not a hard connection to make.
I didn't say anything about OP's behavior. I'm addressing your point that there's "only" 6000 cases. Good job on that strawman, though.
Yeah my plant now provides masks at the door and you‚Äôre required to wear them, which is nice. We‚Äôve reduced staffing to minimal levels - today was my first day on site in over a month.
Exactly. Before that, we were actively told not to.
we have much less density out here. i can understand inside the beltline folks wearing masks tho
I read it. Most people will not and there's no point in muddying the waters. The point is there is no reason to go off official cases given a multitude of reasons.
We've done 85k tests and only have 6000 positives. If it's so easy to make the connection, why have we tested 84,400 people who didnt have it?
We don't have widespread testing. As of right now from the NCDHHS website we have 78,772 completed tests, with 6,493 laboratory confirmed cases. How many of the 72,279 who tested negative had the "exact symptoms that covid 19 patients have during the time when covid 19 was/is rampant"? I suspect more than the 6,493 who tested positive.
OK fair point- I got a little off-topic there.  But how many of those 6000 cases are currently in the hospital? Like 300. In the entire state from Murphy to Manteo.   If we test more, we will probably find more. But how many of those people walking around not even knowing they have it would end up in the hospital? Probably very few, since they already have it and don‚Äôt even know. So how bad is it, if you have it and don‚Äôt even know? Yes, you can infect others, but they might even get it and not even know either.
Uhhh...source? I think what they actually said was that wearing an N95 rated mask when you weren't sick wasn't likely to prevent you from contracting the illness to such a high degree that it was worth preventing those in direct contact with those who are ill from getting them. Which is still true. The reason to wear a non N95 rated mask has almost nothing to do with preventing you from becoming sick directly, it's primarily to keep you from unknowingly spreading sickness when you're asymptomatic.
Of course the cases are higher than tested, but conducting a peer review on a study is not "muddying the waters". It's important to remain skeptical in science. But yes the number of actual people infected is much more than the confirmed cases
Yeah that's a good point. Still, unless we know how the numbers are calculated, who is counted and who isn't, we shouldn't think of them as accurate.
>So how bad is it, if you have it and don‚Äôt even know? Yes, you can infect others, but they might even get it and not even know either.  And you might end up in the hospital or dead. Are you willing to risk the lives of your parents, spouse or best friend because some asshole didn't feel like taking the proper precautions like the rest of us? Yeah, some might not get sick but it can be death sentence for others. That's why we all have to do our part.
Oh wait- that‚Äôs 300 total since all of this started. Not just ‚Äúcurrently‚Äù.
There's no reason to strawman. That's not what I said. I am just using the study as one vector, for which it is quite useful. I am also not suggesting the cases are higher than the bounds of the study. (I accidentally wrote 50x-85x, but trust you understood)   People wanting a certain outcome will read your post to invalidate mine, which it doesn't.
OK I think we are both done here. I‚Äôm just kind of over the entire thing. Discussing it online never fixes anything. I mean, I agree with you. But at a certain point, it‚Äôs all a bit much. We can die from every other thing we do all day long as well. But we can‚Äôt live in fear every moment of every day. Have a good day and be safe.
I think we're fighting for the same thing here. We can agree cases are much higher than the official count, but it's also important to relay accurate information. The Stanford study itself claimed the 50x-85x and there are multiple peer reviews of the study that take some issue with it. It's fine to skeptical and concerned for the total number of infected
>  We can die from every other thing we do all day long as well  Covid-19 kills more people every day in the US right now than any other single thing.  This is not "all a bit much".  This is how we handle the most dangerous thing that exists in our world at the present moment.
I definitely agree, but I think people looking to confirm their bias will view your initial post without the proper context.
New York State is currently listing any death as COVID-19 related. Kind of a stretch, isn‚Äôt it?
They're listing any death as Covid-19 related? Do you have a source for that?
No, it isn't a stretch.  Since we don't have enough testing equipment, we *know* more people have the virus than reported.  Only the "probable" ones are added to the covid reporting, meaning that they died with symptoms consistent with covid-19 but were unable to get tested before they died.  People getting hit by a bus are not being reported as covid-19 deaths.  Also, the same simple fact is true outside of New York:  Covid-19 kills more people each day within each major geographical area than heart disease (which is the yearly highest cause of death).
Lying during a pandemic is a pretty shit move.
He doesn't, because they're not.  It's a straight up lie.

Covid-19 is spreading to America‚Äôs South with unnerving speed - The Economist 4/22/20
  [https://www.economist.com/united-states/2020/04/21/covid-19-is-spreading-to-americas-south-with-unnerving-speed](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2020/04/21/covid-19-is-spreading-to-americas-south-with-unnerving-speed) ‚ÄúY‚ÄôALL...WE ARE NOT New York state.‚Äù Alabama‚Äôs governor, Kay Ivey, said that on March 26th, explaining why she was not locking her state down. At that time, she was right. The Empire State then had twice as many confirmed cases of coronavirus as all southern states combined (the 11 Confederate states, plus Kentucky). But the South is becoming more like New York.The virus is spreading throughout the region with unnerving speed. Between the end of March and April 20th, the number of cases in the dozen southern states rose from 11,700 to 127,500, three times as fast as the national increase. As elsewhere, the largest concentration of cases has been in cities. Greater Miami and New Orleans both have around 15,000, more than Los Angeles. In the ten days after the first confirmed case in the Big Easy, the number in Louisiana grew faster than anywhere else in the world, says Gary Wagner of the University of Louisiana at Lafayette. In mid-April, the New Orleans area had the highest per-person death rate from covid-19 of any American city, and Louisiana was second to New York state in deaths per person.The South has also seen a rapid spread in suburbs and towns. Figures from the *New York Times* show how fast cases have been doubling in each county. On April 8th the South had 27 counties where they were doubling every two and a half days or more frequently. In the West, there are only three counties where cases were rising that quickly. Most of the areas affected have been suburbs or smaller cities such as Shreveport, Louisiana and Albany, Georgia. The growth rate has since slowed but infections contracted in early April will produce hospitalisations and deaths in early May. According to Mr Wagner, four southern states (Louisiana, Florida, Tennessee and Georgia) had faster growth rates during the first 36 days after their first confirmed cases than Spain or Italy.As a result, the South is entering the most dangerous period in which numbers are large, growth is still high and health systems start to buckle. According to the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, New York and New Jersey have passed the peak of hospital demand but Georgia and Texas will not hit theirs until early May. ‚ÄúThe worst is yet to come,‚Äù fears Peter Hotez, of Baylor University in Waco, Texas. That is worrying not just in itself but because three things make the South especially vulnerable to covid-19.First, state policymakers were slow to respond to the virus and are being quick to loosen the lockdown. Four southern governors waited until early April before issuing stay-at-home orders; that was almost two weeks after California‚Äôs order. Barely three weeks later, seven states have either reopened, or plan to reopen, everything from beaches, gyms and tattoo parlours to shops, restaurants and (in the case of Tennessee) most businesses. As a result, southerners are talking and acting differently. They are more likely than other Americans to say that they are not worried about the virus, according to YouGov, which does polling for *The Economist*. And they have been slow to adopt social distancing. Unacast, a company which analyses online tracking data, found they are limiting daily encounters with others less than most Americans. And four-fifths of counties where people were travelling the most in mid-April are in the south, according to Cuebiq, a measurement company. Infections caught then could turn into disease soon.The second reason for the South‚Äôs vulnerability is demography. The region contains disproportionate numbers of old, black, Hispanic, uninsured, unhealthy and (a sometimes forgotten group) incarcerated Americans. That is an almost complete litany of susceptibilities to covid-19. In Florida‚Äôs Sumter county, home to one of the largest residential complexes for the old (and the fastest-growing metropolitan area in America), the median age is 67, care homes are suffering exponential growth in cases and the county‚Äôs death rate from covid-19 is a sky-high 10%. Florida‚Äôs governor is mobilising the national guard to boost coronavirus virus testing in care homes. His state is not unique. One in six deaths in Louisiana are in care homes. [https://imgur.com/a/sCl93t5](https://imgur.com/a/sCl93t5)  Along with the vulnerable old, African-Americans have disproportionately high mortality rates. In Louisiana, blacks account for 32% of the state‚Äôs population but 70% of covid-19 deaths. In Mississippi, the figures are 37% and 72%. Blacks (and Hispanics) are more likely than whites to live in crowded conditions, more likely to have impaired underlying health and more likely to work in occupations (care workers, government clerks) that bring them into contact with others during quarantine. All these put them at greater risk. Fifty-eight per cent of African-Americans, or 24m people, live in the old confederacy.The region also likes to lock people up and prisoners have much in common with other imperilled groups. A disproportionate number are black and, like care homes and cruise ships, prisons are incubators of the virus. Seven of the top ten states ranked by incarceration rates are in the South. Put all this together and you find that southerners, on average, are sicker than others, more likely to contract the disease and more likely to die if infected. As Louisiana‚Äôs governor put it, we ‚Äúhave more than our fair share of people who have the co-morbidities that make them especially vulnerable,‚Äù meaning more obesity, high blood pressure, asthma and so on. The Gallup Health and Well Being index has worked out an index of covid-19 risk factors by state. Every southern state has above-average risk; four of the five most vulnerable are southern. ‚ÄúA toxic mix,‚Äù says Dr Hotez.Perhaps this might not matter quite so much were it not for the third weakness: the medical system. As elsewhere in America, the South has plenty of large, modern hospitals. But it has more people without health insurance than any other region, with the lack of coverage worst in rural areas. Nineteen rural hospitals closed in 2019, mainly in the South; 170 have shut since 2005, says the Sheps Centre at the University of North Carolina. Some of the problems reflect national trends but southern states have added an extra dimension of their own: politically inspired restriction of health insurance. With fewer rural hospitals, patients must go to rural health clinics, which rely on federal funding. But eight of the 12 southern states have refused an offer to expand Medicaid, a federally funded programme to provide health insurance to the poorest, which was part of Obamacare. That has reduced the ability of clinics to deal with the coming flood of cases and left the very people who are most vulnerable anyway with less medical help.‚ÄúYou could be looking at a perfect storm,‚Äù says Thomas LaVeist, the dean of public health at Tulane University in New Orleans. ‚ÄúWhen this is over, the South will be the region of the country that will be most severely impacted.‚Äù
This picture is outdated. I'm glad I live in NC. We have some of the lowest deaths/1M in the whole country, even with 10.5M people. On the other hand Georgia, FL, Alabama, and Louisiana are a shit show.
Georgia, TN, and SC all relaxing stuff over the next few days too. Exciting times!
As a 25 year subscriber to the economist I can assure you it is not a left wing conspiracy rag.
Man this is spooky af.
i don't know how, but there is a clothing store in atlantic beach that is open and welcoming clients inside. a clothing store. like a women's boutique where shirts are $80. they keep posting all over instagram and saying "thanks to the town of AB for letting us open!" -- does AB have some weird jurisdiction OVER the governor?!  (They are on an island and do actually have their own jurisdiction over Carteret County)
Thank goodness McCrory was such a repugnant fuck he didn‚Äôt get re-elected in NC, but it was way too close. He would have rolled over and licked Trump‚Äôs boots and had everyone back at their jobs exposing each other to Covid already. I hope folks remember and turn out to vote again.
I wonder why?!? (sarcasm)
Thank you. I've been trying to explain this to people all week.
A a nurse who has worked in the NY NJ area before moving here-- the people down here are SO MUCH sicker... So many overweight, diabetes, no doctor check ups... we are in the Stroke Belt.... This is a perfect storm waiting to happen. So many people are in denial down here.. I still see people going about their days... no precautions... It sickens me... Just a ticking time bomb
thank you for laying all of this out.      God, even if Bernie would have won it wouldn't have been in time to get Medicare for all in place. This world feels so bleak.
For now. As long as we collectively keep our social distancing measures in place and only go out as needed, we'll be alright I think
> On the other hand Georgia, FL, Alabama, and Louisiana are a shit show  Having moved from one of these states.. When aren't they? I wish them the best, but they've (those states leaders) crossed a point of no return. It's going to be difficult to steer a different direction.
So we're surrounded by dipshittery on all sides. Hold out, Virginia! Hoooollllld!
The TN Governor is lifting his order, but the trick will be if the cities do.  If I recall all the big cities are Democrat unlike the Governor.  I‚Äôve heard from a friend back in Memphis that the city mayor is extending his stay at home another two weeks which is the time extent of city law.  He expects that the mayor will keep extending as needed no matter what the governor says.  Memphis and its county are having to fight a Christian School that wants to reopen.
Exciting times indeed!
Why is it exciting times, isn't it terrifying times?
Well with all the ReOpenNC schmucks I think they're going to nullify much of if not all the progress the state has been making. Still a wait and see scenario. But I hope that Gov. Cooper sticks to his wits and makes appropriate decisions based on what the Dr's and Scientist say. And not lean too much into corporate interest over the health of the citizens.
Agree.  10 or so years subscriber here.
yup been reading it since I was in college in the 80's they will NEVER be considered left-wing. If people think they are, they need to have their head examined
I too feel spooked after reading it. Eeps. In the beginning I was bleaching things a lot more often. I'd bleach the bottom of my shoes after being out even. But I got lax in the last week or two. Not time to relax yet.
Unlikely. I believe if local and state SAH orders differ, residents and business owners are supposed to follow whichever is more stringent. At least that‚Äôs the case in Wake County.
Yeah that's what I have been doing. I specifically think it has to do with our excellent healthcare systems, quick reacting RTP companies to shut down as well as most universities/ school systems shutting down quickly.
I only hope it doesn't turn in to a "Hold the door" situation.
Sarcasm doesn't translate well in text. They're being sarcastic.
Speaking as a millennial that's been dealing with the 2nd/3rd recession.... I'm not phased by these anymore.   I'm just waiting for this whole bit to make the housing-market affordable.
I know someone that after they go out they take a shower and change clothes. Idk if it needs to be that extreme but they swear it helped cut down on getting sick after they did a lot of air travel. Just when I thought the curve was flattening :(.
Are you 80 years old with diabetes? If not, you're probably being a bit paranoid.
I work at a company in RTP and we started working from home in early March.
And a Democratic governor, like VA. The southern Republican governors (except for Texas, which is secure enough in its identity to buck the trend) have generally seemed more scared of their own voters than of the death toll. Cooper acted a little slowly, but still decisively when the time came.
He is also a Democratic governor so I think he's under my pressure politically to not act too fast
I got wooshed, I couldn't tell if it was like they didn't believe it and thus excited it was opening. Im dur
I've honestly been doing that myself. It may be excessive but it gives me more feeling of control. Which I'm sure a lot of people are feeling a lack of right now.
Please educate yourself on the risks to everyone.   [https://www.statnews.com/2020/04/21/he-ran-marathons-why-did-coronavirus-almost-kill-him/](https://www.statnews.com/2020/04/21/he-ran-marathons-why-did-coronavirus-almost-kill-him/)
I work at a firm not in RTP and I think I was sent home on like March 14th.
Friendly reminder that Cooper was required to wait for the recommendation from the DHHS
What are you talking about? Sorry, but the widespread studies now being conducted and reviewed do not back up your random anecdotal article from "statnews.com".  Co-morbidities and age are OVERWHELMINGLY correlated with mortality when it comes to COVID.  If you're a healthy young adult, you are taking more of a risk getting in your car during a normal commute than you are catching this virus.  Please don't let scary anecdotes lead you away from actual statistics.
Cary worker. I also did my last day in the office on March 14th. My wife also has been home since then as well.
Your statement struck me as the type of "if you're healthy and in your 20's you have absolutely nothing to fear, it'll be a minor cold." But you do need to be careful, it is still deadly to otherwise healthy people. It won't always just be mild. It's not scary anecdotes, it's factual data that otherwise healthy people can and are getting very ill.
I too was home on March 14, but that's because it was Saturday
It is scary anecdotes though, because the statistical data show that a TINY, TINY number of otherwise healthy people who contract the virus end up with severe symptoms requiring hospitalization.  Look at the data coming out of NY today - according to the 3,000 person sample, the actual mortality rate might be closer to 0.6% (https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/23/new-york-antibody-study-estimates-13point9percent-of-residents-have-had-the-coronavirus-cuomo-says.html).  And another study from NYC showed that 94% of those who were hospitalized had one or more illnesses (88% had more than one): https://time.com/5825485/coronavirus-risk-factors/  So, if only 0.6% of people who get this are dying, and 94% of them have existing illnesses, all I'm saying is that healthy people have little to fear themselves. Unfortunately, tons of Americans are not healthy. Obesity (BMI > 30) and hypertension are incredibly common, so we're taking these precautions to protect them. Just don't think you're really at risk unless you are.  Listen, I'm not one of the protesters screaming for us to re-open tomorrow with no precautions, but I think it's important to stay calm, understand the facts, and not fall victim to the fear-mongering news (who profit from our fear-based viewership).
I think there is another side to that though, and telling people that you are being paranoid for taking measure to be safer does more harm than good. There is nothing wrong with wearing a mask and being safe. Your original statement sounded far more like if you're in your 20's and healthy go about your normal routine than advocating for caution.
Yeah, my original statement lacked nuance and context.  I'm just getting tired of how scared people are when they shouldn't be. You can be cautious and respectful without spreading fear and uncertainty.

Employee at Target in Holly Springs tested Positive for CoViD-19.

I got news for ya - because testing is being rationed and withheld so much, I can pretty much guarantee that you have been in several locations where an employee had CoVID, to say nothing of the other shoppers or patrons.
They didn't say when the employee got tested, and what days he or she was in the store and during what hours.  Well, what is this information good for then?  We don't have that many confirmed cases in the state (or Wake county), but for whatever reason there seems to be no effort in contact tracing. Not even fool-proof contact tracing, how about just best-effort?  There are establishments I visit (Food Lion and occasional take out from here or there) and I have no idea if I have come in contact with anyone or multiple people who has the virus. Not even with a casual customer but employees of the said places.  If the issue is privacy issues, ok then tell us so. Say we can't do even minimal contact tracing without someone losing their anonymity or violating the law.  I hope there are plans to address this.  edit: For the record, [this surveillance report](https://files.nc.gov/ncdhhs/documents/files/covid-19/Weekly-COVID19-Surveillance.pdf) from the state is updated weekly. It has some useful data but the regions are way too large to be of immediate value to most of us.
Seems like a great time to reopen the economy.
It's OK, he's been taken to the hospital, where doctors immediately injected him with disinfectant, shone UV light on all his insides, and sent him home.
Wrote a song about it.  Wanna hear it? Here it go...
Did she bite anyone?
I *do* see the point in announcing this- to remind people to *assume there is someone positive but not showing symptoms everywhere they go.*  Here's another one from a couple of weeks ago, when the case count was much lower.  [Positive cases among employees at Lowe's Hardware in Garner and also in Apex.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Lowes_Employees/comments/fwzeet/keep_track_lowes_employee_coronavirus_cases/)  The thread is about cases at Lowe's Hardware in general, nationally, there are a lot.  Lowe's was a bit slow to adapt to social distancing, but they have adapted now.  I'm not sure they're much different than any other retailer, in terms of infection rate.  We need to think hard about going out. It is a real risk, and our choice exposes others to risk.  Target sells essential items, but they sell a lot of non- essential shit.  How many trips, and how many hours in the store, were not essential?
People don‚Äôt want to assume that and if you go out at all you can see only a fraction of the people going into stores are wearing masks. I think the point ln sharing this is that if even a handful of people start taking it more serious because they realize its in their town then there is a benefit
I've had fever and cough for two weeks at this point, and been told there‚Äôs pretty much no chance of me getting tested because I‚Äôm not in an at-risk population or a healthcare worker. Realistically speaking we have absolutely no idea how many people are infected, so you should assume that everyone is.
There are 500+ investigators in NC contact tracing the virus. They need a lot more according to Roy. Considering no one on the federal level is even talking about contact tracing this is a good sign for NC.
I'll note that the confirmed cases in Wake County are only the serious cases. People who have mild symptoms or have no symptoms at all (could be 60%+ of the cases) are being told not to get tested due to a shortage of tests.
> Well, what is this information good for then?  It's a reminder that we are not out of the woods yet.   It's a reminder that as many of us as possible should stay home.   It's a reminder that if you go out, practice social distancing.    It's a reminder to wear a mask in public to protect other people from you.   It's a reminder to wash your hands and don't touch your face.         Would the specifics be nice?  Maybe.  But those specifics don't change any of the above for anyone, anywhere.  So do the specifics actually matter?
You don't get many positives without testing people.    We are not testing enough therefore we don't have many positives on the record.
I am glad we agree
Not funny dude.  Zombies kill millions of people on TV every year.  TMYK!
LMAOO
Not sure where you're shopping but at the Food Lion near my house I'd estimate 80% of customers were wearing masks the last two times I went. I'm in N. Raleigh.
I‚Äôm glad to hear that but I‚Äôm not glad that I didn‚Äôt hear anything else so far in contact tracing. Look - I don‚Äôt blame Roy. We have an insane state legislative and do not even have a budget. It can‚Äôt be easy to try to fight this with your one hand tied.   But can these 500 investigators publish a quick report or something once in a while? Something that says 1 case at HS Target, employer worked there on 4/10 and was tested on 4/12, positive on 4/15.  And if that‚Äôs a bad idea (perhaps would cause too much panic?) then that‚Äôs fine too.  Or if you say that, people can figure out who the employee is and that‚Äôs against the law, then ok say that, or address it.  Or if we need a thousand more investigators, beat the drums in that.   I‚Äôm just not sure how we will ‚Äúreopen‚Äù if we continue flying this blind.
Yes I understand, of course. Sure testing is lacking, but should contact tracing be lacking too? Doesn‚Äôt it make sense to share at least the data we know about the confirmed cases?
Thats good to hear tbf i havent been out in a few days
It absolutely shouldn't be, this is why the governments response is proving problematic.   There was and is no clear plan, it's everyone for themselves, people still doubt the seriousness, scientists and doctors are not incharge , etc.

Please sign this petition to allow Wake Tech to Move to a Pass/Fail grading system due to covid-19. Almost all other colleges have implemented this system, however Wake Tech is reluctant.

If wake tech goes pass/fail it will jeopardize students‚Äô in the transfer track in that their course may not transfer to the university they are trying to gain entrance to.
Wouldn‚Äôt this be better suited going around the students rather than outside pressure?
They might be hoping to get it to wake tech students through the Raleigh subreddit

ReOpen NC leader tested positive for COVID-19

To be honest I don't believe her.   I know people who've been sick and couldn't get a test. So how did she get one two weeks ago? Seems like a wasted test.
The news observer article has been amended with this:  ‚ÄúWe all had severe coughs and I was having trouble breathing at night,‚Äù Whitlock said, ‚Äúwaking gasping for air.‚Äù  She said one of her children saw a doctor and was told it was a weak case of the flu. No coronavirus test was performed at that time, she said.  ‚ÄúWhen they started doing antibody testing (select labs) I went and had one done just out of curiosity to see if what I had in Feb was COVID,‚Äù Whitlock said. ‚ÄúThe test came back positive for COVID and negative for the antibodies, so I had a CDC test performed.‚Äù     ... When did we start public antibody tests?
She probably lied about having it. Now she's getting tons of free publicity for her "cause" from local and national news services
oh how the turntables...
>One of three mothers who said they started the ReOpenNC protest has tested positive for COVID-19. She said she was in a two week quarantine that ended Sunday and was asymptomatic.  >It's unclear if she attended the protest last week, which drew hundreds downtown, since was was under quarantine.
Oh this article is gold. She‚Äôs more concerned about how mandatory quarantine affects her first amendment right to express her religion than she is getting others sick
The amount of vitriol born of ignorance in comments on this thread and others against people that want to re-open our economy are atrocious. People are so locked into their own way of thinking or conditioned way of thinking that they are incapable of learning truths beyond what they are spoon fed by the media. There is no balance in thought or response to the issues we are facing.     The simplest amount of research and critical thinking reveals truths not discussed by most of our leaders, nor most of the talking heads in media. We are headed for catastrophic economic and societal collapse if we do not re-open our economy. The evidence is all around us.      Lets start with a few google searches that recently hit record highs since google started doing internet searches in 2004. Two apply nationally and one is specific to our state of North Carolina.

Virtually all non-COVID and non-essential healthcare has been suspended. People for the most part aren't getting physicals, cancer screenings, life altering surgeries, biopsies, or any pro-active diagnostic care that reduces death rates from heart disease, diabetes, kidney disease, etc. How many people are going to die in the coming 1 to 2 years because we shut them out from healthcare?

How many are we going to lose this time because we shut people out of healthcare? One million, two million, five million?     Millions of small businesses and tens of millions of people are being rapidly pushed towards economic insolvency. Why? Because our medical and government leaders continue to take an increasingly myopic view of this virus.      Initial quarantine strategies were warranted as we came to understand the virus and pandemic with which we are dealing. It has now become increasingly clear that infection rates are much, much higher. Antibody tests across the world to include our own cities are finding [**COVID exposure rates as high as 25%**](https://newyork.cbslocal.com/2020/04/27/coronavirus-antibodies-present-in-nearly-25-of-all-nyc-residents/).

We are causing far, far, far, far more damage the longer we remain under forced quarantine than we are if we re-open. Keeping the economy closed will cause a catastrophic collapse of our economy and society.      It is time for us to take action. The state and federal governments are operating out of a sense of irrational panic. Civil disobedience is not only called for at this point to avoid our own self-destruction, but warranted.      If you are a Raleigh small business, and you re-open for business of your own volition with the same precautions being used at grocery stores, liquor stores, hardware stores, banks, etc, I will do business with you.     If you are a Raleigh barber that opens of your own volition using appropriate precautions, I will come get my hair cut from you.      If you are a Raleigh restaurant that opens your dining room of your own volition using appropriate precautions, I will come get a meal served by you.      It is time for us to end this bureaucratic nightmare. We cannot afford to wait for the asinine schedule laid out for our state last week. The virus isn't going anywhere. It is not nearly as dangerous as we've been lead to believe, nor is a cure anywhere in site. We must fully function as best as possible and safely as possible or we face repercussions far more serious than those from the virus itself.      Feel free to share elsewhere. I will do the same where I think appropriate.

If she could prove that she was in direct contact with someone else who had tested positive then she would have gotten priority, not that she deserved it.
Yea, this all seems fishy...  Why would someone who doesn‚Äôt believe it to be a real threat go out of their way to get testing (that most people cannot get even when showing many symptoms!)...and an antibody test no less?? Where can the public go to get them?
She claims she wasn't there and still in quarantine, but I'm sure there's no proof.

How often are you going to post your already debunked stats about COVID-19's infection fatality rate (IFR)? For those who didn't see it in the other thread: *at least 0.14%* of NYC residents *are* *already dead* from COVID-19, and antibody tests show that *only 25%* have been infected. That's an IFR of *at least 0.59%*.  [Tyson](https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/22/business/tyson-pork-plant-iowa-coronavirus/index.html), [Smithfield](https://www.newsweek.com/another-smithfield-meat-processing-plant-shuts-down-over-coronavirus-concerns-1500285), and others are closing meat processing plants because of *huge outbreaks of COVID-19* in their workforce. Do you think meat plant workers are sacrificial lambs who should still go to work even when hundreds of their co-workers are infected? If we don't drive the infection spread down restaurants won't be able to operate this summer because there won't be [*any meat*](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/meat-shortage-looms-as-coronavirus-shuts-packing-plants-leaving-farmers-with-tough-choices-2020-04-24)*.*
Or there's like... the progressive policies that already account for the health and well-being of the people without capitalism's boot on their neck. We've been out here a long time fighting for these policies and not going to sacrifice meat the capitalist machine to get them.   Good try on trying to steal leftist rhetoric to guilt-trip people though. How's that been working out for you?
Sounds like you need to add some lysol injections to go along with the bleach injections.
Her story now is that she went to get an antibody test because she and her kids were sick in February.
She also said asymptomatic positive...   And then when asked why she got tested describing her family and her having symptoms in February?
So we‚Äôre surprised that she‚Äôs full of crap?
She was tested two weeks ago.
She just told ABC 11 ‚Äúno comment‚Äù when they asked.  Source:   https://twitter.com/KaplanABC11/status/1254793445392158722?s=20
It's published data from researchers at two esteemed universities reported on by a well known online newspaper. If you don't like that study, find any of the numerous other studies that are showing the mortality rates to be 10x to 50x less than the numbers that have been put out by the media, government, or medical officials. More keep coming out. It only takes seconds of searching to find them from all over the world.  Maybe the Stanford study has been debunked, maybe it hasn't, but should that stop the discussion that the official numbers are equally or even more flawed? Does it change that we are currently overestimating the lethality of COVID19? How will the lower mortality numbers of COVID19 compare to the increases in suicides as well as undiagnosed cancers, diabetes, and heart disease deaths in the coming year?
Which would mean she‚Äôs fibbing about being asymptomatic and thus I don‚Äôt trust her claims that she didn‚Äôt attend the rally while she was supposed to be under quarantine.
Definitely consistently inconsistent.  Not to mention, it makes me suspicious that her pants may be on fire about not attending the openNCnow rally while she was supposed to be quarantined.
On the Facebook Group, she said she was not there. She also said that she told every news outlet "no comment" because she is not the media contact for the group. Just relaying what I saw on the FB group. I have no idea if that's the truth or not.
You mean like this [one](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.15.20066431v1.full.pdf), from esteemed researchers at Yale, UMass, and NIH?  ***Results***  *There were notable increases in the rate of death due to P&I in February and March 2020. In a number of states, these deaths pre-dated increases in COVID-19 testing rates and were not counted in official records as related to COVID-19. There was substantial variability between states in the discrepancy between reported rates of death due to COVID-19 and the estimated burden of excess deaths due to P&I. The increase in all-cause deaths in New York and New Jersey is 1.5-3 times higher than the official tally of COVID-19 confirmed deaths or the estimated excess death due to P&I.*  ***Conclusions***  *Excess P&I deaths provide a conservative estimate of COVID-19 burden and indicate that COVID-19-related deaths are missed in locations with inadequate testing or intense pandemic activity.*  Why don't *you* post all of these so-called studies that estimate that the mortality rates are the "10x to 50x less than the numbers that have been put out by the media, government, or medical officials."
Yeah it sounds like she is full of shit. Shocker.
I looked her up on LinkedIn yesterday.  She's a professional marketing person.  This is too convenient for me to not be super skeptical of this whole story.
Symptoms in February sometime.  She was at a Church service 3/22 (2nd photo): https://www.gastongazette.com/photogallery/NC/20200322/PHOTOGALLERY/322009994/PH/1  Quarantined 4/12-4/26.
[**Here's a study done in Miami.**](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/coronavirus/article242260406.html) About 6 percent of Miami-Dade‚Äôs population ‚Äî about 165,000 residents ‚Äî have antibodies indicating a past infection by the novel coronavirus, dwarfing the state health department‚Äôs tally of about 10,600 cases, according to preliminary study results announced by University of Miami researchers Friday. Obviously the number of deaths remains unchanged, but now the mortality rate is based on being divided by 165,000 instead of 10,600. There have been 300 deaths in Miami-Dade. The mortality rate drops from 2.83% to .181%, a death rate approximately 15x smaller than previously thought.      [**New data released today from the New York State.**](https://metro.co.uk/2020/04/27/approximately-15-percent-new-yorkers-already-coronavirus-study-says-12617886/) On Monday, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said that preliminary results from a statewide study suggest that 14.9% of New Yorkers have the antibody for the virus, meaning that they have already contracted Covid-19. New York State has 19.45 million residents. An infection rate of 14.9% equals 2.9 million residents instead of the 288,000 cases currently listed. Obviously the number of deaths remains unchanged at 22,230. This changes the mortality rate in the state of New York state from 7.72% to .767%, a death rate approximately 10x smaller than previously thought.      So again... for the third time. We are currently overestimating the lethality of COVID19. How will the lower mortality numbers of COVID19 compare to the increase in suicides as well as deaths from delayed or undiagnosed cases of cancer, diabetes, and heart disease in the coming year?
Who is "we"? You are comparing earlier estimates of naive CFR (#dead/#confirmed positive) to IFR (#dead/#resolved cases). No-one has claimed that IFR would be > 1%. Glad you agree that IFR in NY state is 0.767% instead of the 0.1-0.2% number you posted earlier. That is *only* 7x worse than a bad flu year. And, regarding the Miami-Dade study, which you don't link to, the accuracy of the results will depend on the specificity of the test (the false positive rate), which in some serological tests has been as high as 3%. That has a bigger effect when the number of detected positives is low (Miami-Dade) than when it is higher (NY).  State restrictions on elective hospital procedures will probably lift in May. That doesn't mean that physicians and dentists will rush to see patients again if they are afraid of being infected themselves. And speaking of suicides: https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/nyregion/new-york-city-doctor-suicide-coronavirus.html
New York State is skewed by New York City. It has the greatest population density of any metropolitan area in the United States. Over half the population of New York commutes daily on their subway system. The city itself has a homeless population greater than the entire population of Chapel Hill. It is an outlier. It is near the top of the mortality rate in our country.      Restrictions will "probably" lift in May. That'll be about 2 to 3 months once things get started back up without physicals, cancer screenings, life altering surgeries, biopsies, or any pro-active diagnostic care that reduces death rates. Add on top of that the previously pointed out rise in cancer deaths that occurred as a result of our last recession that we can more than likely expect again.      So again... for the fourth time. How will the lower mortality numbers of COVID19 compare to the increase in suicides as well as deaths from delayed or undiagnosed cases of cancer, diabetes, and heart disease in the coming year? Will more people die from COVID19 or will more people die from the consequences of our response to COVID19?
Who knows? Probably a lot. Probably less than the million+ US deaths we could experience if we don't socially distance.  "Our response" to COVID-19 isn't just compliance with government dictates, it is also the rational response of millions of people who don't want to catch or spread a potentially deadly virus. Just because the state allows medical professionals to see patients doesn't mean all of them will do so. Just because restaurants and bars and retail re-open doesn't mean they will have customers. I usually eat out 3-4 times a week. Not anymore. I don't know anyone who plans to go to a restaurant again this year, and that includes a restaurant owner!
And that rational response need not involve selective mandates in order to participate. If people wish to remain isolated, they may do so. We are doing catastrophic damage to society and the economy the longer we mandate closures. Your idea of rational self quarantining is one based on individual choice, NOT selective mandates.

hahaha - Leader of North Carolina lockdown Protest group tests positive for COVID-19

If she was asymptomatic how did she get a test? I have a feeling she‚Äôs lying and trying to use it as a way to convince people covid is harmless
She's also planning to attend another protest this week.
fucking idiots - serves them right  hope they all get better while shutting the fuck up
Please please let that idiot also have one of those dumb fucking cards that says they refuse CoVid19 treatment
agreed.   didn't they do drive-thru testing a couple weeks ago only for nurses and after most came back positive they shut it down?   I'm still waiting to get at least an antibody test before thinking of things going back to normal
I‚Äôll have to look into that. Cant she go to prison for that?
I highly doubt that she‚Äôs a nurse but who knows. My mom is in healthcare and can‚Äôt get a test so
I don't think so. She also says she complied with the 2 week quarantine and after that you're supposed to be okay to do essential activities again
agreed again. Tell your mom thank you and stay safe!
how did she know she had the virus if she was asymptomatic?
Thank you friend!! She‚Äôs also in her 60s so this is a scary time :/
She also claims at one point to have had symptoms. She's not necessarily a reliable source.

First confirmed (in US) case of family dog testing positive for Covid-19 found in Chapel Hill

I‚Äôm glad the family and Winston are doing okay.
I wish the media wouldn't report on this for a single case. Just last month there were various states and countries that had issues with people giving up their pets for fears like this, and with 1 case it's only going to cause more animals to need homes.
So they gave their dog COVID 19. They have two dogs, a cat, and a lizard. Only one dog out of all the other pets tested positive.  Also, the parents are both front line care providers, and they have stated that they are not worried.
‚Äú(The dog) licks all of our dinner plates...‚Äù said McLean's son, Ben.   Umm....aside from the point of the article, this is gross, but you do you.
This is my classmate! It's amazing they found this out, and her whole family's doing great, including Winston.
Are tests no longer in short supply?  You'd think that the choice between "testing a dog" and "testing a human" might have come out the other way.
Prewash
You do wash your plates before you reuse them, right?
Not sure why you are getting downvoted. I love my dog but he has his own plate.
I have a question for all the people super grossed out by this. How do you handle raw poultry? Does it never touch a plate? If it does do you throw that plate out? If you trust your dishwasher to clean chicken juice, you can trust to clean after a dog.
We call it ‚Äúplate service‚Äù and boy do they come running when they hear those words!
You‚Äôve never owned a dog have you?
Growing up my mom would always let our dog clean her plate. I thought it was a crass act and i never did.   Sometimes if i am feeling lazy I will not shop the cat away if they start up but that's a sign I need to do something productive.   I see what everyone is saying; you wash the dishes so there is little harm. It's still a trashy thing to do.
Why is this gross? You rinse your plates before putting them in the dishwasher, don't you?
I caught my adult daughter doing that after we had dinner at her house. I came unglued. It is gross. Yes i know they are washed before next use but it still to much for many to deal with. I told her plain and simple i would not be eating at her house again if thats something she does not stop doing.  Its bad for the dogs to be eaing human food on top of it again being gross.  She was raised with dogs around and we didnt do that. A  treat of human food here and there can be overlooked but dog licking the plates the humans use is a deal breaker. She was also letting her cat on the kitchen counter. Again i told her she has to wrk on that.  folks dont want too eat food that was prepared in a kitchen where the cat walked on the counters with same paws it was diggin in its shit and piss in its litter box at some point during that day.
The mother of the family, who is an MD, said the dog was exhibiting symptoms.  *Saw your other comment. I did not know a dog exhibiting symptoms and testing positive for the virus means it was not infected with it.
... What? You don't throw yours away and buy new ones every time? My God, this is brilliant! I'll save so muhh money!
Dog owner here and my dog has never licked our plates.
Part of the problem is dogs shouldnt be eating a lot of what's left on human food plates. Its not just chocolate and raisins you know. Garlic, onions, small bones, and more are all harmful to dogs.
My raw poultry doesn't lick its own ass or eat shit for fun.
I am cringing at this lol
I‚Äôve had several dogs in my life and they don‚Äôt lick our plates.
Is she a grown adult?
It's definitely bad for the dog, but how is dog spit worse than all the people spit that gets on plates? She's just going to pretend to stop doing it and you're never going to know the difference.
I believe one of the choke points was the insanely menacingly long swab used to administer the human version was only manufactured in Italy. I don't they would need something so long on a pug.  Thinking about that just made me laugh about this whole thing.
Yeah, cutting live animals open and butchering them in an open air space is just like a dog licking a plate.
Ok but you still wash them before you reuse them, correct?
Says you. You don't know what the poultry's into.
Saves a lot of water and work washing dishes. :D
I‚Äôm sorry you love such a joyless life.
Yes.  Grown adult does not make anyone not need some advice or guidance from thier folks or grandparents now and again.   I got advice from my dad untiil he died. I was 45 or so at the time.  Most of it was good.  some useless. I just gave him a yes sir, ill take that into consideration in the future. Thanks,  Thats all i ask of my kid and would make mst parents happy.   I am 52 and there still are times i wish i could get some guidance on things from him. Mom still gives me advice.   She is a grown ass adult but a week into raising an infant all of the sudden some of the advice mom and dad had been giving was worth listening to.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a pug we can just use a q-tip!‚Äù
No - it's sort of like grill grates.  The buildup of food "seasons" the plates over time and results in tastier meals.
Why is your dog eating off plates for people? Human food isn't good for dogs.
üòÇ touche
Of all the things to be high-and-mighty about, this is the one people are choosing?
I love my dog and he‚Äôs a wonderful companion, but he has his dish and I have mine.
Yeah because you sound like you are just full of joy.
You let your dogs lick your dinner plates? The same plates you would serve guest on? And this brings you joy? Ok...guess we all have our thing.
Perhaps you could start doing some of the listening to her... it is her house, her pets, and her child. You don‚Äôt have to like it and clearly you don‚Äôt have to visit - you can do so without verbally expressing it. Advice isn‚Äôt verbally bashing someone‚Äôs over doing things differently than you. That‚Äôs not love. That‚Äôs not advice. That is being a bully.   She is an adult now and the choices are hers. You are free to live your life as you see fit, allow her to do the same. Show her some respect in her own house.
There are lots of religions and cultures that think of all animals as "unclean". That's fine for you, whatever, but that's not mainstream American thinking and don't presume to apply it to others. More than anything, telling others how they should live their lives WHEN IT DOESN'T AFFECT YOU AT ALL is literally the most gross and un-American thing you could do.
Cursed culinary
My dog isn‚Äôt. I just think it‚Äôs hilarious that people who seemingly don‚Äôt wash their plates between uses are worried about other people who do but also let their dog lick them.
Is dog food good for humans?
Most human food is good for dogs. You do need to know what to avoid (onions, chives, garlic, chocolate, etc) but a dog will be perfectly healthy eating the same meat, veggies and fruit as you do, for the most part.
Welcome to Reddit.
How about... and I'm just spitballing here, so bear with me... after you use the plates, you *wash* them?
Yes, yes, and yes. Would you like to come over?
dumb ass advice. You really think that this parents should stop seeing their child because the child does something disgusting and worthless?
check back a few weeks into your first kid and we can revisit your opinion.   Here is the defination of bully for you. Giving advice on things is not a bully.  Saying i would not eat in her house if it was not healthly enviroment to be preparing food in is not a bully.   https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bully
Pets come and go.  They are not family, kids, furbabies whatever. They are pets.   When i was a teeenager and we lost a family pet i thought it was the end of the world. I got a bit older and learned the diff betweeen having to deal with the loss of a pet and a close family member. They are not even close to the same thing.
it effects me if i have to eat off dishes a the dog licked or eat food prepared in a kitchen with cats stepping all over the place. Thaats why i left it at if you do that i wont eat at your house.   Its now them in my house and itts not a problem  it was not a problem even at her house. Once it was pointed out to her hw gross and unhealthly the two things were (i have no idea why she needed me to and her mother to point it out to her, we clearrly failed to teach her that) it stopped as far as i know.
IDK, to me this would be like using your towels as cum rags and then letting other people use them. Sure, the towels are cleaned and washed but the practice is questionable...
haha yes washing cleans dishes, however, IMO just because you can wash a dish shouldn't mean you use that dish for all purposes. Like I'm not going to use a plate for gardening or weird sexual festishes just because it can be washed....but hey...my eyes are now open....
No thanks! However, you have confirmed my distrust of potlucks. Like I'll pass on Brenda's casserole that is served in her multipurpose dish used for her cats and humans. But, hey, I'm glad she has joy.
The ‚Äúchild‚Äù is an adult.   It‚Äôs not advice, it‚Äôs my opinion.   Just as ‚Äúdisgusting and worthless‚Äù is your opinion.
You don‚Äôt know me AT ALL ... I am a mother of two.   Thanks. Respect your daughter and her life, don‚Äôt be a bully.  Just don‚Äôt go to her house... you don‚Äôt have to give the ultimatum. You aren‚Äôt giving advice - you have given her an ultimatum. Do things my way or ‚Äúelse‚Äù...   Have a nice day and ‚Äúbless your heart‚Äù
Haha go away. Please. Your antiquated thinking belongs in the 70‚Äôs
FWIW...some people have little to no friends or family in life. A pet may be the only thing who loves them with a full heart. A pet may be the only thing that needs them to keep on living. Some pets are more serious to some than others.   I do agree dogs shouldn‚Äôt be licking off a dinner plate, even if they are your best friend.
I agree, Pets are not people. I love, love, love my dog ... but that love doesn‚Äôt make him a person.
Every hand towel and towel you‚Äôve ever used at a hotel has been used as a cum rag. Half the plates at every restaurant you‚Äôve ever been to has had coke sniffed off of them. Most of the surfaces at your favorite restaurant have been fucked on. You getting the heebie jeebies when you think about it doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not happening, and also does not impact the efficacy of sanitation processes.
You should never eat out at a restaurant then. Who knows what happens to all those plates from either the person before you, or some weird shit that may go on in the kitchen.
Please do, Brenda‚Äôs casserole is too good for you.
I didn't say your opinion was disgusting, learn to read. The dog licking plates is disgusting and worthless. I'd hate to live in a world where families treat each other the way you think they should. Extremely obvious you don't have children of age. I hope when you do that you don't follow your terrible advice.
Stop using bully wrong you bully.  Its not my way or else.  Its do whats generally accaptable  and does not put others (including my grandon) health at risk or i wont be a part of it.
Dogs not eating off the family plates is not a 70s thing.  Spend a bit of time with hunters or some service dogs and you start to see them as more than a pet.  They often are a tool.  even as just a pet they serve a purpose but they are not humans.  They lick thier nuts anytme they want. They are not shy about licking thier ass. They will eat cat poop out of the litter box if you let them. They dont grow out of gross stuff.  its what they do.  I aint eating off the same plate they lick every night.  Aint no home dishwasher making that plate clean enough for me and many others to be ok with it.
Fact: Pets are not people
I'm talking about a person knowingly doing dirty shit and knowingly allowing others to use it because "hey your hotel towels may have cum on it" or hey a plate you use at a restaurant may have been licked by a dog so you should use my plates which I encourage the dog to use...this doesn't seem wierd to you?
It's really not a big deal, I just had no idea how common it was to allow a dog to eat from a plate outside of the dog getting accidental access to a plate left out. But, I am highly selective about the restaurants I eat at. And using your logic do you think restaurants that allow dogs on the patio and bring dogs bowls of water are using the same bowls they serve their non four legged guest? If the answer is no, why do you think they choose not to?
You don‚Äôt know me ... and perhaps you should work on your reading & critical thinking skills.   What are ‚Äúchildren of age‚Äù?
That is an ultimatum, not advice.   Your grandson = Her child   Respect her life. It is not your house.
Most dogs that are trained do none of that. But you do you, boomer.
Lol wow I'm astonished at the amount of pearl clutching in this thread regarding plates. The idea is to CLEAN THEM, people. You think a dogs tongue makes a plate irredeemably gross?   How about the majority of people who throw plates with stuck on food and shit in their lukewarm, damp dishwasher to sit for a week before its run? Those germs and bacteria don't bother you? Or restaurants where god knows what happens in the back? Can't believe how many germaphones are on reddit sheesh
Agree, and I didn‚Äôt say otherwise. Just mentioned that pets are important and considered family members to some.
I mean it‚Äôs not something I would do but it‚Äôs getting washed. I‚Äôd be more concerned with the dead carcass I just ate off the plate being a danger to me than dog slobber that‚Äôs been washed off.
I was more referring to just how gross most restaurants are. I've had lipstick on the side of cups before for example. It didn't smell of whatever drink was in it before, but it still didn't look clean.  And most restaurants that I see that allow dogs have a big bowl for all the dogs to use. And why don't they use the same bowls they use to serve people with? Because it's easier to have one big bowl for the dogs they can just refill and maybe wash out every day or every other day. It's a little different.   I really don't understand the hangup about a pet licking a plate/bowl before you wash it. Do you not trust yourself to wash a dish properly? Or for your dishwasher? Do you have the same hangup about anything raw meat might touch? Do you have a raw meat only plate? (Raw meat only chopping boards are common though, especially if you have wooden boards) What about utensils that touch raw meat while you're cooking? It's really the same idea.  If you're terrified of germs on your plate *before* you wash them, I wonder how you've made it this far in life.
Grown children
It is now my house the child is living at so.....  Yeh, grandpa and grandma stepped up purchased a house with room for 5 and took over full time care for the kid and the damn pets for the last 6 months while her and her husband tie up a few loose ends with the army back at the old place and some help from corna not allowing visiits the last 45 or so days.   I think i get to say how things should be done now and agian.
A lot of humans are more gross than animals too. Idk how many adults I‚Äôve seen pick their noses and eat it, and scratch themselves or go to the bathroom without washing hands hahaha.
I‚Äôve let my dog eat or drink out of bowls that I also eat or drink out of too. Sometimes when I cut his nails I‚Äôll put some peanut butter and banana in a bowl for him, then I wash it after. It‚Äôs not like my dog is eating off the bowl at the same time as me.  I‚Äôve also given him a piece of food off a fork when I was done with it haha.  I don‚Äôt really get bothered by it, I live with these animals and they share my bed/couch/chairs etc, letting them use a bowl isn‚Äôt a problem.  Then again I also don‚Äôt have much manners in my own house haha, I‚Äôll lick my own plates clean and eat things with my hands, occasionally stab a steak with a fork and eat it without cutting it like a barbarian lmao.  I also clean my whole house and dishes really thoroughly so I don‚Äôt see an issue, it‚Äôs a you do you situation hahaha.   Personally if I invite people over they‚Äôre using paper plates and plastic cups anyway, I don‚Äôt wanna wash a bunch of peoples dishes lol!
I get the dog slobber on the plate then washed is all in a persons head. its not cool to do because so many folks find it very gross. Do it like grown men watch romantic comdies.  Alone and then nevertalk about it.   I have worked as a dishwasher. I know what happens in kitchens. I almost never eat meals out because of it. I also wont eat food at potlucks because i have no idea how clean the food preperation area in peoples houses is. My wife reminds me often i am a bit over the top about it.
Look, my kids have kiddy dishes. My beers have steins. My coffee has mugs. My water has bottles. And, my dog has their own damn dishes to eat from...I'll just leave it at that lol
Adult children
So how will you leave when she doesn‚Äôt follow your house rules? (I‚Äôm confused)
Yeah I'm in the same boat. And personally i dont let my dog lick dishes just because its poor training. But she already licks my face incessantly so I'm not too bothered by it. I just think its an odd hill to die on for so many people to be disgusted by haha. I guarantee using a door handle to enter a restaurant and then eating without washing your hands is wayyy germier but many people do it without thinking twice
‚ÄúDo it like grown men watch romantic comedies. Alone and then nevertalk about it‚Äù -   WOW, just wow... talk about masculine insecurity.
Not all children become adults. Some of them do things like let their dogs lick dishes clean, others project their insecurities onto strangers via shitty advice on internet message forums.
Its not confusing. Family learns to live with some things they dont like. You say something if it bothers you and the others take that into consideratation. It get discussed and an agreement that all can work with is reached.   Family first and foremost. I do things they dont like and they tell me about it. I then make some adjustments to what i do and they learn to overlook some things same i do with them.
‚ÄúThoughts and Prayers‚Äù
Yeah I feel like there‚Äôs SO many more disgusting things than using a plate that a dog once licked that has now been washed.   Like, those grub hub and Uber eats drivers that use public restrooms and place their delivery bag on the floor!
I had a feeling that would get a rise out of you.    I was gonna go with masturbation in place of rom com.
Because those two things are relatable for you?
Yeh except the mastubation fails the test because i am not shy about telling anyone i rubbed one out.  Not so much that i bawled watching some chic flick. Some things are better kept to yourself. dogs licking your plates is one of them.
Crying = Dogs licking plates

Inside Duke Hospital as doctors and nurses brace for a surge in Coronavirus patients

they should have interviewed some of the poorer hospitals as well. I  would be interesting to see/know how places like Lumberton are handling this vs larger hospital networks like duke and unc
Here's hoping the surge doesn't happen.
They should stop spending shit load of advertisement dollars on airing freakn susana Maggie and Megan. Spend the useless money on finding a cure for something, you idiots. They air that crap ad multiple times during the day on TV. We all know you do research. But who are you targeting the ads to? Seems worthless spending to me.
My girlfriend's parent works at a hospital in Jacksonville NC is sending covid patients to a hospital far away because they are just handling patients who didn't test positive.

But the shaded area is essentially the margin of error for the prediction, so we‚Äôve got a wide range between not exceeding capacity and dramatically exceeding it - which would mean a spike in the mortality rate.What does this tell us? It tells us **we still have the time and ability** to minimize the loss of life in our state.To be blunt: We are not going to have widespread testing. There are lots of reasons for that - none of which have to do with our state and all of which have to do with the federal response - but it‚Äôs a reality. We‚Äôre still using tests and they're very important, but we're not going to test our way out of this like South Korea did. We just didn't get enough test kits fast enough.But - despite that major setback - it‚Äôs still possible to minimize the loss of life in our state by making sure we don‚Äôt max out the ICU beds. We just have to take social distancing very seriously for the next several weeks. In this model, OUR BEHAVIOR is the biggest variable. How seriously WE take this will ultimately determine the mortality rate.**Quick List*** We‚Äôve only received 17% of the PPE that we requested from the federal government. That‚Äôs not good, and it‚Äôs why we‚Äôre sourcing from everywhere we can find and working with North Carolina manufacturers to switch production to PPE if at all possible.* The state‚Äôs unemployment insurance website and call center are still facing a nightmarish traffic jam as they get slammed with 50x the normal traffic, but we are adding servers and contracted with an additional call center to help field calls. If you‚Äôre having serious trouble, please fill out this customer contact form: [https://des.nc.gov/customer-contact-form](https://des.nc.gov/customer-contact-form).* Regarding the federal unemployment benefit that just passed, it will be administered by the state. We‚Äôre still waiting on implementation guidance from the federal Department of Labor, at which point benefits will be paid in about two weeks. Independent contractors and people who are self-employed will qualify for the federal benefit - they do not currently qualify for the state benefit. I know the state website isn‚Äôt set up to receive applications from people who are contractors or self-employed and that‚Äôs part of what we need to fix. If you fall into this category, just file the application as best you can.* Gov. Cooper‚Äôs new executive order means no one can shut off your electricity, gas, or water for at least the next 60 days.* The U.S. Corps of Engineers is helping us scout for places that could be used as hospital expansions.* We've launched a hotline to help critical workers connect with child care (888-600-1685).STAY STRONG.

Jeff,   You have a beverage of choice? Because holy shit we owe you a few after all of this is done.
You‚Äôve got my vote.  Know this is just as stressful of a time for you as it is for all of us but you‚Äôre doing great.
Best politician in NC right now. Got my votes from here in out.    Thanks again. I like having accurate and timely info from a trusted source.
You're the man.  Thanks for all the great insight and detail again.
This is one republican who will be making sure i vote/donate to your future campaigns if you choose to continue to serve. Thank you sir.
Wow that's a huge margin of error. Hoping for the little peak! Thanks for the info!
You are doing a hell of a job during a really hard time, sir. Keep up the good work!
Senator Jackson, I first want to say that I really appreciate these updates and all you're doing.  My family and I have been social distancing ourselves as much as possible.  However, today we had to go out to drop by car off to get an inspection.  The only reason we've needed to get in the car other than to buy food is to get it inspected.  Registration aside, I can't pay the property tax on it until it's inspected.  Multiple news sources have reported that this is written into the law and cannot change without the General Assembly waiving this requirement.  I understand that with the average person in the assembly being in a very vulnerable age group that there is apprehension about calling a special session.  But consider that there are 4.5 million registered vehicles in the state, which means an average of 375,000 unnecessary interactions per month for the rest of us.
Thank you for the update.  The feds have really been fucking up this whole thing. The media has been saying it's been a "states are pretty much own their own" situation and I didn't want to fully believe it. But now that I hear right from a state senator that it's the truth it makes me have even less faith in the feds.
As best you can? You can‚Äôt complete it or even go past you‚Äôre employer selection. There‚Äôs no options for self employed or gig workers yet. This needs to get fixed for me and the others in this situation. I hope they can do it soon.
Thank you, as always, for such a succinct and honest update on what‚Äôs going on. I find a glimmer of hope in knowing that we still have the time to make a difference in how this all shakes out.
IHME model [here](https://covid19.healthdata.org/projections) (pull down the top menu to see NC data). In the last week that model's baseline prediction has dropped from a peak of 79 deaths/day in mid-April and \~2500 total NC deaths to 50 deaths/day on April 28 and 1597 total deaths.  The people who are going to be dying on April 28 are people who are going to be infected in the next two weeks, so it is still possible to drive that curve down if everyone takes this seriously and acts accordingly.
I would say that in a public health emergency, access to information is incredibly important. Jeff, if possible, I would like for you to have a word with the appropriate party to have telecommunication services (e.g. internet, TV, cellular) be added to the list of services that cannot be shut off for the next 60 days.
Any chance the state will allow unemployment for the self employed?
THANK YOU for getting that des link posted. I have a complicated unemployment question that I need answering and I was getting frustrated trying to call them.  you've been a huge help
It's going to be a damned shame of we don't learn anything from this. I hope our state legislators are going to be working on pandemic response plans at the state level, and plan for a contingency where the federal government still doesn't have it's shit together.   Not trying to be political. I'm simply saying that, regardless of who you want to blame for it, the federal government wasn't prepared for this. I don't think the last admistration would have been any more prepared for *this*. That should be obvious to anyone paying attention. And no matter which side you pull for, we should all have a vested interest in seeing our response get better.   Blame whomever you want, but please, let's learn from this.
Thanks for the efforts. But there are some concerning observations from the front lines like the fact.that nurses are making there own ppe or that testing results are backlogged in somelocation for more then 10+ days. And the fact that they are only testing when users show extreme signs. If we are waiting so long and modifying requirements for testing and tracking the outbreak how can we trust these numbers are remotely close. Or how in some areas there aren't dedicated covid teams which could lead to a nurse or doctor infecting other non covid patients due to lack of ppe. It's great we are trying to pull this together but there are huge holes in this system being implemented that scream we are not ready for the wave that is about to hit in the next few weeks. Someone needs to start offering huge tax insensitive for.companys to rapidly retool. You got 2 weeks! And if you can't do it in the next few weeks be.sure.to order additional freezer trucks. That being said thank you for the efforts thus far.
For what its worth the site you cited has been dropping worse case scenerio for NC since I started watching it a few days ago.  We were at 79 deaths a day by 3rd week of April.  Today it says 51. Let‚Äôs prove them wrong and keep it at 2 a day which is where we have been so far this week yo.   https://covid19.healthdata.org/projections
Does 200+ current hospitalizations = 200+ ICU beds?  I would think that some might be in the hospital but not ICU.   If the current # of ICU beds is actually below 200, isn't the projection graph already off?
It appears that suspending vehicle inspections has to happen in the legislature. Any chance this will happen? I know in the face of everything else this seems petty but it also seems contradictory to the stay at home order.
I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre aware of how bad the situation on the unemployment website is. And if i think you were i think you‚Äôd allocate the effective resources to rectify the problem, now.   I don‚Äôt have money to pay my rent. I‚Äôm missing two weeks of unemployment payments. I‚Äôm in the service industry and I‚Äôve exhausted my funds to pay my bills for the next month assuming that, after filing on 3/18 I‚Äôd have my benefits by now.   This is grossly irresponsible on whoever‚Äôs part it is. Links to finish filing are dead, i filed my weekly certification, the website is saying i didn‚Äôt finish the filing for that week and the page it‚Äôs leading me to finish it is dead. i have three days to file or i miss out on a weeks of payment.
u/JeffJacksonNC  Cause for concern... the current number of positive tests have largely come from contact tracing and since community spread is here, what is the margin of error on this current case count? Furthermore, how much can we trust these projections with this uncertainty.  Lastly, how much more overall quarantine will be required without widespread testing?  Thanks!
Beer store here... please let me give you some beer or wine Jeff.
He deserves a bar named after him
Totally agree that these updates are awesome and very appreciated.
I‚Äôm in on that!
He‚Äôs a not a republican though. You can tell by the way he tries to provide helpful information to people in need instead of shelling out opinions and lies to fatten his bank account.
I probably shouldn't have phrased it like that. It's more like OUR margin of error. It's showing the range of outcomes that will correspond with our range of compliance with social distancing.
Almost like having an anti-intellectual dolt in office since 2017 has had a negative impact on our ability to respond to a crisis. Who would have thought?!
Where you been the last 3 years bruh?
Agreed. I hope Mr. Jackson is paying attention. This is becoming a huge issue for hundreds of thousands of people. Unemployment needs a major overhaul, yesterday.
Yeah, I'm a bit puzzled as to how I'd fill that out. I guess I could use the company that I was contracted with (and got a 1099 from) as my "Employer" and then use the 1099 as the proof, but that doesn't seem like it would process correctly.  Gets even murkier when it comes to shit like the Hourly Rate of Pay and Hours Worked/Week. I worked multiple contracts through that one company, all with different rates and hourly commitments. Do I enter the highest? The lowest?  Guess where you can and hope the processor can make sense of it seems like a recipe for disaster when they're already overburdened with applications.
You need to ask the governor for that, not the NCGA.
I hope so, and I'll certainly support it when we go back into session this month, but it's not at all certain to occur.
Science in general needs to be taken more seriously by both parties and the public in general
I honestly think you should take a few minutes and do some research on our federal response to H1N1, Swine Flu, and Ebola, and compare it to what has happened since the first case of this was detected on our shores in January.  Also, you should notice how one political side is actually sending DEATH THREATS to Dr. Anthony Fauci to the point that he needs a security detail.  I worry that the people who need to learn never will, and the people who could learn already think they know everything. We learned a lot from previous epidemics, but we as a nation decided to vote for people who would throw that learning away and then shrug *who knew*?
yes they would have, trump cut funding for the cdc and dissolved the pandemic response team obama put in place sooooo, we might have
Correct. Hospitalization does not mean ventilator per se. But headed there.
It‚Äôs a very common question. We are going to fix this once we‚Äôre back in session. (I have a personal interest in this because I‚Äôm due, too.)
I spoke with DES today. They have hired an extra 350 people and are adding server capacity. They're getting 1,000 applications per hour. I know it's a mess but we are going to make it work.
Breaking Story on Fox News: NC D Jeff Jackson sponsored by big liquor!
lets get this man a case of something he likes.
I‚Äôm all in on buying something for Sen Jeff! He has gone the real work. Might send him something from crank arm
Who said he was a republican?
Makes sense! C'mon people, let's aim for the little curve!
Any more information on how self employed/gig workers are suppose to finish the process of filing unemployment online? I‚Äôm so confused and loosing money every day as others. I wanna get my claim In the system but can‚Äôt because I am unable to finish the process due to being self employed.
YUP! I'm constantly looking for them to update it. Last night it was down for maintenance, they should have done it then.
Same boat, 1099 guy here. I‚Äôm totally lost as things shift faster than I can keep up.
Thanks Jeff!!  Really appreciate you keeping us informed!
Will the assembly also look at legislature to delay income tax penalties until July 15th?
In the mean time families are without food and rent will go unpaid. I mean this all should have been taken into consideration and rectified before the decision was made not two weeks after. The ball has already been dropped and the damage has been done.
Finally a lobbying group I can get behind!
so just to be clear, we DON'T want to aim high?
The point is to get it in the system and in front of someone's eyes quickly. If they need additional documentation or have additional questions, they'll let you know on the same page where you check the status of your application.
The problem is for self employed people you can‚Äôt complete the process as there‚Äôs so option to choose since you don‚Äôt have a sole employer to choose from on the site.
Huh...the higher I am, the more I want to be on my couch. The ER chairs are the worst.
I get it. Just put down 1 client. In the uploads section, you can put in all you 1099s. Somewhere in the application is a place for you to give an explanation. Within the explanation say that you are self-employed.  Once you submit, someone will review it and probably need to talk/email with you to verify things to approve the application.    The purpose of submitting now is simply to get your name and your application in that queue quickly. Getting everything exactly correct is not; the documentation can be amended later as needed.
Can you explain it more in depth. What do you mean just put down one client?
Whomever you last did a gig/commission/delivery for. I'd say if you're delivering for Postmates put "Postmates." If you're more of a freelancer/contractor, put down the person or organization that last paid you for work.
Or, if you have a personal LLC, you can put that as your employer.
I‚Äôm a musician...... but I fill out W2‚Äôs
Do you have any standing bars/clubs that have you back regularly or more than once a year? Put them down. If not, just put down the last place you were paid to perform.
Thanks yeah I just got through it. Luckly the City has hired me and had an option for musician after completing they started asking me more information on being self employed.

Do you know anyone from North Carolina that's been laid off or unemployed due to the coronavirus? Please invite them to join NC Unemployed

The group "NC Unemployed" that you provided in the post you [deleted](https://old.reddit.com/r/raleigh/comments/fvfny1/if_you_know_anyone_thats_unemployed_please_direct/fmi32cz/) doesn't show up in a facebook search. I'm guessing since clicking the link requires you to be logged in and this is your only post ever, that this is a facebook virus. No thank you.
> Do you know anyone from North Carolina that's been laid off or unemployed due to the coronavirus? Please invite them to join NC Unemployed  Why? What is there that they should join?
Not showing up on FB search either. Weird.
What's your beef man? It's not a virus
It will be group that provides clear information. Right now there is a lot of misinformation that's being passed around regarding unemployment and benefits. It's powers in numbers so it would help if we are all in one place so our voice will be louder.
Then why are you providing a link that requires login to a group name that doesn't exist?      Why did you delete your previous post?
Look man this is a grass roots effort. What are you doing to help the unemployed in NC? Besides bashing and yelling hoax?
You can attack me all you like, but you're only confirming for me that you're not to be trusted.      Why did you give a group name that doesn't exist in facebook search?   Why did you delete your previous post?   Why does the link you provided require you to be logged into facebook?
It definitely exists, and I just joined it no problem. It requires you to be logged into Facebook because it's a Facebook group.
If it exists, why doesn't it show up on facebook search? Facebook groups have an opening page that displays without being required to login. Login is only required to gain access.      For example... here is the [City of Raleigh Politics](https://www.facebook.com/groups/852836921731362) group. It requires a login to join, but no login to see the opening page.
It's called North Carolina Unemployed, not NC Unemployed.
"North Carolina Unemployed" doesn't show up as a result in Facebook search, either.

Your link is requiring a login. Again, the opening page of a group does **NOT** require a login.

So here is a published scientific paper on coronavirus in bats that can be transferred to humans. UNC approves the study. Zhengli-Li Shi Is part of the study, and connected to the Chinese Communist Party... maybe it‚Äôs been on our backyard longer than we thought.

Inb4delete. In the big picture, it changes little in our current situation whether this was an accident at the Wuhan biolab or an evolutionary jump at a wet market a couple miles down the road. Everyone who could clear that up is disappeared by now. I would hope it makes people more questioning of China and their puppets like the WHO, but I am not holding my breath.
It is kind of interesting to see how people jump on that Wuhan BSL-4 lab, while Wuhan is just the only publicly accredited Chinese BSL-4 lab.  It is for sure not their only one. Beside that, work on viruses like the Corona virus "only " requires a BSL-3 lab.   On the other hand - very related viruses have been found in bats and other wildlife.  We know from other events that it is a small jump from these hosts to the human. It only takes one mutation. Viruses mutate al the time. That's why we need a new flu shot every year. Many hosts - many mutations.  And it was expected to happen by most scientists as it happened with SARS and MERS and other in the past. Ebola and other hemorrhagic fevers are likely passed from fruit bats to humans. But yeah - let's jump on the most unlikely reason...
u/JeffJacksonSen any light you can shine on this?
I agree I hope everyone stays healthy regardless of how it emerged. Just a crazy time to live in where we have too much information and no one can discern what is credible and truthful.
Can't remember where I read it, but there was a local Chinese newspaper that ran a story that the virus had been traced to a specific type of bat. That bat doesn't live within 500 miles of Wuhan, nor was it for sale at the Chinese wet market. The bat, however, is one of the regular bats used in the study of bat to human viral transmission. The implication being, the virus entered the human population from a bat in one of the labs.
They found a very similar virus in that bat but it only had 96% of the genome. 96% is not even close to be the same, even if it sounds like it. But the closest they have found so far. Something in the range of 99.8% is needed to be reasonable sure of the source. One current theory is that there was an intermediate host as there are key differences between the bat virus and the human version that are not easy to overcome.   Pangolins are a second possible source. And they come from different countries to Wuhan. That would mean the jump from Bats to Pangolins could have happened in a different country.  Here is a good article from Nature with sources. https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00548-w  Edit: missing words

Resources for business affected by coronavirus
This is an unprecedented time for everyone in North Carolina and with the statewide stay-at-home order, businesses everywhere are struggling to keep their doors open. Here is a list of resources for businesses in North Carolina that may be able to help some business owners. It's a list of loans available, how to file an unemployment insurance claim, new family and medical leave rules, and even how to begin producing PPE to support healthcare workers. With all the uncertainty floating around about the economy and our state, hopefully this list can answer some questions for people and start connecting them to resources that can help.Business Resources: https://edpnc.com/covid-19-resources/

You can‚Äôt even form a proper sentence, yet you‚Äôre intelligent enough to know the truth of why the worldwide economy is being shut down?  Why millions of people have lost their job?    Fuck you.  You and everyone like you are a shitstain on society.

What‚Äôs with the coronavirus defeatism? This disease will pass, things will go back to normal.

I hope not. This is a teachable moment ...I hope we learn from it.   1. I hope we learn to cherish the time we spend with other people.  2. I hope we learn that some jobs we didn't give two cents about before, are more essential than we realized.   3. That we yearn to have worth through work, but also that the reality is, we don't really need to do quite so much of it. The world goes on quite well with workers on a shorter schedules and people working from home and spending more time with family.   4. We made light of this virus by comparing it to the flu, but I hope we learn to start taking the flu more seriously. Too many elderly and immunocompromised are killed by common influenza. I think that during flu season, we should continue to offer some of the services stores have provided during coronavirus. For example, bringing goods to pharmacy window for immunocompromised.   5. It's not weird to wear a face mask to keep people safe.   6. Greenways and sidewalks keep us sane far more than social media.   7. Quieter is better. Fewer planes and cars has made it much quieter. It's been a pleasure to go out and listen to the sounds of birds or to take a nap in the backyard. The vehicles that have been made intentionally louder are unacceptable.   8. We pay A LOT for our medical care. The most in the world. I'm sure there's some way to take a few cents of that to devote to our national security by manufacturing PPE here.   9. Having a pandemic response team in place - even when there isn't an ongoing pandemic is common sense.   10. All these new open floor plans in offices may not have been the best idea. Also, we should do a better job with knowing how to clean highly populated areas.
Oh hell, I can't afford to riot right now.
If there's something I've learned about Doomsday preppers it's that they are typically trash people with a lot of disposable income that are horny for things to collapse. COVID19 will change all of our lives in the long run but society isn't collapsing, but life will be known as pre-COVID19 and post COVID19 for a while now. Much how thigns were different before 9/11 and after 9/11.
Yup. Sometimes I think this should be the official video of this sub:  https://youtu.be/qvPugcb7QGE
I think if our politics keep going down the same road, when that gets met with too many people being stopped from living how they were in February, the tension is going to keep rising. Plus you have these religious cults where they are being encouraged by their leaders to go against law enforcement in the name of the lord, so it's only a matter of time until one of them has the lid pop off.  I don't think it's the end of the world and I do think things will get better. But  if I was a gambler I'd say there will be some scary shit go down if it's July and we are still not anywhere near normal. And with Dr. Fauci saying not to expect schools to reopen till fall at least, the government is not planning to have normal back any time soon.
I don't know which thread are you talking about, but here are some things you need to consider.  No, we won't go back to normal, even with a vaccine, the normal you refer will never be back, expect for the next year or two years, a series of lockdowns because outbreaks, people staying home more often than going out  The world economy has been destroyed, to get back to the level it was before the virus will take years, unemployment will be high for the next couple years, bankruptcies will start soon, the housing market will crash, the banks will stop lending money, a lot of "stimulus" and money from the governments will be needed to stabilize everything before it can start again, there won't be a booming economy as the dumbass president predicts will happen in May 1st, a lot of people will lose their homes, savings, everything...   No, I don't believe there will be riots or a mass collapse, but I can see that tough times are ahead of us and we need to start getting used to a new normal, that will be defined in the next months or years
It‚Äôs depressing. I agree people act like they want to be defeated by this. It‚Äôs rather strange. Where‚Äôs that American resolve?! I‚Äôm in favor of lockdown and social distancing but we also need to be positive and reopen the country eventually. Gotta do it in phases and by region risk and demographic group. I think reasonable reopen is June 1st for businesses/restaurants while maintaining responsible social distance. Then August we open schools/sports/etc by region except for hot zones. But I‚Äôm all for staying positive! We can beat this thing.
What post was the doom and gloom in? Just curious
18 months of near total economic shutdown, both parties giving wall street a $6T slush fun to scour main street, fed reserve bailing out hedge funds and buying junk bonds, small business relief effectively non-existent, severely inadequate worker relief?  This will eventually end, but there's no going back to "normal" after this.
How naive.
Also, on #10: We didn't need this pandemic to realize how stupid open offices are. Open offices are incredibly unpopular, only companies seem to like them for squeezing more people into a smaller building.
‚ÄúVehicle made intentionally louder are unacceptable‚Äù hits home so hard for me. My neighborhood has 3-4 mega loud cars. The speed limit is 25 but people will hit the stop sign then BLAST to like 40 mph real quick and slow back down. It‚Äôs incredibly loud, always, no matter what. 9pm, 8am, back and forth. That pickup truck and blue mustang are killing me.
I hope people stop littering when this is over.
The Flu is the biggest thing that irks me.  Yes, this is worse than normal influenza, because 1) it's novel (no immunity) and 2) even if it's not incredibly deadly to younger people, it's highly contagious with a long period of transmission due to a week or so of low-grade symptoms for a lot of people, which means health systems get slammed all at once.  BUT - influenza is no freaking joke.  Hundreds of thousands die every single year worldwide from the flu.  While I don't think we should be shutting everything down every winter, we can tell by our collective hygiene before Covid hit that we really don't take the flu seriously.  We could significantly reduce flu deaths by normalizing social distancing, face masks, and hand washing throughout the winter months.
>I hope not.   This was my first thought seeing this post in my feed.
Open floor plans are great. A virus will penetrate your cubicles, I assure you.
I feel this. The problem is gonna be how we can tell if we can afford not to!
Alright man... I‚Äôm going to have to ask you to take a breath, unclutch your pearls, and slowly back away from the internet for a while.
We've survived recessions before, my dude. We're not even as bad off as 2008 at this point. Hell, technically, we're not even in a recession yet.
This is a new world now. If banks and landlords think people are just going to go "aw shucks" with the old ways of collecting when people literally cannot get a job then they are in for a very rude awakening. If 60% of your tenants in your building can't pay what is going to happen when they all say "just try to evict all of us". If a family of four is going to lose their house because their are simply no jobs eventually they are going to say, "come and take it".  There aren't enough sheriffs to evict 30% of the population and even if there suddenly were, do you think they would do the bidding of landlords and banks against an angry and armed populous?   Don't even get me started on the millions of Americans that are going to get medical bills from this pandemic and go "yeah I'm not paying that, go to hell".
Fear porn at its finest. This subreddit is cancer.
Well said.
you can only do regions if you limit domestic travel. otheerwise its pointless.
For everyone hoping the coronavirus will go away already
Who said we are shutting down for 18 months?  From the now-debunked first-report model by Imperial College of London?  That was one scenario.  The other scenario, which is just as likely, is that we have peaked, or almost peaked in cases already, that transmission will decline to R0 <1 by mid-late may, and that there will be no second wave.  The 18 month prediction is no more evidence-based than the optimistic scenario.  Actually less, because we are already seeing hospitalizations decline in hard-hit areas and deaths not anywhere near where they were supposed to be by now.
Who cares about normal anymore? Just get through this without loved ones dying. Maybe people care less about getting a new car or fancy coffee and that‚Äôs the new normal.
Amen! I‚Äôve been saying this for years that the only people who like open office are those who either have a private office or WFH most of the time or are those who make it worse for everyone else. No one sincerely enjoys being in an open office full time.   And on top of that, any disease spreads there like wild fire. In my last job, our team was in a separate room for security reasons. Guess who was not sick when the rest of the office was coughing and sneezing.
This is all over raleigh. I'm about a mile or two from Capital blvd and it just sounds like cars backfiring all day. Legit thought someone was shooting a rifle last night but it was just a shitty muffler, probably on a honda civic.
Are you in Wake Forest by chance?  Side note - the new Mustangs are pretty loud all on their own. It doesn't take any modification, really, to make them ridiculous.
I've been on calls where these same vehicles drive by and people think I'm on the road. Nope. In my house with the windows up.   These vehicles are loud enough to cause hearing damage. If it's just a one off, maybe not, but there are more and more of these hearing damaging vehicles for no good reason. In other countries these very same models make 60% less noise. It's ridiculous.
I'm sure we've all heard this argument out there that "we shouldn't care about this because it's basically like the Flu, just we don't have a vaccine". And it's like, you realize what a big deal the Flu was before we had a vaccine, right?
Yeah this is what's shocked me. "It's like the flu" well yes, it is, but like.. the flu kills people too. Wear a damn mask if you're coughing up a lung or stay home. I'm not a proponent of long term shutdowns but I've always been disgusted by how Americans get sick and just go out with no masks on sneezing all over each other. If anything, this should be the time we learn to be mindful of others no matter what the disease is.
I had the flu in February and it was the worst I‚Äôve ever felt
The flu isn't a joke but if you have the flu you can infect one to two people, with COVID it can be up as many as 15 people. The conservative agenda downpaying this as just a bad flu got people killed because they tried to down play it.
>Open floor plans are great.  This may be the first time I've ever read this anywhere.
https://www.wsj.com/articles/your-open-floor-collaborative-office-could-help-spread-coronavirus-11583784275  Simple logic should tell you that if a grocery store is paying money to install a plexiglass shield to protect their cashier from their customers, a much more substantial box around an employee is much more effective.
I needed to read this today. Thank you.
Which part am I wrong?
We are in a recession, just last week 16 million people applied for unemployment, 6 more than previous week, and those are just the ones that can apply for it, the numbers are higher. Plus jobs not created in the past months. Just to give you an idea... December 2008, 11.1 million unemployed (official numbers), here's the [source](https://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2009/jan/wk2/art02.htm?view_full), April 2020, 16.7 million ([source](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/09/business/economy/unemployment-claim-numbers-coronavirus.html)), are we better??  A 2.2 trillion "stimulus" is not a recession?, then what is it? also another 2.3 trillion from the Fed in the upcoming weeks... plus 250 billion being discussed today in Congress... what do you call that then? the government being nice? the Fed setting the interest rate to 0%, the market crashing losing trillions of dollars in value, yes, yes, the stock market doesn't determine the economy, but it gives you an idea of how companies will behave, companies starting to consider or already in bankruptcy talsk... if this is not a recession, then explain to me what do you call this  So you think that on May 1st we will just go back to normal? the virus is going to disappear magically, like the dumbass president said... we are going to wake up and like nothing
That is because the fed is pumping money into the economy.
Between this and "everyone is doing quarantine wrong but me" posts everyday this subreddit is exhausting.
lol @ downvote for providing the thread title
JP Morgan, a super conservative financial institution, warned investors that society will be on rolling lock downs until at least spring 2021.  No one said total lockdown for 18 months. But are the effects of one month off to cull an acceptable number of people, two months down, all travel between regions locked down, etc. any more tolerable to an economy that can't handle a few days of shut down?  Also [prepublish in lancet](https://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lancet/PIIS0140-6736\(20\)30746-7.pdf) indicates R‚ÇÄ approaching 5.5, no seasonal dip, and no return to normal society until there's a vaccine.  You also have a fundamental misunderstanding of death peaks: THIS cycle is peaking. This is the first of many cycles, since we can't eradicate the virus loosening of social restrictions will be done until the death rate exceeds a set limit and then we'll shut down again and wait for it to quiet. Repeat over and over...
There will definitely be a second wave. But yes I agree 18 months full lock down is ridiculous. We are looking at maybe 2-3 lockdowns over the next year but not permanent.
I'm in North Raleigh. I've lived here for over a decade. It's much louder now. These vehicles will literally hurt your ears when they drive by. Meanwhile Raleigh PD have given only 10 tickets for faulty exhaust for the past 3 years.
I am in Youngsville on Holden Road, and I told my husband that I wanted to throw nails in the road for all the dipshit young "men" in annoying loud-ass squatted trucks.  Fuck all those guys.
North raleigh on Creedmoor side
Up until the outbreak I had been saving thousands for new windows for my house to combat the noise. I'm over a half mile from Glenwood with tall trees and houses in between and I hear loud exhaust all day every day despite this. I can't hear the normal "whoosh" of the road but I certainly hear the "BRRRRRR" constantly. There must be thousands of intentionally loud vehicles in this metro.  Granted, with the pandemic things have been much quieter but I still hear loud exhaust, even as I'm typing this. People treat that road like a drag strip.
Same. I‚Äôm inside with windows closed and I have to mute my microphone. It sounds like I‚Äôm on the road next to them. I wish I were exaggerating
It's still a big deal even with a vaccine. Since the flu strain changes every year, vaccine effectiveness can vary dramatically. Sometimes the vaccine is only like 40% effective.
Dude, what? You can infect a LOT of people with the flu. If you're a young, healthy person working a customer-facing job, traveling, going to a concert/convention, teaching or attending school, working at an airport, so on and so forth you can infect hundreds with the flu. I've attended a concert with a large group and we ALL caught the flu from one person there.
You think that companies are increasingly moving toward floor plans because everyone hates them, in order to drive their employees away, then?
Right but that's for people that pass by for 30 seconds, NOT for people you sit in a room with for 8 hours that will still stop by your cubicle, touch the same doors/silverware/etc you touch, so on and so forth.  Open floor plans are simply more productive. If you want to install glass shields around you in your open floor plan I doubt it'd be an issue, but people like to see each other and have conversations.  As for the article you linked, I cannot identify a MSM news source that hasn't posted misleading headlines and clickbait in the past day even. If you ever take a moment to look into the real science/reports/stats they're citing, you'll realize the headlines are designed to promote fear/anxiety because that means more clicks and more money. Stop reading MSM and start looking at the science coming out.
Recession has a definition. You can't just declare recession like Micheal Scott declared bankruptcy. A recession occurs any time you have two consecutive quarters of negative Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth.
the only part of your comment that had any merit was the housing market thing. which will recover as soon as we reopen things...
Which part?  I‚Äôd say your entire pathetic screed.  Fear mongering isn‚Äôt helpful and baseless fear mongering is pants-on-head retarded.  Your premise seems to stem from irrational fear and while there is a large and obvious avenue for caution in our actions the world will return to normal.  Either through effective quarantine, a vaccine, or herd immunity.  And this will happen faster than you‚Äôd think.  Edit:  *Not happening* faster than you‚Äôd think is kind of the whole point of the SAH order.
A recession is 2 consecutive quarters of economic decline, which is why I said "technically". So no, we are not in a recession because there has not been 2 consecutive quarters of economic decline.
As a previous poster said, there is an actual meaning behind what "recession" is.  https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/recession.asp
It doesn't matter if you believe the virus is going to magically disappear on May 1 or not; we either re-open the economy in the next few weeks or we begin economic and societal collapse. We must learn to function in this new environment.
Banks and landlords definitely have no qualms evicting people. But banks and landlords have no power to evict people en masse. The fed estimated that there will be 32% unemployment:  https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/30/coronavirus-job-losses-could-total-47-million-unemployment-rate-of-32percent-fed-says.html  This is not about being compassionate, it's about millions of people saying "go fuck yourself" when faceless banks try to make them homeless all at the same time. These numbers dwarf 2008 already and with forbearance the bills for millions will be due at the exact same time. You simply don't have the police power to evict millions, nor will most police forces even attempt to try.   This is not the same United States of 3 months ago. The only reason these systems have any power is because people give it to them. If 32% of the population suddenly can't give them power then guess what? They have no power.
IKR? I'm ready for people to get back at bitching about people not using their blinkers, not turning their lights on in the rain, and how The Pit is overrated.
Much of this is evolving social mores and norms. While I think it can be helpful to throw some ideas into social media, it can be even more helpful to get out there and emulate the behavior as the posted episode of Brain Games shows.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8BkzvP19v4
Pretty much all of reddit is toxic at this point. I just tend to avoid most subs unless they related to a hobby. At least those aren't filled with political or virus related crap.
>I have a feeling it will be hard to get the people to agree with multiple lockdowns.
It is already estimated at R0 = 1 or below currently in Italy.  Check worldometers.info, Italy page for more info.  Below 1 and it fades out.  This happened with SARS, and it will happen with this.  JP Morgan do not have a crystal ball.  They are hoping investors will price in the risk.
I mean... it may not actually be faulty. It may be a fully functional exhaust system.
UGH the "Carolina squat" trucks are fucking cancer. They're absolutely ridiculous. Their fucking headlights point at the damn sky, along with their windshields... how the hell do they SEE??
Gotcha. I happen to know a guy in WF with a blue mustang and a truck. Though I don't think the truck is super loud.
The RO number of the flu is exponentially lower (around 1.3) than that of COVID19 which is up around (5-12 - possibly higher). The flu is bad but not nearly as contagious as COVID19.
No, it's because they're cheap.
Recessions are normal.  As are recoveries.  The expectation of a recession doesn't lend weight to your prediction that "the normal you refer will never be back."
https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/10/business/united-states-recession/index.html
There‚Äôs no official definition of a recession, it depends who you ask. The NBER, which is the organization that officially ‚Äúdeclares‚Äù recessions in the US, states: The NBER does not define a recession in terms of two consecutive quarters of decline in real GDP. Rather, a recession is a significant decline in economic activity spread across the economy, lasting more than a few months, normally visible in real GDP, real income, employment, industrial production, and wholesale-retail sales.
sure, don't forget your tin foil hat, CIA reading your mind... hopefully you're ready for the rude awakening of your non-existent recession
Once we see that there are 2 consecutive quarters of GDP decline, then we _will have been_ in a recession from the beginning of the decline.  We almost certainly are in a recession now.  We don't have final numbers for Q1, but the consensus estimate is around -4%.  Estimates for Q2 range from -10% to -25%.  So all the analysts would have to be wildly, incomprehensibly wrong for the official results to turn out to be positive for either quarter.
I accept that using the term recession is incorrect of my part when we're just heading for the first quarter results, but I still will say that things won't go back to normal, there won't be a sudden boom on the economy that will bring everything back to what it was on May 1st (or the 5th, whenever is decided to start allowing things to back to normal).
Technocratic squabbling over definitions is super useful right now.
Maintain social distance, require everyone to wear masks in public, and isolate the elderly.  Or not.  But either way, things have to start opening up again - even if we end up like 1918 in terms of deaths (which I believe is almost a 0 percent chance of happening - the 1918 flu disproportionately killed working-age adults).
Well, hopefully everyone is right and I'm wrong and things magically go back to normal in 17 days... if that's the case, I'll buy everyone beer at the Beer Garden as soon as they open... shoot me a DM
Lets pretend we reopen things on may first because we cant risk more economic damge ( i would like to know how many need to be dead everyday to declare it not worth it in the first place, a number would be nice) does the economy do better by opening and having shit tons of deaths and shutting back down for 3 weeks or  30-45 days later as the death rate starts to skyrocket again in some places?    I think its best to keep it closed down until we really understand whats gonna happen and can test. open, closed, open, close, open again is gonna do waay more damage than just staying shut down for 45 or 60 or 90 days if thats what it takes.   Sucks for those with no savings. go complain to your parents you are broke and hungry for not teaching you to have a 6 month emergency fund in the bank or look in the mirror and be mad at that person looking back at you that ignored that advice.
With the olive garden closed what did you expect to happen to this sub?
Then we will get mass death, three million plus in a six week period, bodies rotting in homes and on the street.
Italy is still under shutdown. That is the only reason that Rt (not R0) has declined.
Flu's R0 these days is based on the population having partial immunity to all strains. I also never said R0 wasn't higher, I was contesting your claim where you compared R0 (average number infected) for flu with highest possible number of people you can infect with COVID. That's not a legitimate comparison.
That in no way explains why companies that already have cubicles set up would intentionally remove them.
That's like linking me an article that says 45 sports writers say Panthers already won 2021 Superbowl. It's the market, opinions don't matter.   I think we're headed for a recession but we haven't met the definition yet.
Lol.  Ok man.  You have a nice day.
I don't think we'll be back to pre-covid economic strength, but it will certainly start growing again once restrictions are lifted. That's the big difference between what's going on now and what happens under a normal market-directed recession: This downturn was caused by a pandemic and the governmental restrictions that followed it, not by a normal economic shift.   Consumer spending is expected to continue throughout the rest of this quarter. The National Association for Business Economics is forcasting growth to turn positive in the later half of this quarter, with an increase of 2% in the third quarter and 5.8% in the fourth quarter.  So, we're really looking at a 6 month recession, which is just about the bare minimum required for the downturn to even be considered a recession. Heck, just look at the  Great Recession (2007-2009) which officially lasted 19 months and its effects were felt for much longer. Yeah, it was terrible for a lot of people, but we survived it. This isn't going to be half as bad as that. We'll come out of this okay as well.
Well, if we're going to starting worrying about stuff, it's helpful to actually be correct in what to worry about. That said, I'm also not too happy with what's going on wrt printing up all this money and whatnot, but that's another thread.  (at any rate, it's not like we have anything better to do while stuck at home)
I agree. We take full precautions and continue to develop best procedures.      This virus isn't going away anytime soon.
We cannot choose one or the other. We will be facing economic and societal collapse. Supply chains are already breaking down. Once supply chains break down, they take months to years to reestablish depending on the product. This includes food. Your imaginary 6 month savings that 75% of the population doesn't have, will not be enough for even those that have it if you allow the supply chains to collapse. You can't shutdown an economy and not expect catastrophic results.
So the fed anticipates 32% unemployment and I'm the one fear mongering? Here are the facts:  - [The $1200 dollar stimulus will get you 1 month of rent on average in Raleigh](https://www.rentjungle.com/average-rent-in-raleigh-rent-trends/) - The federal unemployment benefits are administered by the states. [Only 10% of people who apply for unemployment benefits in this state quality for unemployment](https://old.reddit.com/r/raleigh/comments/fpzfqv/heres_the_situation_with_unemployment_insurance/) - Median income does not matter when [one tenth of the workforce is unemployed right now and rising](https://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/article241916341.html)  But sure, keep your normalcy bias going. Everything is just going to be fine when landlords and banks plan [a massive wave of evictions](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2020/04/08/eviction-coronavirus-rent-homelessness/). We'll be back to normal drinking 7 dollar IPAs any day now!
If the cook outs go they'll burn this state to the ground.
Wait, are they really closed? Not even to-go orders? If that's the case and I can't get the best bread sticks in town, the doomsdayers might be right!
The Imperial College model has since been debunked with new data from China, Iceland, Italy and Spain. New IFR is estimated at about 0.6% with about 80% population immunity needed for herd immunity. That gives you 1 million total. Where's your 3M in 6 weeks coming from?
Look at everything happening right now, flu is clearly not as contagious as COVID. It's just not. Flu does not hang around like COVID, it doesn't get transmitted via fecal matter,  among the many ways that COVID is. I right there with you that too many people on a yearly basis die from the flu - but COVID is more contagious and looks like it's more dangerous in the long term too.
Anecdotally, my company switched to an open floor plan and put in twice as many people. Everyone fucking hated it and it was so awkward because nobody had any privacy. Everyone I talked to thought the atmosphere was super tense.
Since the definition can only look backwards to a fiscal quarter once it's ended, and the common definition is "two quarters in a row with X growth", any time a recession *starts*, we are technically *in* that recession for two quarters before we can *officially* call it that.  But here we are.... with 2020Q1 meeting the definition, and the first month of Q2 meeting the definition by an order of magnitude.  Do you realistically think that May and June are going to bounce back so much that they're going to completely counteract the losses of just the first half of April?  If you're going for a football reference, it would be more like predicting that Atlanta is going to beat the Patriots in the Superbowl, up 28-3 with less than 3 minutes left in the third quarter.
I hope you're right and I'm wrong, I'll very cautious to say we will be back to normal, I see the numbers out there and things don't look good short term. Yes, we will survive, not my first rodeo
A recession is a recession, but maybe not a Recession. Who cares? We know there's nearly 30% unemployment now (raw number will soon exceed the Great Depression), the stock market slid dramatically, etc. It will be declared a Recession in month, but we're in a recession now.
its not imiginary.  its very old, teested and true and standard finanacial advice.  Again not my problem so many ignored it.  I can eat a long time on some very basic items and what i can grow in the garden. Ill buy a ficking goat and a few chickens if i need to in order to get by.   Supply chains are gonna be worse than they are if they start trying to open to much at all any time soon without decent testing for the virus, antibody testing, and knowing about how long would be immune.   You think it tough now?  wait 3 months when we get to do it again, longer, with police actully enforcing it.  Cause thats whats gonna happen if its rushed.
This doesn‚Äôt really sound like a system that we should be excited to go back to.
330M \* 0.8 = 264M infections. 264M \* 0.006 = 1.584M dead.  The ICL model wasn't debunked; that was the "do nothing" prediction. We didn't "do nothing", we shut down.  IFR = 0.6% assumes that the sickest can get hospital treatment. If 200+M catch this within a couple of months, the hospitals will be blown out.  And BTW, latest IFR estimates are 0.38% (Germany).
Dude nobody is catching COVID from rim jobs.  You're 100% incorrect about how flu doesn't "hang around" - influenza particles stay in the air/on objects for hours. You just don't see as many severe illnesses because pretty much everyone already has partial immunity to every influenza strain. If the flu was novel, it would look exactly like this. Which would be bad.
That blows :( I think packing more people in defeats the purpose. My office is open plan but everyone has plenty of personal space, and there are phone booths for meetings etc. We also all get along, so I guess if you hate your coworkers it would suck..
I think people are being harsh with your comments because you're frustrated and anxious, and I totally get it. In a way, you are right- we *won't* be back to where we were before the virus hit. But look at *where* we were before they virus hit: Economy was booming. Unemployment at record lows. Stock market at record highs. So yeah, we're not going to be back there by the end of this year. *But the economy will start growing again quickly*. That's the silver lining in all this. The economy isn't going to be slugish like it was after 2008. It's going to come back *almost* as quickly as it declined. A deep, short recession is much less impact in the long term than a long moderate recession.
And when it is actually a recession, it'll be as such. 'Til then... keep an eye on GDP.
Great... you focus on that 6 months savings that 75% of the population doesn't have. They've been living paycheck to paycheck, and now there's no paychecks. You go ahead and grow your garden. Meanwhile, the rest of the people will start the economy back up so we don't devolve into a third world nation. That is what people like you are calling for with government bans and authoritarian enforcement. Most of us would prefer we don't give into overreactions and panic. Most of us would prefer to remain a free country.
I've posted 5 sources and you have posted zero, if anything the sentiment of "nothing will change" is more based on feelings than anything else. The fact that you think not much changed after world wars, civil wars, economic crashes, terrorists attacks and multiple pandemics is quite frankly blatantly false.   Also for the record I'm not trying to attack you or your ideas. If anything I hope you and everyone in this thread stays happy, healthy, and safe. We just got some very very real challenges ahead and I am trying my best to balance "everything is going to totally fine" and "prepare for civil unrest" because the truth will be somewhere in the middle.
I heard 0.66, is it really 0.38? That's fantastic.
Multiple people have caught COVID19 from fecal exposure. A notable case in China had a large swath of an apartment building catching it from a broken sewage pipe leaking into the water supply.  I think you need to check your COVID information versus influenza.
It just doesn‚Äôt make any sense for my business to have an open floor plan. We are a global business so you may have 1 or 2 people in the building that is actually on your team, otherwise you‚Äôre on the phone or Skype all day. I personally didn‚Äôt work on the same team with anyone in that building. We didn‚Äôt hate each other, we just didn‚Äôt know each other bc nobody actually worked together.
How will that happen with all of the small businesses, restaurants, etc. that are never going to open again?  The airlines aren't going to recover either.  There's a lot of people that lost jobs that won't come back because everyone panicked due to crappy models.  Lives have been destroyed due to overreaction and since we let the government do it this time we're going to let them do it again.  Everyone should be quarantined in their homes between October and March from now on to prevent the spread of anything.
Are you a big fan of the West Wing by any chance?
>  Most of us would prefer we don't give into overreactions and panic  Thats rich coming from the person who wrote " We will be facing economic and societal collapse." and "or we begin economic and societal collapse. We must learn to function in this new environment."  Yoou are right about We must learn to function in this new environment.  That new enviroment is gonna be most of the economy shut down until late may and maybe until july with some places trying to get back to bussiness then but with rolling shutdowns as needed. Thats the enviroment you need to be able to function in now.
womp womp.
> How will that happen with all of the small businesses, restaurants, etc. that are never going to open again?  As long as the consumers are still spending, they'll absolutely open again, or new ones will take their place. That's why stimulus spending works. It slows the downward spiral so we don't bottom out.
Haven't watched it
What do you think happens when supply chains break down? This isn't an extended spring break. We don't just pick up where we left off when the government says the coast is clear. Nevermind the virus will be waiting to infect us again when we come out, an existing economy won't be because we'll have shut it all down. This virus isn't going away. The only thing you're advocating for is to make the economy go away.    The environment we need to function in is one where we deal with both the virus AND lift mandatory shutdowns. We cannot choose to do one or the other without catastrophic results. You are in denial if you think otherwise.
Consumers can't spend if they've lost their jobs and have no money.  The "stimulus" isn't going to be enough.
You sound like somone who might be up to his neck in house and car and toy payments and no savings.  if you are unemployed because of this you are gonna be fine for the next month and prolly beyond that when the next set of checks prolly get sent out. Worry when congress decides they aint sendiing out any more checks to keep folks at least able to eat and make regular rent or mortage payments.  Me and my wife are getting checks, two 1200 checks, you are to i bet. so is my kid and her husband and they are getting 500 more because of a kid. It will be done again in may if they cant get things under controll and up and running.   Dont panic!   I may not really be feeling it in the pocketbook ( because i saved for times like   this) with this whole thing but i got other issues with it. I got my 17 month old grandson full time with me and my wife while his mother and father are locked down 5 hours way on active duty in the army,  they cant even come visit and we cant risk going to them because at least she is still having to go into work and deal with people on occasion.  So i am feeling it. My kid and her kid feel it. You think i wanted to be full time raising a 17 month old grandson with no payground, no marbles, no play dates?  No, love the kid but I want it over also. I want it over when the drs say it should be over not the money folks want it over.
You sure about that? Let's run a scenario real quick:  Family of 4. Dual income <$150k. 2 dependent kids. One spouse loses their job due to COVID. Here is what they get:  - $1,200 for adult 1 - $1,200 for adult 2 - $500 for child 1 - $500 for child 2 - $600 federal UI per week for unemployed spouse - $1-600 state UI per week (dependent on state and income) for unemployed spouse  So, in month 1, that's a total of $5,801 - $8,200 in non work related income this family will be receiving, and they will receive $2,400 - $4,800 every consecutive month after. And one family member still has their job and normal income! You don't think that's a lot?
I'm fine. I'm fine for at least the magical 6 months you talk about. But really, what does that have to do with anything I've said? Do you not care about those that are in that situation? Do you not care that supply chains collapsing will cripple our economy?    Again... 75% of the population doesn't have the savings. The government moves at a snails pace, nevermind free money without productivity is a recipe for hyperinflation. Supply chains are already starting to break down.    People who want to keep the economy shuddered are the ones panicking. They want to resort to heavy handed authoritarian tactics to fight something that can't be fought that way. The virus isn't going away. The idea that you can shut down an entire economy for months on end and not have catastrophic results, is plain ludicrous. We can't make it a choice of fighting the virus or re-opening our economy. We must do both. It is the only logical solution. We choose just one, then we are royally f'd.     Listen to your doctor. Stay in the house. Grow your garden. Nobody is forcing you to engage when the economy starts back up. But starting it back up is exactly what we need to do.
Take out, rent, mortgage, utilities, vehicle expenses, etc.  Not only that but you can fail to qualify for unemployment if a spouse is working and makes above a certain threshold, and/or uneployment payments can be severely reduced.  Besides, most people are going to save their initial Covid payment because apparently we're doing this Social Distancing/lockdown/economic destruction until 2022.

Coronavirus truthers stage protest in downtown Raleigh, one arrested

I read some of the statements they made and couldn't believe how stupid and selfish they were. It was like hearing an antivaxer on steroids. "Everyone should be able to do what they want. I'm not afraid!" You're not only putting yourself at risk, but you're putting my family and me and risk too. That's why they had to make it an order, because people are too dumb to make the smart choice.

INDY Week is such garbage.
Appropriate headline title though.

Coronavirus NC: Wake County extends stay-at-home order through April 30

Isn't the entire state already under a stay-at-home order through April 30?
I‚Äôm not surprised, the Governor‚Äôs executive order takes precedence over Wake‚Äôs except for the parts for Wake that are more stringent.
Lol...Doesn‚Äôt surprise me that you can‚Äôt put together a coherent sentence. You‚Äôre only capable of hate and death threats. When you turn 18 and understand your rights, maybe you‚Äôll change.
These executive orders don‚Äôt override our Bill of Rights which says we do have the right to peacefully assemble. Our rights are under attack. Don‚Äôt stand for it.
Yes, [through the 29th](https://www.ncdhhs.gov/news/press-releases/governor-cooper-announces-statewide-stay-home-order-until-april-29) state-wide. A couple of differences include special protocols for retail businesses to open up if they provide curbside or delivery services and how faith organizations should handle their 'drive-through' services.
lol yeah you do that. Call all your friends. Go out and protest.   When you catch Covid please have the decency to die at home. You don‚Äôt deserve a place in our hospitals if you‚Äôre going to behave recklessly.
The bill of rights does not allow you to put the public at risk of death.

Petition for Outer Banks nude beach circles internet in wake of coronavirus

Where are all the protests about this? And by protests I mean for, not against. I wanna see some old man balls.
DM sent.
Nude beaches sound awesome until you get there, then it‚Äôs nothing but balls hanging down to kneecaps!

Leader of North Carolina protests against stay-at-home tests positive for coronavirus


Triangle Could Become A New National Coronavirus Hotspot

The good (well... sort of good in a crappy way) news is that a lot of these deaths are from outbreaks at nursing homes, not the general population.
When testing is so shit across the nation I don't put much stock in what the next hot spot is. If you look at worldwide trends the virus impacts densely populated areas the hardest and the Triangle is not densely populated whatsoever.
When the total number of deaths is low, any increase causes a high growth rate.      Durham County has 16 total deaths. Orange County has 14 total deaths.
Sad to see this. I thought we were doing better than most of other bigger cities.  And considering NC is still under ‚Äòstay at home‚Äô, I hope it doesn‚Äôt come true!
We are doing significantly better if you look at number of cases and deaths in NC versus pretty much everyone else on that list. But their indication of 43% growth rate in Durham/chapel hill isn‚Äôt good. it‚Äôs only based on the last two weeks of data we also have to keep in mind.
This is a garbage article. They're using garbage metrics and it's being spread to create fear, uncertainty, and doubt to generate advertising revenue. Shame.
Don‚Äôt love this at all. Please stay home everyone
That‚Äôs deaths of patients with positive tests. A better metric is year over year change in fatality and serious hospitalizations.
technically we are doing better than bigger cities. I can't read that\^ article above due to paywalls/subscriptions. But I have to visit our hospitals weekly and the environment does not reflect what is being reported else ware. There are cases, but its not nearly as dire as they portray.
>North Carolina has done really well. New York (state) has about twice our population, but 40x more deaths than us. Georgia has a slightly larger population than NC, but has 3x as many deaths as NC. Ohio (similar population) has twice as many deaths as us. Michigan (similar population) has almost 12x the deaths.
I did too
Our testing numbers are really low, you can't judge our total cases against anything at the moment.     The only real indicator that's worth anything at the moment is deaths but even then is lagging because many more are infected and  have no idea.
I'm just going by the sourced material used in the article from the New York Times. Apples and apples.
Oh for sure was just referencing what that article said. I don‚Äôt understand why Widespread testing still isn‚Äôt happening and not too sure they‚Äôre going to have that figured out anytime soon.

Alright Corona Virus, Sir Nibbler is officially tired of your shit.

Anonypuss
What does he look like without the Guy Fawkes mask?
An ancient and powerful race indeed. I assume he was named because he is expected to live long and is a celebrated pooper?
r/meowstache
Very cool looking kitty - love the black, black, black on the mouth.  My 6 feral kitties out here at 3,600 feet in Madison County don't know anything about coronavirus - cause nothing has changed out here - 2 of them I've still never touch - but they dig living here.  Peace

The fact this cats not named Pierre is a crime
He's a fancy french puss.
That is the most sophisticated cat I‚Äôve ever seen
Sir Nibbler having a face on his face is a flex.

Any Corona virus Lasik promo's
I got an email recently from a rather well known orthodontist in the area offering 1k off of Invisalign if you set up an appointment for after things open back up. Has anyone seen anything similar for Lasik?
> a rather well known orthodontist in the area offering 1k off of Invisalign  Which one?
Love Gladwell!
Is gladwell well respected in the area? I‚Äôm looking for Invisalign and my dentist sent me to Nay & associates
Gladwell
He has definitely made a name for himself and no doubt he can do things with Invisalign that no one else can. He does come across as very arrogant but maybe he's earned it.      Not that it is super relevant but he was kicked out of a basketball game once  [https://twitter.com/countessesofunc/status/962467310769459200?lang=en](https://twitter.com/countessesofunc/status/962467310769459200?lang=en)
I almost like him more now
