Harris Teeter takes steps to limit customer capacity in response to COVID-19

Good. Because up until now the HT on Cloverdale hasn’t done shit other than remove baskets and put a disinfectant wipe station at ONE of their entrances. No 6-foot tape, no plexiglass, nothing covering the terminal keypad.
Smart
I think most places are now. I was at target, they were allowing 380 people in at a time... Seems a bit high
ya,  even dollar tree took measures.    Do they really want to be compared to the Dollar Tree?   Just saying....

I actually really appreciate this list. Too bad I live in a different part of winston. Either way, this list makes it clear that I won't be going to Harris Teeter any time soon.
All I know is stay away from the Food Lion in Walkertown.     The lady who was checking us out kept STICKING HER HANDS UP INSIDE HER FACEMASK TO LICK HER FINGERS! I couldn't believe it, and when my husband said something to her she acted like we shit in her corn flakes and said "I just washed them a minute ago!" I honestly can't believe how stupid people are. She also got an attitude when we refused to take our receipt from her nasty hand, and she threw it in the trash with a huff.
My last two visits to Whole Foods included an employee at the front entrance allowing someone in only when someone came out. I think you should reconsider the "X" you gave them on "Enforcement of maximum capacity".
The Harris Teeter on Reynolda near Old Town is doing much better. The only things they are not doing is designated enter/exit and one way aisles.
There is a Food Lion in Winston that had two employees test positive. They did not tell the other employees or close the store to clean until a week after. I lost some vendors due to this. They are pissed that they found two weeks after and now they are staying home for two weeks. Little late for that now though.
Interesting and useful article.  I'm surprised that Publix gets a check mark for employees wearing protective face coverings.  This was not the case 2 days ago (I believe I saw one employee in the entire store with a mask out of maybe 20).
Not sure if it was just a weird shift but I just got back from Food Lion and none of the employees had face masks or gloves on.
 Yup.  [Three employees at Harris Teeter's Greensboro distribution center test positive for COVID-19] (https://www.bizjournals.com/triad/news/2020/04/17/three-employees-at-harris-teeters-greensboro.html?iana=hpmvp_triad_news_headline?ana=e_triad_bn_breakingnews_breakingnews&j=90504491&t=Breaking%20News&mkt_tok=eyJpIjoiT0dNeVlXVXlPRE16WWprdyIsInQiOiI3SVVjYUszRFJZNGpYVGFtY0gycHpYY1JHTmRHRFhNN0dZT1JaRVhaOEVteU5jWVU2UVNCenV0MzVoOHl3TFlaK2s1XC9CWHkxSFlBU2d6ZzE0XC9XcFNSYWtYWnFxbUhYQVl0RlErcENURTIwbVFJRnBVT1VrY28wWkRWUnhIcEtGaWVCZERnQ2EwR1oxRFRZY0lHS3Nidz09In0%3D)
Yo this was super helpful thank you
Excellent idea
Food lion(multiple stores) placement of "one way" signs is horrible, they are on the shelves but hardly noticeable. they should be on the floors.
Thanks for this. HT on Cloverdale was a ghost town this AM. Made it super easy to shop and get everything we needed.
To be fair my local HT of Reynolda just 3 days ago was offering hand sanitizer and gloves as soon as you entered.
Oh.   Oh no.
I have a co worker who refused to cover their face when coughing, told me they are a "grown-ass person and can do what they want" They've been out of work now for 2 weeks...
That's good to know. That place is massive.
That was a nice surprise when I was there last.
That's something that needs to happen IMO, but whatever HT does has to be approved by Kroger since they own the company.
Why has nothing about this been reported by news outlets? One Trader Joe's in my hometown has closed twice since having 2 employees test positive for COVID-19.
Which store please?
When we visited it was about 50/50 with and without masks. The gentleman sanitizing the carts had one as did some stock people and cashiers.
I had been completely avoiding that location, because my friend works there and had shared stories of how completely out of touch the customers and employees are.  (People literally saying "I'm tougher than Coronavirus!" And even a customer who got mad at her for sanitizing the card reader after every customer who used it.) We were on the way back from work and it was just quicker to stop there. Never again.

The more I learn about Walkertown, the more surprised I am that the library and it's librarians there are so awesome.
That is like the 1 redeeming quality.

How do you guys think Winston-Salem will be after the COVID-19 pandemic is over?

Winston will recover ok.  We don't depend on tourism, sports or concerts as much as other areas.   These will be the last areas to recover.   I also think Winston will remain attractive for those that work from home due to our lower cost of living and nice amenities and health care.
It will go back to normal, however,  hopefully people will have learned better hygiene habits.
Some businesses won’t make it — especially restaurants— but others will startup to fill the void.
Sunshine and rainbows.  Millennials will be okay its only our second economic deficit compared to the Great Depression since we have been legal Adults.  We got this!
Things will go back to normal. Then we’ll get a spike in cases at Baptist and no one will care. And we’ll learning nothing from any of this.
Probably the same but I bet there’ll be a stigma about sick people. You see someone cough in the grocery store? Stay the F away from them, etc.
I don’t want normal but I’ll settle for halfway. I worked too much and neglected my personal life.   I also didn’t like the influx of developers, raising the rents, effectively forcing out the people who made downtown what it was in the first place.  “Here’s a bullshit idea with the huge building we bought, a brewery! Here’s a bowling alley! And shhhh we’re gonna put a speakeasy in the basement!”  Maybe locals will have a chance again to open spots.
It will be awful, you should leave now while you still can
Completely agree about it being attractive for work from hone people. We moved from Mooresville 2 years ago partially for this reason.
I hope we keep one-way traffic in grocery stores, too.
Sure some people will learn nothing. Me, you and many others will permanently change how we live our lives.
That’s why there’s no toilet paper. Someone coughs and everyone shits.
What makes you say that?
From my viewing people aren't even paying attention to that
I literally was unaware of 1 way shopping. Makes sense, will follow that next time I go out. Thanks for mentioning it!
sounds good
Bahaha so true! I was in the grocery store the other day and someone coughed. I literally jumped. In my head I know that’s ridiculous but things are so tense right now.
Just a joke
Probably the same people who park right up on the curb.
I cough a LOT every spring. That's how my allergies manifest. I'm completely okay with people keeping their distance but I swear people try to run away from me even on phone calls these days.
Same here. This year allergies have been terrible. Mine seem to make my chest tight and throat itch so I sip water constantly.

But the shaded area is essentially the margin of error for the prediction, so we’ve got a wide range between not exceeding capacity and dramatically exceeding it - which would mean a spike in the mortality rate.What does this tell us? It tells us **we still have the time and ability** to minimize the loss of life in our state.To be blunt: We are not going to have widespread testing. There are lots of reasons for that - none of which have to do with our state and all of which have to do with the federal response - but it’s a reality. We’re still using tests and they're very important, but we're not going to test our way out of this like South Korea did. We just didn't get enough test kits fast enough.But - despite that major setback - it’s still possible to minimize the loss of life in our state by making sure we don’t max out the ICU beds. We just have to take social distancing very seriously for the next several weeks. In this model, OUR BEHAVIOR is the biggest variable. How seriously WE take this will ultimately determine the mortality rate.**Quick List*** We’ve only received 17% of the PPE that we requested from the federal government. That’s not good, and it’s why we’re sourcing from everywhere we can find and working with North Carolina manufacturers to switch production to PPE if at all possible.* The state’s unemployment insurance website and call center are still facing a nightmarish traffic jam as they get slammed with 50x the normal traffic, but we are adding servers and contracted with an additional call center to help field calls.

We’re still waiting on implementation guidance from the federal Department of Labor, at which point benefits will be paid in about two weeks. Independent contractors and people who are self-employed will qualify for the federal benefit - they do not currently qualify for the state benefit. I know the state website isn’t set up to receive applications from people who are contractors or self-employed and that’s part of what we need to fix. If you fall into this category, just file the application as best you can.* Gov. Cooper’s new executive order means no one can shut off your electricity, gas, or water for at least the next 60 days.* The U.S. Corps of Engineers is helping us scout for places that could be used as hospital expansions.* We've launched a hotline to help critical workers connect with child care (888-600-1685).STAY STRONG. We can do this.More updates soon,Sen. Jeff Jackson
Always appreciated, and Senator Jackson has been extremely active in keeping North Carolina residents up to date, even when while some other national senators from NC were playing down the virus entirely (Burr, Tillis) or just not mentioning it at all (Virginia Foxx).
Senator Jackson,   Are there any plans to try and limit the large scale gatherings in hardware stores? As someone who works in one, the amount of customers inside the store is unsafe at times. I understand the need to stay open for supplies and emergencies but a lot of people are taking advantage of us still being open.   Thank you.
Hopefully we can keep the trend going and keep coronavirus from going wild here. As always, thanks for the update!
In regards to scouting potential spaces for providing care: [Novant Health](https://www.journalnow.com/business/novant-s-realty-arm-buys-sears-property-at-hanes-mall/article_4776b23a-d9db-5e0b-8c08-760b6cab60c0.html) owns the former Sears location in Hanes Mall, which right across the street from Novant Health Forsyth Medical Center’s ED.
Would schools work for temporary hospital branches?
I follow this same projection graph, we keep moving the peak back, so efforts are working and hopefully soon will flatten.
What about rent? People are not able to pay rent and if this goes on through the month, or longer, as it seems to be doing they aren't going to be able to pay next month. What is being done regarding this?  You say there's record unemployment, as we know, so where is the relief for people that can't afford rent? There's a 60 day hold on power, etc, but not rent? This doesn't make sense that's generally people's biggest expense.
Thanks for the updates.   Any clue on when the $1,200 checks are in the mail / time frame at least?  Two weeks?
Thank you so much for your clarity!
It looks like our efforts could start to flatten the curve. That's encouraging.
Too many jobs are considered essential that aren't.   As far as I'm concerned, unless your work is required for people to live, it isn't essential.
My understanding is Home Depot is announcing a new policy soon designed to limit the number of people in the store at once.
30 day hold on all eviction proceedings from the Chief Justice of the state Supreme Court, too. But that expires in about two weeks, I think. Can't do anything else with rent without General Assembly going to back into session and passing something, but right now we're not scheduled to go back until April 28th.
I’ll be surprised if we see any action on rent at the state or federal level. Free housing is just not something these ghouls are willing to tolerate for even a couple months.
earliest i read was april 6th but it could be several months if the irs doesn't have direct deposit info for you. i also believe they are starting with people who filed taxes in 2019 and then doing 2018.
Thank you, is there any word for Lowes?
Honestly, I really appreciate the response. Thank you.
Are there talks of convening remotely for the General Assembly?
I truly believe we're going to end up with exactly that, a bill at the end of the 60 days that many have no way of paying.   The stimulus check isn't going to do much, let's be real. 1200 isn't that much, espcially if your rend is $600 or higher. The unemployment will help, but with the system the way it is right now it's not like many are getting a real chance here. Gig workers, like myself, are already having to wait and see when we will be able to get any assistance. I mean as of right now we are just being denied which means we then have to refile and wait again. With little to no real solution anytime soon. Which,  I do understand, but it is what it is.   At this point something needs to be done nationally. Not locally. The fed needs to ensure that mortgages are put on hold as well as rent. For a minimum 60 days. People are out of work due to no fault of their own. We are told to stay inside which means ultimately higher electricity bills at the end of the month. This is just a problem that's going to continue to spiral out of control and it doesn't seem like to many are concerned. I know people are, it's just frustrating.
I just went to Lowe’s today to get some supplies and was really impressed with some of the things I saw:  disinfected carts in separate area to choose from, a plexi glass wall in front of each cash register to separate customer from cashier and keep any sneezes or coughs from spreading, painted areas in line 6 ft apart that say “wait here” to separate customers from eachother, as as soon as EACH customer leaves they wipe down the debit card machine and counter with Lysol wipes. BIG LOWES FAN RIGHT HERE!!
Not yet.
So here's the thing. If rents not paid they can't pay the mortgage on the building of have any funds. So they don't get paid either. How do you think that works out? Do you think that a landlord evicting tenants right now is a good look? That they'd have an easy time replacing them any time soon? Would it not be better to work with someone that is already there and do what you can?  Or you know the landlords could have had a few months saved up in case of an emergency like everyone else has been told to do for so long.... Oh wait. They don't.   Quit licking boots. It's not a good look for you.
Owning property is not a job.
I work at a Lowes and can assure you the carts are not disinfected unless you saw someone actually doing it. We do not have the man power to clean accordingly. There are about 30 people out of work due to the risk of the virus and the rest of us have to pick up the slack. A lot of our cashiers went to Florida for spring break and someone they were with tested positive for COVID-19, but our cashiers were not tested. We have no idea if the cashiers are carrying the virus or not. Corporate is running us into the ground with their demands. This weekend is our “Spring Black Friday” and there are ads promoting large sales to encourage people to come inside the store and shop. The ad is not for essential items either, it’s mulch and flowers, paint, flooring, and appliances. Home Depot cancelled their promotions to encourage customers to stay home....all that’s going to do is drive people into our stores. WHY CANT PEOPLE STAY HOME!! The difference in leadership between Home Depot and Lowe’s is astonishing. Home Depot is trying to help get things under control while Lowe’s is trying to grab any dollar they can.
I want to take a moment to say thank you for keeping citizens of NC informed. I have been following your career since you made headlines over the NC GOP not calling the budget vote. I admire how you fight for those you represent. It's sad that I don't live in your district to be able to vote for you and can only hope that we see leaders with your determination to stand up for our rights here in the Triad area.
Well, all I can share is my own experience at the Lowe’s here in Concord NC, and with my initial post, that’s exactly what I did. This store should be a model for other Lowe’s to follow because it sure seems like your area Lowe’s stores are not doing these things to protect their employees and customers and I’m sorry you’re being faced with that. And I agree with you, a world wide Pandemic is definitely NOT a time for companies to focus on profits!!
That amount of condescension should fit comfortably right back up your own ass.
Magnificent.

Coronavirus in North Carolina: Map and Case Count

[The color getting lighter indicates a good thing...](https://i.imgur.com/DpsvNIZ.png)  But it's so hard to know if it's lack of testing vs. social distancing starting to work. Note: I believe social distancing WILL work if people actually do it, just not sure when we'll see it really start to level out.
*looks at Forsyth County, whose rate of doubling is the only one going up*
Isn’t this similar to a population density map?
https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html  Johns Hopkins has the most up to date and comprehensive info I’ve seen overall
Damn paywall
From what I can tell it's both. That's my biggest concern with all of this - we're starting to see that Italy and China had misrepresented and underreported their case counts, and that the undiagnosed cases are still a huge risk. I think this is going to cause massive global damage unless we can all isolate as much as possible for at least the next 2 months (and work as hard as possible to solve the major shortages of PPE/ventilators/etc). These strategies can work, but only if we ALL follow the advice of the experts at the CDC and WHO.
Everyone was still out and about last week and not taking it seriously, remember its a week lag time, most people don't think one week/two weeks ahead.
What paywall? NYT and a few other big newspapers are waiving subscription fees for COVID articles (as they should).
Every idiot fuck was at Walmart on 150 yesterday. It was so packed people were parking on the grass.
> remember its a week lag time  At least, maybe two. This weeks' improvements in infection velocity are a result of social distancing measures put in place over the last three weeks.
Well when I click the article theres a big old pop up asking for email info and offering subscription options. That’s a paywall, it takes up a whole damn mobile screen.
Unpopular opinion: Some of us still need to grocery shop, you know, in order to put food on the table so we can stay at home.  My wife and I have limited it down to once every 10 days or so.
Uggh, I wouldn't know, I'm actually staying home.
