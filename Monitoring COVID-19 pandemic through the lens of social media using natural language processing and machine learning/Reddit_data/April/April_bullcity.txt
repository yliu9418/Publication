Volunteers needed. Help us crush COVID-19. Durham-Chapel Hill-Raleigh can band together to help destroy this virus and keep our neighbors and community safe.
Do you have a 3D printer?  You can help print parts for 3D-printed face shields.  So far 100% of the places I have called still need and want PPE to help protect themselves.  This includes medical staff working at nursing facilities, our bus drivers, our police force, our Firefighters, etc.  We need help with driving deliveries, making home made masks, creating ear savers and much more.  Sign up on [trianglecovid.com. ](https://trianglecovid.com)  Thanks for your support!  These are 100% free donations.  Many of us have spent our own money on filament, materials, 3d-printers, etc and just want to help keep our community safe.
Trillions printed to bail out irresponsible stock investors. Zero dollars to protect police, nurses, etc. We're left to cobble something together with scraps.  Heads need to roll.
Your website had a dial for ear savers, but I can’t find any more information about that. Are those the crocheted long skinny ovals with buttons on each end?  I’ve seen those and could make some easily, if there is a need.
Source on zero dollars?
Full info in my blog post. yes, there's a need. get printin'!!! :)  https://blog.ktz.me/3d-printed-covid-19-face-shields/
If that's true, why are we being asked to make masks for them for free?
If the police dept, for example, had money for equipment, would there be posts on reddit trying to get resources from the community instead?
Thank you for the link. I can’t print anything as I don’t have a 3D printer, but I can make up the yarn and button versions of ear savers pretty quickly. They look like this    https://www.instructables.com/id/Crochet-Adjustable-Ear-Saver/
So, source on zero dollars?
Nice!
No, that explains why these organizations can't buy them elsewhere. It doesn't explain why they can't pay for them.
I’m not sure about zero dollars but I know that 100% of phone calls I make to surrounding first responders don’t have PPE and want any help we can give them. The only PPE from official means is going to hospitals and even then we have doctors from those hospitals wanting us to supply them.
Sounds reasonable.  The still uncited 0 dollars from Captain Hyperbole above doesn't.  Keep up the good work on trying to get the ppe to the folks who need it.
So, let me get this straight. The organizations CAN pay for the masks these volunteers are making, but they won't?  I think it's great that OP and the volunteers are so generous, but I am angry that they're required to be when there's supposed to be trillions of dollars around to supposedly, help relieve this crisis.

Nursing Home/ Large Residential Care: List of Facility Names, County, Number/Cases, Number/Death [COVID-19 Outbreak]

Thank you for posting this.  I live close to Pruitt Health and hear sirens at night going there.  Very sad.
Pruitt Health has a sign out front that says "Heroes work here" and somehow that sign feels a bit unearned.
Yep.  Nothing heroic about caring for the forgotten and those isolated from their families as a deadly respiratory virus burns through their facility. /s
The virus got into the facility because of the workers there and they have a high death toll. Just saying...
Probably should have abandoned all of the residents instead. /s
Have you looked into how bad Pruitt health's record is? They are a terrible facility.
Put on a mask and get to work.  Or sit on your couch and snipe at people who do.  Your call.
Great arguement.
Brilliant response.
You missed the irony of your misspelling.
Weird follow up, but okay.
Useful.  I'd call you a hero, but you haven't earned it.
What are you even ranting about anymore? Do you work for Pruitt or something?
Im not ranting, just calling out your cunty behavior.  We good?
So you do work for Pruitt?
No.  Do you work for the Hero Accreditation Agency?
What is with your "hero" argument"
You took umbrage with the heroes sign outside of Pruitt.  What's with being a cunt?
Heroes tend not to let people die and then buy their own sign to give themselves a pat on the back.   Pruitt has been a trash hole even before this happened.
Source they bought their own sign?
source they didn't.
You made the assertion.
That i did.

I'm a journalism student doing a package on the developments of the Reopen NC organizer revealing to have had COVID-19. I would like to interview some people with their thoughts on it.

is this a school thing? if it is, working reporters would be 100% down to assist you getting sources to interview, you'd just go their outlet's website and email them directly (abc11.com, wral.com, cbs17.com).  edit: NM. https://www.reddit.com/r/memes/comments/ga20ph/knock_yourself_out_karen/foxg1n5/
Looks like everything was deleted. What did we miss?

But the shaded area is essentially the margin of error for the prediction, so we’ve got a wide range between not exceeding capacity and dramatically exceeding it - which would mean a spike in the mortality rate.What does this tell us? It tells us **we still have the time and ability** to minimize the loss of life in our state.To be blunt: We are not going to have widespread testing. There are lots of reasons for that - none of which have to do with our state and all of which have to do with the federal response - but it’s a reality. We’re still using tests and they're very important, but we're not going to test our way out of this like South Korea did. We just didn't get enough test kits fast enough.But - despite that major setback - it’s still possible to minimize the loss of life in our state by making sure we don’t max out the ICU beds. We just have to take social distancing very seriously for the next several weeks. In this model, OUR BEHAVIOR is the biggest variable. How seriously WE take this will ultimately determine the mortality rate.**Quick List*** We’ve only received 17% of the PPE that we requested from the federal government. That’s not good, and it’s why we’re sourcing from everywhere we can find and working with North Carolina manufacturers to switch production to PPE if at all possible.* The state’s unemployment insurance website and call center are still facing a nightmarish traffic jam as they get slammed with 50x the normal traffic, but we are adding servers and contracted with an additional call center to help field calls. If you’re having serious trouble, please fill out this customer contact form: [https://des.nc.gov/customer-contact-form](https://des.nc.gov/customer-contact-form).* Regarding the federal unemployment benefit that just passed, it will be administered by the state. We’re still waiting on implementation guidance from the federal Department of Labor, at which point benefits will be paid in about two weeks. Independent contractors and people who are self-employed will qualify for the federal benefit - they do not currently qualify for the state benefit. I know the state website isn’t set up to receive applications from people who are contractors or self-employed and that’s part of what we need to fix. If you fall into this category, just file the application as best you can.* Gov. Cooper’s new executive order means no one can shut off your electricity, gas, or water for at least the next 60 days.* The U.S. Corps of Engineers is helping us scout for places that could be used as hospital expansions.* We've launched a hotline to help critical workers connect with child care (888-600-1685).More updates soon,Sen. Jeff Jackson
Excellent post Senator, thanks for the update.
Interesting source and chart to shed some positive on a horrible situation: [Chart](https://imgur.com/S9UeTT3)      *[Source: US Health Weather Map by Kinsa](https://healthweather.us/)*  Basically, while the healthcare system will still likely be in a very rough situation in April (as shared by Sen. Jackson), the population as a whole by staying home is staying quite a bit healthier than an average year during flu season.  Stay safe folks, and stay home. Many thanks to our healthcare and essential worker.
Is there anything concrete as to why we are only getting 17% of our PPE requests filled by the Federal Govt? FL is getting 100%, right? Are there other factors besides the obvious?
>The U.S. Corps of Engineers is helping us scout for places that could be used as hospital expansions.  RTP has lot of open space that could potentially be used for this
These updates are extremely helpful. Thank you for taking the time to write and post them.
At least a little bit of encouraging news! Here's hoping for that curve to bend down. Any news on the state level on mortgage deferments?
Is there any reason for stating that we should consider a bend encouraging? If, as you stated our testing capacity is extremely limited, does that mean that this bending might simply be an attribute of said capacity limits, than a reflection of the actual number of cases?   Edit: also, I really appreciate you taking the time to do these updates. Thank you.
Keep it coming, Jeff. If this is your SOP as a state senator, I wish to volunteer for your federal campaign.
Hi Senator, do you know whether court will start happening again? Or will that continue to be shut down?   Thank you again for these updates.
Does anyone know if North Carolina will be extending the length of unemployment benefits? Right now it seems to be about 12 weeks but if that ends and the federal government is still willing to pay out will we receive federal unemployment and not state?
Thanks for the info, if I have PPE I want to donate to hospitals who should I contact about that?
Any word on protections for renters who can't pay their rent? My apartment complex is owned by a company and they have stated multiple times that rent is still due before the 5th and they are unable to defer rent or do anything basically. Are they allowed to charge late fees or eviction filing fees?
The obvious being our request made by a Dem gov, vs FL's request being made by a Rep gov?  Not being sarcastic, that's the way I see it, but want to see if that is what others think too.
No other factors. Just the obvious.
Northgate mall...but I'd would guess Duke has already built out plans for that, I would hope.
If you’re in need of assistance with your mortgage, auto loans, credit cards, etc just reach out to your bank to discuss. Most every major bank is flat out publicizing the option and I imagine there’s a fairly low bar for approval given the scenario we are facing. The federal government has essentially asked/instructed the largest banks to do what it takes to provide assistance to consumers and businesses.
According to https://covidtracking.com/data/state/north-carolina, which tracks our state data over time, we tested 3k in the past day and 2k the day before. While it is slightly encouraging news, we do need multiple days to really tell if the curve is changing
There is none because the bend wasn't curving -- it was just a mid-day update which only had partial reports of new cases.  It IS encouraging that we aren't seeing new cases extrapolating, although this might be a circumstance of testing limits.
Wake county no longer tests mild cases. We are no longer comparing the same values in the graph.
I really don't know if the majority will go for that. It's possible. We'll find out this month when we go back.
Duke, UNC, and WakeMed all have pages set up:  [https://www.unchealthcare.org/coronavirus/ways-to-help/](https://www.unchealthcare.org/coronavirus/ways-to-help/)  [https://www.dukehealth.org/covid-19-update/how-you-can-help-during-covid-19](https://www.dukehealth.org/covid-19-update/how-you-can-help-during-covid-19)  [https://www.wakemed.org/body.cfm?id=5630&fr=true](https://www.wakemed.org/body.cfm?id=5630&fr=true)
The state Supreme Court has put a temporary hold on all eviction proceedings.
I think the implied obvious thing is that POTUS owns a resort in FL that could really use an uptick in bookings.
Elderly population in FL places them in a higher risk category than many other states.
If I remember correctly, OK is getting 7x their requests.
Duke also has plenty of empty dormitories on campus right next to the hospital.
Everybody except State Employees' Credit Union at least. They want you to fall behind on payments before they'll do anything to assist you.
I've heard via call center people online that it's important to mention to them that you've been impacted by COVID-19 or Corona Virus. At least some apparently have instructions to handle it differently it that's mentioned.
> just reach out to your bank to discuss   I imagine most banks and CC companies' call centers are getting hammered now; so if you need to call them, do it at off peak hours, like very early in morning or late at night if possible.
Thanks for the response. I asked because I know myself and other people were laid off from the Corona virus and I filed my unemployment earlier than the fed bill passing to avoid swamping the DES and now I'm basically being fine at $1,200 for doing that. This seems counterintuitive.
Very true!
That’s unfortunate.

Yep, I’ve called them... they won’t kick in any assistance until you fall behind.

Resources for businesses affected by coronavirus
This is an unprecedented time for everyone in North Carolina and with the statewide stay-at-home order, businesses everywhere are struggling to keep their doors open. Here is a list of resources for businesses in North Carolina that may be able to help some business owners. It's a list of loans available, how to file an unemployment insurance claim, new family and medical leave rules, and even how to begin producing PPE to support healthcare workers. With all the uncertainty floating around about the economy and our state, hopefully this list can answer some questions for people and start connecting them to resources that can help.Business Resources: https://edpnc.com/covid-19-resources/
