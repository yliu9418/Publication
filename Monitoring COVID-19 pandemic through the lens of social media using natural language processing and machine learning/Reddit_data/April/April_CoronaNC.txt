He was 43..     Please take social distancing seriously and *wear a mask* if you have to go out.  Also, numerous reports from doctors and nurses have warned how quickly covid-19 patients go from "breathing ok" to "blue and requiring a ventilator".  If you're told to go home be aware that your condition can change rapidly.   edit...   [here's one of those reports from today](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/many-new-york-coronavirus-patients-are-young-surprising-doctors-1.1415881)
Jesus this is depressing.
I kind of dislike this article. Nobody ever said younger people weren't at risk for infection. They said you're less likely to die. France didn't say they were only treating older people. They said 40-50% of their ICU patients were under 50. Americans had selective hearing... Or maybe wishful thinking.
 >Nobody ever said younger people weren't at risk for infection.   **Neither does the article.**  It says the surprising thing is that 20% of those hospitalized are under 40.  Everyone including the CDC and WHO said for months that young people would be infected but *they would only get a mild case.*  This was based on reports out of China and Seattle.  Italy, France, and now NYC have proven that to be false.  Young people are ending up in the icu and on ventilators.  We were told repeatedly that would not happen so young people went on [Spring break](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/01/us/coronavirus-texas-austin-spring-break-cabo.html), [went to Mardi Gras](https://www.nydailynews.com/coronavirus/ny-coronavirus-louisiana-mardi-gras-new-orleans-spread-20200325-yvou4pa34fbyze7hub4kbg7way-story.html), etc.. and now we need to get the word out that covid-19 will absolutely put young people in the hospital too.
I guess I interpreted the information coming out of china differently. I don't recall the WHO or CDC ever saying young people would only get it mildly.  I read the first several studies and was always under the impression that younger, healthy, people absolutely can get it severely. They're just less likely to die.   From the get-go I felt like information about the severity of cases was being twisted. Hell, that first big study explained their methods of determining a clinically mild case and it was surely not what a layman would consider mild. So that info alone was communicated deceptively.  Anyway, I'm not really debating you. I just wasn't ever really paying much attention to what was on the news so perhaps you're right about the original messages from WHO, etc.

Symptoms COVID 19 - Self Reporting
In a research effort to understand the spread of COVID 19, our team at the AutonLab at Carnegie Mellon University developed a questionnaire (IRB approved) to self report symptoms nationwide. We encourage all of you to participate. This voluntary questionnaire will take you less than 5 minutes to complete and will allow to better understand prevalence patterns of COVID-19 and similar diseases in your area. Participation in this study is voluntary and will not result in any compensation.  For any further information concerning this research project, please contact me at [vjeansel@andrew.cmu.edu](mailto:vjeansel@andrew.cmu.edu)Please participate and share widely this questionnaire: [https://qfreeaccountssjc1.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\_eJAdOyhusboucDj](https://qfreeaccountssjc1.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_eJAdOyhusboucDj)

Would you prefer we only answer this if we believe we have contracted/are diagnosed with covid-19?  I'm uncertain if I should complete your survey or if I'd screw up the results because I'm not actually part of your desired group.
I think allergy season is going to skew your results
Everyone is invited to participate, even if you don't have any symptoms, it is important to better understand the spread
Symptoms should be different
I had chest tightness and shortness of breath from what I thought were my allergies few weeks ago but then started to get flu symptoms next.  Asthma from allergies is a thing for some of us.

Without adequate testing there is very little reason to believe the US numbers.  In addition, many people are staying home because they do not have adequate insurance or a regular doctor.  Chances are, these cases will be attributed to regular flu or pneumonia.
Then there’s no reason to believe much of anybody’s numbers.
Some countries have done a better job than others, but the US has a particular problem when it comes to adequate testing.

We have more cases from ONE nursing home in Henderson County that brings them up too 100.  The elderly in these homes are sitting ducks across North Carolina. They MAKE THEM share thermometers.
In pasquotank co, we were hanging on at 10 cases for awhile, then there were 5 new cases from the prison. Now there are 19. Not bad bad, but not good either.

Damn!  That's borderline criminal.  I would have expected this level of deception  from Communist China.  This is done solely to keep the public from seeing the failure of the government and corporations in a crisis.  The CDC knew for *decades* that a pandemic was inevitable, yet failed to prepare these facilities for it.  The leadership of the nursing home facilities should have started to protect their patients in early February when it was obvious that this novel virus would impact them.  They didn't.  Who wants to bet that the pandemic relief bill doesn't include something that absolves hospital and nursing homes from liability?  Because I'm betting that none of the people responsible will face any consequences.

The call focused on regulatory issues, no appropriations. I'm cherry picking from notaries, advanced directives, wills, etc.   It is my understanding from listening to the call that it is explicitly illegal to wear a mask in public. [Representative Carson Smith](https://nchouserepublicans.com/members/carson-smith/) requested information on why there was a proposed change to the current requirement (it said "for any reason").    The other Representatives who responded recognized his EMS, firefighter, and law enforcement background. And, Representatives further explained the change was based on society's movement towards public health.  Rep. Carson Smith appears to support the current position to allow law enforcement the ability to identify people. He stated that he will make a change to say "when the pandemic is done" or "sunset at a specified date" or further restrict the allowance from "for any reason."   The other point is the DMV in certain parts of the state are being used as places to sample the population. Employees are working on COVID-related activities.  And - if you have a marriage certificate (which I think was after March 1 2020), it's only valid for 60 days. So, if you have second thoughts due to shelter in place. Divorce could potentially be extremely easy! However, there was a proposed change to February 1 2021 for discussion at the next meeting.  There was more discussed. These peaked my interest.

>The release didn’t name the plants.  >The state news release said that the plants are doing temperature checks, providing personal protective equipment and encouraging social distancing when possible.  Gosh wsoc...  would it kill you to provide a link to the release?  btw, we already know one of the plants is a Smithfield plant, which is owned by a Chinese company.
Smithfield in Tar Heel Mountaire in Lumber Bridge Possibly Campbell Soup in Maxton
I mean what company isn’t owned by a Chinese conglomerate? They probably didn’t get it from a Chinese person
maybe roll back the fucking racist dog whistle there
Mountaire in Siler City is another one.  https://www.chathamnewsrecord.com/stories/chatham-nc-covid-19-mountaire-positive-cases,5226
Don't kill the narrative of all "insert choice word to describe demographic" is bad
Precisely the problem, boycott China.
There’s nothing wrong with being apprehensive towards China-based companies.  It’s a state totalitarian government which directly bleeds into the “private” sector. State-controlled capitalism.  Not to mention they couldn’t give two shits about the integrity and safety of their products.  Boycott China, buy local and domestic.
And they recently donated frozen chicken to employees at the local hospital.
Good luck with that buddy. Why stop at China? Why not boycott any company that treats their workers poorly? Oh wait that would be socialism, right? It’s only bad when a Chinese company does it.
Because China is a systemic problem. We don’t have a worldwide pandemic on our hands due to Tyson or Smithfield issues.  China has a rap sheet a mile long on human rights violations and downright genocide.  It’s also a problem when most critical supplies are being made in China. That puts us in a very vulnerable position. And consumers are aiding and abetting that by continuing to blindly buy Chinese goods or funding Chinese companies.  China is the greater problem on an economic scale. And also on a military scale. The big evil meat companies can’t start world wars or take over territories (HK/Taiwan/Tibet).

Covid-19 is spreading to America’s South with unnerving speed

The article is behind a paywall so... TL;DR? I would have stopped reading after the following line:  *The Empire State then had twice as many confirmed cases of coronavirus as all southern states combined (the 11 Confederate states, plus Kentucky).*  I didn't realize the Confederacy was still around.
Y’ALL...WE ARE NOT New York state.” Alabama’s governor, Kay Ivey, said that on March 26th, explaining why she was not locking her state down. At that time, she was right. The Empire State then had twice as many confirmed cases of coronavirus as all southern states combined (the 11 Confederate states, plus Kentucky). But the South is becoming more like New York.  The virus is spreading throughout the region with unnerving speed. Between the end of March and April 20th, the number of cases in the dozen southern states rose from 11,700 to 127,500, three times as fast as the national increase.   As elsewhere, the largest concentration of cases has been in cities. Greater Miami and New Orleans both have around 15,000, more than Los Angeles. In the ten days after the first confirmed case in the Big Easy, the number in Louisiana grew faster than anywhere else in the world, says Gary Wagner of the University of Louisiana at Lafayette. In mid-April, the New Orleans area had the highest per-person death rate from covid-19 of any American city, and Louisiana was second to New York state in deaths per person.  The South has also seen a rapid spread in suburbs and towns. Figures from the New York Times show how fast cases have been doubling in each county. On April 8th the South had 27 counties where they were doubling every two and a half days or more frequently. In the West, there are only three counties where cases were rising that quickly. Most of the areas affected have been suburbs or smaller cities such as Shreveport, Louisiana and Albany, Georgia. The growth rate has since slowed but infections contracted in early April will produce hospitalisations and deaths in early May. According to Mr Wagner, four southern states (Louisiana, Florida, Tennessee and Georgia) had faster growth rates during the first 36 days after their first confirmed cases than Spain or Italy.  As a result, the South is entering the most dangerous period in which numbers are large, growth is still high and health systems start to buckle. According to the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, New York and New Jersey have passed the peak of hospital demand but Georgia and Texas will not hit theirs until early May. “The worst is yet to come,” fears Peter Hotez, of Baylor University in Waco, Texas. That is worrying not just in itself but because three things make the South especially vulnerable to covid-19.  First, state policymakers were slow to respond to the virus and are being quick to loosen the lockdown. Four southern governors waited until early April before issuing stay-at-home orders; that was almost two weeks after California’s order. Barely three weeks later, seven states have either reopened, or plan to reopen, everything from beaches, gyms and tattoo parlours to shops, restaurants and (in the case of Tennessee) most businesses.   As a result, southerners are talking and acting differently. They are more likely than other Americans to say that they are not worried about the virus, according to YouGov, which does polling for The Economist. And they have been slow to adopt social distancing. Unacast, a company which analyses online tracking data, found they are limiting daily encounters with others less than most Americans. And four-fifths of counties where people were travelling the most in mid-April are in the south, according to Cuebiq, a measurement company. Infections caught then could turn into disease soon.  The second reason for the South’s vulnerability is demography. The region contains disproportionate numbers of old, black, Hispanic, uninsured, unhealthy and (a sometimes forgotten group) incarcerated Americans. That is an almost complete litany of susceptibilities to covid-19. In Florida’s Sumter county, home to one of the largest residential complexes for the old (and the fastest-growing metropolitan area in America), the median age is 67, care homes are suffering exponential growth in cases and the county’s death rate from covid-19 is a sky-high 10%. Florida’s governor is mobilising the national guard to boost coronavirus virus testing in care homes. His state is not unique. One in six deaths in Louisiana are in care homes.  Along with the vulnerable old, African-Americans have disproportionately high mortality rates. In Louisiana, blacks account for 32% of the state’s population but 70% of covid-19 deaths. In Mississippi, the figures are 37% and 72%. Blacks (and Hispanics) are more likely than whites to live in crowded conditions, more likely to have impaired underlying health and more likely to work in occupations (care workers, government clerks) that bring them into contact with others during quarantine. All these put them at greater risk. Fifty-eight per cent of African-Americans, or 24m people, live in the old confederacy.  The region also likes to lock people up and prisoners have much in common with other imperilled groups. A disproportionate number are black and, like care homes and cruise ships, prisons are incubators of the virus. Seven of the top ten states ranked by incarceration rates are in the South.  Put all this together and you find that southerners, on average, are sicker than others, more likely to contract the disease and more likely to die if infected. As Louisiana’s governor put it, we “have more than our fair share of people who have the co-morbidities that make them especially vulnerable,” meaning more obesity, high blood pressure, asthma and so on. The Gallup Health and Well Being index has worked out an index of covid-19 risk factors by state. Every southern state has above-average risk; four of the five most vulnerable are southern. “A toxic mix,” says Dr Hotez.  Perhaps this might not matter quite so much were it not for the third weakness: the medical system. As elsewhere in America, the South has plenty of large, modern hospitals. But it has more people without health insurance than any other region, with the lack of coverage worst in rural areas. Nineteen rural hospitals closed in 2019, mainly in the South; 170 have shut since 2005, says the Sheps Centre at the University of North Carolina. Some of the problems reflect national trends but southern states have added an extra dimension of their own: politically inspired restriction of health insurance. With fewer rural hospitals, patients must go to rural health clinics, which rely on federal funding. But eight of the 12 southern states have refused an offer to expand Medicaid, a federally funded programme to provide health insurance to the poorest, which was part of Obamacare. That has reduced the ability of clinics to deal with the coming flood of cases and left the very people who are most vulnerable anyway with less medical help.  “You could be looking at a perfect storm,” says Thomas LaVeist, the dean of public health at Tulane University in New Orleans. “When this is over, the South will be the region of the country that will be most severely impacted.”
Head over to the post in r/coronavirus to find out the entire south is white racists.  I learn something new about myself every day on reddit.
I mean, that is exactly why I left the south. Everyone was racist and it was institutionalized. But YMMV I guess.
I grew up in a small suburb in Minnesota and outside the cities it seems much more racist then the south.  I didn’t know that minorities lived outside cities until I moved to the south.   It because I was racist but because I was so Ignorant.  Where I grew up whites lived in suburbs and small towns minorities lived in cities so that’s what I figured the rest of the country was like.   Didn’t realize how ignorant I was until I moved to the south.   I don’t know a single racist in the south but knew a bunch in Minnesota.
I legitimately rented from two different landlords who told me they were glad I came along because they didn't want to rent to black people.

Sounds an awful lot like she went to the rally sick based on her Facebook entry. I wonder if anyone who went is getting nervous now?
Haha well
from the article.....  >"She never left her house during her quarantine, so she has not been at any rally or any of the functions that we've done," Smith said.
Not ironic, just crazy contagious. The real eye opener will be the antibody test. Then you’ll see how many people got it and recovered with little to no symptoms.
Yet she previously claimed she HAD gone to the rally. The whole story is suspect.
she wasnt at anyt rally.  i know for a fact.

>As reported last week, Linda Howard, at Alston Brook in Lexington, said she would not release information publicly and would not say whether that location had a positive COVID-19 case. Data released Monday by the state shows 41 people associated with Alston Brook in Lexington have tested positive for COVID-19, and two people have died.    wtf.

[also...](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/many-new-york-coronavirus-patients-are-young-surprising-doctors-1.1415881) > “They look like they have the flu. Within hours, they need oxygen. Within a few more hours they need a ventilator.”
I have another video. The doctors have "a score" to triage patients. You are NO LONGER an individual patient as doctors in the ICU shift to "population health."  I believe (and I'm not shitting you) my 85 year old mom is going to have to die at home. The doctors could put her on a ventilator for a couple of hours only to cut her off for a healthier, younger person.  Population health over individualized patient care.  Also - get that Advanced Directive written and make sure it's known to the hospital. When they "compare" patients, the fact that you said "keep me going" might be the difference than someone similar to you on a ventillator who was silent.  Shit is going to get fucking real as we go up-and-up the peak!

But the shaded area is essentially the margin of error for the prediction, so we’ve got a wide range between not exceeding capacity and dramatically exceeding it - which would mean a spike in the mortality rate.What does this tell us? It tells us **we still have the time and ability** to minimize the loss of life in our state.To be blunt: We are not going to have widespread testing. There are lots of reasons for that - none of which have to do with our state and all of which have to do with the federal response - but it’s a reality. We’re still using tests and they're very important, but we're not going to test our way out of this like South Korea did. We just didn't get enough test kits fast enough.But - despite that major setback - it’s still possible to minimize the loss of life in our state by making sure we don’t max out the ICU beds. We just have to take social distancing very seriously for the next several weeks. In this model, OUR BEHAVIOR is the biggest variable. How seriously WE take this will ultimately determine the mortality rate.**Quick List*** We’ve only received 17% of the PPE that we requested from the federal government. That’s not good, and it’s why we’re sourcing from everywhere we can find and working with North Carolina manufacturers to switch production to PPE if at all possible.* The state’s unemployment insurance website and call center are still facing a nightmarish traffic jam as they get slammed with 50x the normal traffic, but we are adding servers and contracted with an additional call center to help field calls. If you’re having serious trouble, please fill out this customer contact form: [https://des.nc.gov/customer-contact-form](https://des.nc.gov/customer-contact-form).* Regarding the federal unemployment benefit that just passed, it will be administered by the state. We’re still waiting on implementation guidance from the federal Department of Labor, at which point benefits will be paid in about two weeks. Independent contractors and people who are self-employed will qualify for the federal benefit - they do not currently qualify for the state benefit. I know the state website isn’t set up to receive applications from people who are contractors or self-employed and that’s part of what we need to fix. If you fall into this category, just file the application as best you can.* Gov. Cooper’s new executive order means no one can shut off your electricity, gas, or water for at least the next 60 days.* The U.S. Corps of Engineers is helping us scout for places that could be used as hospital expansions.* We've launched a hotline to help critical workers connect with child care (888-600-1685).More updates soon,Sen.

Thank you for the update. That's a huge margin of error in the UW model. Let's hope projections are accurate.   If we don't get the testing issues sorted then cases will just flare back up after restrictions are lifted. At some point we're going to have to do testing and contact tracing once things are at a manageable level. Please do everything you can to urge  federal leadership about this.  It's not possible to end an outbreak with social distancing alone unless we wait for herd immunity.
Senator,  Isn't it hard to conclude the bend isn't just a result of the lack of recent testing due to CDC guidance last week to not get tested anymore unless you have severe symptoms?  Also, what is the new surveillance model?   How are we able to track the spread if most cases are at home unreported?
Regarding the dip in new cases, how much of that is a reflection of less testing?  Anecdotally, my neighbor almost certainly has it (his daughter tested positive and he had symptoms), but he wasn't tested and told to go home, self quarantine, and return to ER if he has trouble breathing. Sounds like that's very common. Wake Co.
Jeff:  I need confirmation from the state that independent contractors and self-employed WILL be SUCCESSFULLT processed by the state for unemployment - rejected by the state - and approved for the federal payment.   Does the on-line unemployment system allow for this capability to get the federal funds? OR - Do self-employed or independent contractors need to go to an office and hand fill-out paperwork to get the federal funds?   26 payments of $600 is a huge amount of money. The process needs to be clear and I appreciate you confirming the details.
The goal is to have the online application work even if you’re only eligible for the federal benefit. I’m not sure we’re there right now, but it’s an immediate priority.

Social distancing is now our primary weapon against the coronavirus. These next few weeks will determine whether we beat this thing and minimize the loss of life. We still have time to flatten the curve!

He is so freaking awesome!
Senator Jackson,    Thank you for your informative updates.  I am sharing this with you in the hope that NC can utilize labcorp to make these rapid tests. They test for antibodies at home. We could utilize drive thru tests or at the blood banks, free test with blood donation if you have the antibodies? We need this!!  https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/928150  https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/home-fingerprick-blood-test-may-help-detect-your-exposure-coronavirus-n1176086
I'm all about this! Too bad there's still many big gathering happening around NC...
I second that. In fact, I came here to say exactly that. I have been impressed with him for years, but he has absolutely blown me away over the last few weeks!!!
Right? What a wonderful world that would be. Government that actually works.
I'm not sure that LabCorp has the capability to manufacture these in mass quantities. Lateral flow assays require very specific machinery.
Would you like a psychiatrist referral?
You have facts and opinions mixed up.
No one but you has mentioned TV.

While the author makes some decent points, this article should be taken with a handful of salt.  * While it looks like a scholarly article, it hasn't been peer-reviewed or published anywhere. That doesn't make it invalid, but it does mean it hasn't undergone any meaningful scrutiny, which puts it closer in kind to an in-depth blog post or reddit comment. * The author is a ghost. Googling their full name brings up this article and literally nothing else. Again, this doesn't necessarily invalidate the content, but it makes it difficult to suss out this person's credentials and possible motivations.
[Medical student's disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_students%27_disease) is a very interesting phenomenon to me. I would be very interested in seeing research on whether there is a similar effect on public health.
The author also ignores the fact that death is just one possible outcome to COVID-19 patients. Unlike influenza, there are several documented long-term health impacts, such as irreversible lung damage, neurological issues resulting in cognitive impairment and loss of senses, strokes caused by blood clots in patients in their 30s and 40s, and liver damage.
It just bugs me any time I see someone comparing this to the flu in general.  * It's far more contagious than the flu, so even if the mortality rate is similar, letting it spread unchecked would mean far more cases and, therefore, far more deaths. * We have vaccines and proven treatments for the flu. For COVID we have neither. * If you recover from the flu, you can't get infected with that exact strain again (at least for a while). The jury is still out on whether that holds true with COVID.  That's just off the top of my head.
There's also long-term mental health impacts of being without a job, unable to find a new job, and having bills accumulate while you get no assistance whatsoever.  There's also long-term impacts of putting your all into a business, sacrificing a lot to make it happen and successful, only to have it come crumbling down after years due to a government mandate.
>due to a government mandate.  That's a cognitive error. This is due to a global pandemic.
The microscopic virus is not keeping doors shut itself. Don’t try to use passive-aggressive “look what you made me do” logic to absolve government intervention.
The virus is not keeping doors shut.   Before any local or federal government orders went into place in the US, several major businesses closed. The NBA cancelled the season. Apple announced all US stores were closed, Disney and Universal closed their theme parks around the country. Even businesses that are allowed to operate as "essential" have closed. Meat processing facilities across the country closed due to high levels of infection among workers, and the Federal Government just ordered them to open.  State and local governments could lift all restrictions today, but nothing will go back to normal until there is a treatment or a vaccine.
Businesses have the right to shut down voluntarily, that's their discretion.  But when the government starts being selective and choosing winners of "who gets to be essential" versus not, destroying livelihoods then that's where I draw the line.  Big retailers like Wal-Mart/Target remain open and can sell anything from art supplies to video games, but arts and craft stores and game retailers are considered "non-essential" and shut down. How is that fair? Simply because they have a grocery aisle?  People can lolligag around in the grocery store for hours on end with hundreds of people inside, but god forbid I want to go to my local barber once a month.  That's why this entire situation is bullshit. It's subjective as hell and would not pass constitutional muster. **Again, this is about choice** and the freedom to choose if you want to go out and work or not. Not be told you cannot and be withheld a paycheck while the government fails to give you any assistance.  We're getting close to a million UI applicants via NCDES from March 15th, and 71% of those people still have yet to receive benefits. Lovely.
Your argument boils down to choice.  You choose to let people die so you can go to work and make money.  There is an opportunity to make money today, right now, for the truly fit. Go to work online and fill your pockets with money. It's 2020, not 1920.
