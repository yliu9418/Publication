use work elementary school start february height flu season instantly get sick talk end first week ill school germ incubator imagine would happen school reopen anytime soon would complete disaster 
dont worry american kid fall behind american kid pretty much country deal issue far education dont disagree kid need socail interaction year child seem like forever earth short time lifespan really small amount time loose year 18 month socail skill building 
city parent 100 blame part global pandemic spread airborne require ppe maintain social distance people seem understand edit reference article frequently use word science link apology advance case anyone trigger 
test adult week start camp 100 isolate test time start camp unless test everyone day camp start isolate outside folk way sure early would wiling bet good contact trace go find thaat one case adult gon na lead case kid might often show symptom get sick dont know anyone say dont carry spread little jonny camp contact adult fine except contacted 5 kid contact 10 parants maybe sibling others get sick keep cycle go 
child one day kind sound like symptom send home part clear article 
kid go day care go school especially young one necessarily polite cough sneeze freeman say really easy disease spread yet report far covid-19 freeman study coronaviruses ph.d say child clearly susceptible know coronaviruses circulate year cold flu season yet something different happen new one article say rate transmission adult fully document ymca keep essential worker kid talk outbreak like nurse home think worth consider also recent article see adult spread kid unlike fear february 
1yr-18 month huge deal young child 
put blast

wife teacher guess straight screwed 
inference inherently flaw one major reason school open kid school course spread much course infection rate low also need stop comparing result hk part asia widespread test contact tracing strong buy cooperation among general public sd mask wear 
nice key point miss country give fuck contain virus unlike country one give shit thousand case add daily 
sure kid likely spread infection unfortunately school generally need adult order function smoothly even though school underfunded few teachers/adult support kid really need learn effectively still lot adult every school build many old female bipoc especially true school least funding also school likely old ineffective hvac system exacerbate likelihood airborne transmission teacher sure might safe kid best kid care education professional 
large organization like cdc say enough data understand impact like transmission symptom kid point find article discuss authority information easily x200b edit find really evidence child drive transmission cycle redfield say white house task force brief address school reopenings enough data definitely arrive conclusion white house health advisor dr deborah birx say later brief wednesday data skew originally people symptoms skew adult 18 look closely category use antibody test birx say

someone ask would hold accountable 1st child dy covid say near statistical impossibility indisputably false happen 38 time since late april definition near statistical impossibility already happen 38 time want place morbid bet child 5 14 die go ahead lose think conflate say likely one specific child 5-14 year old die covid although still statistically impossible sure dig heel wrong want go ask r/askstatistics see agree 
thanks worth think probably great parent listen kid think one important thing parent many people want teach forget kid need heard

think phrase look statistically improbable impossible would even happen let alone 38 time case would say even improbable applies 1 million school even open actually pretty high statistical perspective something like large asteroid capable kill life earth 0.000001 something could say statistically improbable 
still think quite get chance happen multiple time commenter state already happen 38 time go happen lot school across country open go lot likely lightning strike outbreak occur throughout country right handful school open 
think really say think say yes odds specifically get strike lightning year rather low odds someone get strike lightning year however huge difference say likely happen kid likely happen talk thousand million kid talk student die student return school in-person odds happen actually pretty high indeed assume talk thales alone rough math 1 1.079 million odds 3,000 grow enrollment cite 1 360 shot thales kid die covid would call improbable give stake rough math lot variable play include age look like mortality rate high teen mask usage distancing number thales student actually attend person odds calculate also generalize u base current data 5-14 year old 
nope say poster say go concern ability interpret statistic concern read comprehension
