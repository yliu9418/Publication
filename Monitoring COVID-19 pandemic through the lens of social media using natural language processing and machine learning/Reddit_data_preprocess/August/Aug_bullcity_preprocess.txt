haha know would quite career public health expert couple potential well focused intervention workplaces/locations high rate transmission increase mask wear social distance 11pm no-alcohol rule problem potential may wholly responsible drop could zero impact really way know sure data available although say read weekly observation county put might help shed light happen 
guess virus work way vulnerable group either pass away never less not-positive anymore cluster test around first june 
thanks wonder correspond mask mandate way glad stay phase 2 since thing appear work finally nervous return college student 
also worry decline past 2 day bit fake caught whatever test weirdness happen state level might case since sustain decline worry state report unusually low number test apparently hard time get result one provider expect resolve yesterday think bad news one state lead commercial lab late reporting data mean full result likely much high total still unknown tuesday afternoon edit look error impact number positive percent positive seem counter-intuitive explain good news slow transmission appear real 
11pm no-alcohol rule hop new rule drive case particularly young people cooper say median age unemployed worker covid-19 positive 36 construction worker 37 hospital worker 34.5 44 case 25-49 year age booze curfew gon na least helpful thing unless young people mean 18-50 year old wide swath age say combination low herd immunity threshold mask social distance etc driving case durham statewide

lot durham folk work unc let see happens 
duke student move 7th 10th already least week additionally test move part surveillance test since accord find 11 case 
yeah probably one big unknowns moment flip side durham co way duke effect could swamp fact population affect relatively small 
wait see well understand duke approach begin continue well comprehensive unc unc approach best though board governor approach people people involved day day university ever want plan go choice bog bunch trump ball garglers without lot regard actually happen ground university essentially give command deal high duke private make educate decision hamstring appointee stupid as state legislature start way 
college student relative small part durham population expect make vastly disproportionate amount case like saw happen group earlier summer mention much duke student body come northern state get hit earlier anyways good chance many duke student ny nj state may virus already expose fashion 
today first day without hirricane-related dip test right add 20 mind ever since 
easy love see daily case count past 4 week love see trend also thought low test number nationally see effect durham apart hurricane day course 
undergrads many grad student back yet duke 6k undergrad 10k grad student 
may northern think state rank 2018 freshman nc 234 ca 166 ny 153 fl 113 nj 110 tx 92 va 75 ga 64 md 58 il 58 state 50 sc send ct example tn send nh ri de vt combine 
unc saw 120 case matter week sure relative enrollment number two school level increase would represent 20 bump number last 2 week happen durham also think much support last point beyond speculation 
moment flip side durham co way duke effect could swamp fact population affect relatively small downtown durham population something like 20k duke student population 15k city durham return student major impact report plenty maskless pool party apartment complex downtown past week may yet come 
test report today yesterday least state wide quite bit month ago even account monday/tuesday dip report weekend previous 5 day pretty normal though 
sure define dip current period 8/4 8/17 
grad student move away come back housing campus year-long lease grad student know research stuff summer even class assume least grad student durham summer long edit add look like grad student research lab open begin june imagine ton grad student campus 
yeah 3 northern state make top 5 ny nj fl big percentage 
duke 15k student unc 30k town chapel hill 60k people durham 250k though point thread downtown durham population interest one 
downtown durham population something like 20k duke student population 15k city durham return student major impact right look downtown durham lot small proportion wise duke durham county unc orange county though 15,892:321,488 30,011:148,476 use county level data widely available county health department state 
exponential nature contagion also make even small cluster especially area dense downtown duke campus major concern 
maskless pool party unless people also crowd indoors less concern plenty story regard outdoor party turn much like lake ozarks party memorial day cdc say evidence coronavirus spread people pool water proper cleaning chlorine bromine inactivate virus water remember various prediction raceway alamance county thousand stand car race y'all forgot 
ah ok isias hit monday 3rd maybe cusp 
speak law school lot student leave durham either sublet ate cost since class move online last semester end people go home spring come back 
thanks info 
second article coronavirus may spread easily pool water say someone spit big mouthful accidentally almost swallow could still infect people close range head water example group people chat shallow end play pool game may likely acquire virus companion breath saliva e.g shout hear noisy pool water addition pool especially public one contain high-traffic area surface touch often like rail step get pool door enter premise principle social distancing keep people far enough away someone may know infected pas virus another person group people bathrooms lunch line shady indoor area place people come close proximity increase risk pool party still source transmission people hug horse play lounge outside pool chat close proximity witness u/uh_no probably right

record hospitalization figure incorporate simply focus mostly durham co figure would interest see narrative comment section curious 
eventually report usual place residence typically include college student residence scenario bite chain event though positive lab report list mom dad state address report send state home county need investigate tip see state order provider report likely contact student confirm finally send interstate case notification nc get process state health dept assign county health dept 
think two factor 1 few test request young people infect asymptomatic 2 few negative test report large percentage test perform facility require report positive test result e.g walgreens 
problem glad helpful 
few negative test report large percentage test perform facility require report positive test result e.g walgreens purpose behind 
think bit mis-understanding location require report total number test administer state however must report identity behind positive test report county state look like 138 test yesterday name address phone number everyone come back positive know exactly many test administer 
ok make sense thanks explanation
