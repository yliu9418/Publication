daily tar heel bring heat unc administration covid-19 infection 
crazy thing unc release many student 4 cluster say 5 count cluster could 5 could 100 
100 behind overall sentiment reason blame party put thousand people dorm stranger roommates communal bathroom 
hopefully update dashboard today new number last week see many cluster hold breath accurate number update 130 new student case 8/10-8/17 x200b ama student currently quaratine symptom test yet tell test 
unc also get blast today show 
irony unc home one top public health school country 
article look even well print 
curious thing go duke state 
130 unc student test positive 13.5 rate 
absolute mess exactly everyone expect would happen 
though student faultless university responsibility disincentivize gathering reconsider plan operate in-person earlier reason bog look avenue gut fund usual dth incapable look issue outside perspective right issue cut dry administration continue prove shame bar basic decency keep get low juvenile ignorant statement surprising experience j-school dth board sad see unc one bad student paper country angry scar tired gaslighting tire secrecy tire treat like cash cow university blatant disregard live come back transfer somewhere take gap year stop ignoring reality ferpa handwaving away many people say release info also jesus fuck equate endowment something chancellor total control say thing complicate unc make seem absolutely stupid take edit also surround big issue loom funding cut chancellor absolutely powerless sure dth board absolutely zero research posting 
unc covid dashboard say free space two covid dorm le 5 capacity know many student cluster collectively lot run space two dorm building quickly rumor put overflow sick hotel area 
ferpa exist unc say much dth respond many people say release info ignore privacy aspect hard implement limit population 
political party party party 
update minute ago 130 new case among student last week 13.6 positive rate well 5 target plenty undetected case well 
ironic yes gillings say whether unc reopen faculty staff give input share feeling go remote reopen final say whole university reopen 91 remote plan 9 go remote well 
weird change title 
hi ncsu student apartment friend dorms somewhat speak situation campus two dorm part quarantine already news come people know dorms people still party sigma nu forgive wrong frat big one last week video surface think matter time unc system school shut many people party come back crowd dorm 
duke test student single week unc almost summer far report cluster outbreak 
state parent teach ncsu apparently 4 report positive test do student health require disclose however also campus wide policy want absolutely get test covid student health elsewhere lie damn lie blatant manipulation statistic 
editorial board recognize decision transition away in-person class one ultimately lie board governor administration even admit 
school open person like student bite silly say could u like everyone knew would happen one thought unc reopen fully smart student make choice go back information scream bad idea way school reopen smart way clear jump everyone make bad decision 
ferpa 100 apply aggregate number cluster location issue remove thing could possibly put ferpa create damn dashboard stuff go claim ferpa thing look bad hell even make dashboard source deal shit everyday much sensitive situation 
ferpa anyone wonder 
yeah release name sure hell say many people want kid ssn want know many positive case campus right 
party party editorial attempt find common ground unc administration note student blameless big house party definitely stupid thing right nowhere close dumb unnecessarily put people communal housing 
94.5 quarantine room full mean probably full capacity since number take today account 
bog sole authority determine yep 
online version yes 
unc sigma nu one cluster maybe national organization need intervene 
understand 4 total positive case return student immediately isolate also continued test asymptomatic people use technique call pool test extend number people test likely lowering sensitivity somewhat honestly sort seem like nationwide guess ca afford something 
wild right whole op-ed seem serve angry undergrad primal scream therapy 
certainly unc could handle good say bog salivate excuse say see spent xyz go fully online v person mean gon na cut budget 50 become far less black white balance opening hopefully retain budget v prevent spread 50 cut long lasting harm state also many student whose home live also utterly horrify student might better campus hole dorm room yeah may get covid youth number moment look like long lasting effect mortality rate around flu 242 people age 14-24 die covid country say trust wo spread vulnerable population unc absolutely spent summer plan punish violator separate student physically well say hard problem solve op-ed lacked nuance essentially write form sling shit someone 
ferpa 100 apply lawyer assume unc number lawyer look stuff claim come yes single gross case count something lots school communicate stand reason ferpa apply specific context fortunately unc provide number 149 student dth really due diligence give dashboard get updated workweek reason doubt push recent cluster today edit predict dashboard updated recent cluster yet dth self-owns 
sure hell say many people dashboard 
see way round personally put people communal housing becomes lot dangerous people ca trust throw party 
yes unfortunately stopped people send dean faculty nasty message ask stop unc opening 
sure e-house hojo granville sigma nu plus free space get bingo 
duke assuredly throw ungodly amount money enable level test something unc system school easily without support legislature ga partially shot show begin even 100 sure campus health actually test analyzed uncmc instead send labcorp another offsite lab would explain extreme delay test result uncmc still return result 24 hour 
additionally student complete symptom monitoring lead restrict build access card think ongoing pool test intend eventually ramp test student weekly pool test cheap saliva test protocol approve fda last week amount test 4 rather 100 per test let test multiple sample re-test positive pinpoint positive individual 
lawyer work counsel across unc ch unc system unc health duke university nih establish legal contract dictate use pii phi well internal system security requirement store ferpa hipaa classify data also finger every human subject research study unc ch use emr data think know wtf talk edit realize also include publishing protect data journal public domain website different section contract cover data research team analyst access result say analysis matter circumstance result raw data covet ferpa hipaa 
communal housing dorm typically mean share living space among large group people share shower bathroom kitchen live room elevator door handle etc hundred thousand student communal living pretty similar university throw large party every day edit reference roughly 8,000 undergrad live dorm unc across 14 community 571 student per community spread evenly like giant party every day 14 different community even consider risky behavior young adult prone engage way contain pandemic condition 
wonderfully nuanced article thread haha agree 
know number duke probably right certain pool test strategy bet could pull unc less cost short term inconvenience perhaps slow open happen unc right 100 bullshit bog ga blame everyone piss 
nih establish legal contract dictate use pii phi well internal system security requirement store ferpa hipaa classify data someone work analytic software dealt contract government police force school hospital etc also send shit legal time dictate protocol use security posture etc pii neither u lawyer neither u privy challenge school face specific instance sits publish gross case count edit love reddit non-lawyers take legal issue tantamount talk lawyer know talk serf expert advice 
think point make bubble theory isolate school problem bubble let people congregate 
definitely bubble invite 30,000 people campus in-person mistake student local employee grocery store restaurant transportation every service come contact suffer
