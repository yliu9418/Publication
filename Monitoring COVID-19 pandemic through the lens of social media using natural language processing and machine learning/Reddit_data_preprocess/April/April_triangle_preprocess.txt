senator let first say really appreciate concern tighten test requirement test people seriously ill company like labcorp area think would capable ramp force slow effectively lose information could use fight virus project come next imagine request federal government aide weight number case state deal currently rightfully x200b also concern test turn around time love one work hospital test patient take 7 day come back wear limited ppe supply already become issue x200b hopefully wrong feel like increase test would allow u access supply fund federal government give u good understand virus allow u know direct contact monitor closely bring spread halt

thank much constant update 
may bottom people mind car property tax payment due end may way go get inspection right unless way without leave car let anyone else plan give extension stuff like would happy pay forgo inspection may know option 
appreciate effort format presentation post 
thanks share number prediction u saw news article bay area ca make really good progress term infection rate due compliance shelter place order hopefully great see projection hopeful rather bleak perhaps little frighten hear plan c immunocompromised person hope get ok look forward no-nonsense update 
senator thank continued update point think enforcement people take situation seriously enough number regard capacity somewhat encouraging beneficial recommend stricter guideline example one person per household gather essential item need someone household show symptom plan place person quarantine also would helpful inform people severe case actually happen case person need ventilator get point across virus nothing like people see cause panic inform people risk face become complacent 
u/jeffjacksonnc ask run president need thank provide clear concise honest data 
get pitchfork shake federal government yet 
graph look pretty damn linear past week sayin 
absolutely right everyone agree definitely increase test capacity wo time flatten curve social distancing plan b plan c 
usually get inspected pay property tax whenever get around doubt ever pay time think penalty harsh pay property tax late 
get one wife car growl 
boat mine end month 
likewise fail first one ca get fixed 2 day ago run expire tag ncdot tell luck recommend get inspection safely pay tax ca successfully complete inspection tell require meeting general assembly appear happen anything pas would retroactive like waive late fee ticket receive expire tag etc 
agree 
senator claim south korea test way reconcile fact test 0.6 population success really anything test availability could achieve result state government act sooner rather sit around two month accuse federal government racism 
stay safe unless pay tax whatever take thanks government 
south korea able test everyone symptoms matter never even symptom negative flu test still get test 
news medium widely report 50 infected asymptomatic frankly doubt number much deal yet another blow theory south korea test way thus crisis entirely fault federal government test symptom virus continue spread due asymptomatic true relevant difference south korea nc former spend two month clutch pearl point finger 
get impression senator mean simply state fact test kit go time follow model korea use different strategy 
news medium widely report 50 infected asymptomatic think get opinion make use news know number come moreover stuck logical fallacy infection rate flat line sk test 0.6 need early game find infected slow/stop spread would equivalent every state test test find outbreak ny wa february entirely federal government fault
