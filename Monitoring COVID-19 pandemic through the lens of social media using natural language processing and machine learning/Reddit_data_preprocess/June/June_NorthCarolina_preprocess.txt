nc consistently top 10 come new covid-19 case 
news nc top 10 state total population say problem simplest total show really go 
place nc case death per 1m graph 
north carolina also steadily ramp test naturally go find case link source photo love see nc rank term percent positive test number test number death death compare total population percentage positive test seem like much good indication state controlling/surviving virus 
memorial day weekend infection even show yet even final form 
yay oh wait 
well course see full ppl community swim pool basketball court duh expect 
new death go see track coronavirus curve nc chart 11:15 a.m north carolina double number coronavirus test administer may compare month april 128,517 test give may 287,772 test percentage positive test remain steady 6.9 double number test number patient hospitalize covid-19 jump 66 716 information come 89 hospital report data tuesday compare 75 monday state official say 77 ventilator available 27 hospital bed 20 intensive care bed available sign state healthcare system room accommodate new covid-19 patient spike case occur hospital report number explain increase hospitalization also report capacity deal future surge would nice y'all give complete picture various covid post 
yet 1,008 covid relate death population 10,000,000 
would take one statistic consideration 
reopen nc 
normalize 
uh yeah massive problem new case new york california massively large population number new case per population dumb people math real good one reason state damn pathetic 
97 death per mill 
source 
sorry absolutely feel sad process natural selection un-happy mob moron literally die result moron 
positive gradually increase little 9 think last time percentage positive downward trend mid may every day reset 14 day counter since 
uh yeah massive problem new case new york california massively large population oddly enough click source link california currently 1 3600 new case new york 4 1464 new case nc 6 1220 new case suppose massive problem maybe issue post 2 pm est 11 ca report number yet number new case per population dumb people math real good one reason state damn pathetic post mention new case per population mention total new case nc top 10 consistently give nc rank 9 u population surprise could top 10 new covid-19 case maybe someone post thing regard new case per caput could call people dumb refer state pathetic however absence one present poorly jump conclusion resort insult immediately productive make north carolinian look good 
thanks actually put nc favourable light compare selective statistic gather photo nc number 11 total test administer naturally go find case test people way list term deaths per million people say couldn't/should op make sound like comparatively bad data make look like comparatively good also bottom half look total case adjust per million resident course total case remain function total test actual case still show overall tweak data hard make look like nc bad rest country 
dumb people also read real good either new case new york california 
really see point unless read good 
word critical 
nc covid-19 case peak third day row complete test near 500,000 
course see ppl hang w/o mask basketball court pool bar restaurant etc increase number test ppl start ignore covid-19 
ever since phase 2 people walk around act like virus longer exist surprise 
important miss statistic non-covid death compare 10 year average apparently non covid pneumonia death like 500 average also apparently lot death get report patient consider non resident death get report 
greatly increase test number positive case increase know test asymptotic people low prevalence population give u 25-50 false positive result 
doubt test really increase large majority new case still close big city like charlotte raleigh although closed aspect personal choice 
patient consider non resident death get report true jurisdiction residence notify death report 
source pneumonia death 
number really matter hospitalization icu bed/ventilator availability imo 
percentage positive increase downtrended since memorial day everything okay percentage positive would increase test 
quote dr birx say response push test cite chinese science paper test paper redact science journal publish 
phenomenon describe false positivity really issue low cost broadly administer serology i.e antibody test part test strategy covid-19 case definition however academic partner state perform sero-surveys well estimate background prevalence test quote tracked state pcr test detect amplify sars-2 rna present sample extremely specific high positive predictive value 
positive rate asymptomatic pre op patient major hospital triangle le 1 whereas last week symptomatic patient test positive 10 rate anything test asymptomatic patient increase denominator push overall rate 
know hospital report jurisdiction jurisdiction protocol include report expatriate death 
handy google pneumonia death average 2020 find many think u/prizedturkey tell first 
climb hospitalization climb since may 5th icu utilization 85 icu usage usually high expensive make sense keep full many place provide ventilator use data present state death still climb well medium move new hotness day mean covid go away 
sure saw previous post point make test asymptotic people increase number false positive increase easily explain less 1 increase positive real underlying increase actual positive 
bayes theorem molecular base test available u specificity around 96 prevalence 5 get 35 false positive result 
activity standard covid reporting rely hospital county state coordinate routine source intimately involved state covid report say protocol lab confirm covid case covid-related mortality among people without lab confirm infection may well under-ascertained 
explain number hospitalization go 
test change percentage 
know whether say accurate even applies absolute number infection rate unchanged percentage positive decrease increased testing number 
whole conversation concern strictly non confirm likely covid death vastly underreported report mechanism standard mean accurate best mechanism lack national coordination one great shortcoming highlight whole thing 
idk someone answer question number jump 700 news say 14 hospital start report number 
attempt attribute upward trend statistical noise next goal post course positive test 
great article bay theorem explain intuitive work example see change prevalence specificity 
venture say capacity identify novel coronavirus infection associate morbidity mortality much strong even 2 month ago due well logistical capacity knowledge general awareness among health community public foundational thing improve downstream reporting 
capacity ne execution certainly today plety report death could well covid positive test plenty death show anywhere source doc good friend unc hospital nc capture death hospital 
nc capture deaths hospital collect local health department 
record 739 hospitalize covid-19 nc case surge across country 
guy hear covid get bored 
go back office june 1 lem tell ya one wear mask people seem bother 6-ft social distance gon na let happen u think 
think saw something news last night nc meet phase 3 reopen threshold something number 10 phase 3 require 6 cross buzzing really focus 
yet soooo many people really need gym strip club bar open ugh number go keep climb unfortunately especially protest lately 
happens reopen early moron hope enjoy brief restaurant haircut 
increased infection rate tend happen group hundred people regularly convene close proximity around state people need stop act like negative protest long nonviolent 
739 10 million nc 
4 current hospitalization state accord data 
article go back school look number title tdidnt see 
meet today people spout kind shit virus dangerous spoke say guess exception rule fuck hell man 
boomer haircuts applebees right world 
curious pretty vocal take seriously conservative try downplay one vocal conservative subreddit republican response change view dm response prefer 
think right 
nc never meet phase 2 threshold either open anyway two week memorial day spike nc even reach peak infection yet 
cue influx comment increase test false number bizarre math theory order keep change narrative move goal post 
soooo many people really need gym yeah u badly part mental health regimen simply achieve workout bodyweight run heavy weight lift ca type business open reduce capacity wipe equipment social distancing etc etc etc gym 
early re-opening 
right support cause protest irresponsible protesting loss one life cost ten thousand 
also accord data 739 77 hospital report 461 icu bed available possible 3,223 14 available 4244 inpatient hospital bed available 17204 25 available flatten curve mean overwhelming hospital exhaust every resource 
halfway article number people hospitalize covid-like symptom across north carolina reach new high monday state report 739 people hospital high one-day total since coronavirus pandemic begin 
opinion protestors social distancing 
notice call protester gather thousand every single day protest police brutality undoubtedly spread virus know pb way justify want get haircut go eat corona virus care cause still spread mention haircut applebee thats virus spread ignorant 
millennial 
well first republican know say conservative agree want make distinction clear anyone read party loyalty critical republican ton stuff last decade vote trump 2016 wo vote 2020 secondly yes extremely disappointed countless politician top issue address handle politicized disappointment bound political party either disappointed president congressional senate rep governor ga honestly feel like could time unity could set aside difference combat common enemy much like wartime maybe week seem like could case hope come crash pretty quickly pledge vote incumbent state federal level november prior happen still plan sad state hyper-partisanship ca even come together crisis like honestly fear future 
truth pick metric stick 
make two different point 1 exercise necessary mental health 2 achieve workout bodyweight run heavy weight lift 1 legitimately debate anyone benefit clear prevent exercise even pandemic 2 relevant perfectly clear mental health optimize run bodyweight training make pretty clear mental health benefit pronounce low-to-moderate intensity resistance training benefit high intensity training include heavy lifting say difference 2 7 day per week light heavy lifting important part workout intensity source say thing source source seem disagree insofar indicate prolong rest period might dampen quantifiable benefit strength training aerobic activity pack work time period balance public policy maker perspective mental health outcome achieve people restrict work home physical health outcome also improve people restrict work home no-brainer except term perceive importance exact nature exercise individual affect closure aggregate perspective make sense protect health many even mean inconvenience power lifter process edit add analogy ca get quality workout home equally irrelevant discussion ca get quality food home work important food still make particular argument salient scenario 
protest loss one life come nearly every protester wear mask 
thanks 
almost thing important protest also mention protester generally wear mask unlike reopen people 
almost protester wear mask public make huge difference 
know 
vote incumbent mean vote forest cooper forest say thing like know still death flu year covid-19 forest say add three time deaths hiv/aids remember pandemic one tiwme still vaccine one bad obviously bad normal flu year hit extreme pandemic yet mandate devastate economy shutter many small business leave many people unemployed especially rural area state food supply already critical say news release moral ethical rational justification policy slow-walks return post-pandemic normal covid-19 kill already illnesses justification shut state economy protect live seem forest would rather go route florida georgia nothing think cooper proactive enough fair assessment try understand view edit agree politicize seem science political interpretation though debated able test quickly small scale something like global warming 
governor staff consistent message one metric consider exclusion others say hospitalization one concern today press conference emphasize number hospital icus particular become overwhelm trouble 
muh rep 
sound like scared cardio 
right one life still outweigh loss life see million choose group together multiple day mask one small part defense virus one important proper hygiene think protester spend day street able properly wash hand 
really almost wear mask mean sure lot wear reopen people still find hard believe 
almost probably 65/35 wear mask cause see even 100 wear mask 2 inch apart people crowd still much much bad stay home record think protest good thing think want open business good thing bad come spread virus anyone think one okay ignorant 
brevard white squirrel 
forest cooper one ballot vote steven difiore libertarian candidate nc governor realize mostly protest vote likelihood elect essentially zero simply come term support either forest cooper culpable current condition state 
new infection would say lead indicator hospitalization 
right great situation wish need 
every protest organization flyer post see always say wear mask sure look like ton mask 
mean protest support health safety surely much stretch think would slip bit cloth protect others 
say least 80-90 people wear masks protest attend though sometimes people pull bit anecdotal though 
hmm 
true reliable way measure new infection new positive test result factor number test do may reflect new case may reveal otherwise undetected case percent positive well number still subject skewed test distribute even percent positive hover 7 10 percent hospitalization rise actually test everyone make educate guess base number 
pretty good well expect think closer 60-70 base picture 
like yuuuummmmmm amirite 
hospitalization go stand reason toward 10 possibly breach number 
want emphasize entirely anecdotal greensboro might mask coverage protest city 
10 known number guess whether breached number positive test comparison test process day actually 10 back april march hover right 10 line lately could go high time 
may anecdotal seem lot reasonable likely people act like every protestor wear mask totally support cause way true 
ahhh see mean north carolina see protest start opennc think right present make sense close 10 hopefully high surprise thank clarification

north carolina hospitalization coronavirus continue grow state hit record high hospitalization tuesday 774 people currently hospital severe covid-19 symptom 35 number report monday setting record fourth time june 
expect goal prevent hospital overwhelm still close 
case actually drop dramatically yesterday mean wo go positive number 6/9 
approximately 0.000774 population 
still people 774 actually 
white house concern nc lack covid-19 testing 
joke white house lose right concern long ago 
dr birx trump stooge wrong fair single nc probably doubt tell state anything already understand however test need move phase reactive covid-19 lose preventative social distancing business closure 
put blame squarely gop try every turn open state even cooper everything keep state close reopen safely look legislation push senate gop 
test lot people average state 
mcpresident concerned medium induce hoax doofus worshipper start die drove need way distort fact deflect blame gaslight obstruct project gop mcpresident crony stand make argument whatsoever regard pandemic meanwhile mcpresident busy contaminate test 
lmao wow 
bcuz cooper care want u shutdown till november 
case actually drop dramatically yesterday mean wo go positive number 6/9 
original plan 30 day slow spread hospital overwhelm overwhelmed right reopen stay close forever destroy economy think notice unemployment benefit last forever lots people run go back work live government socialism work live dude 
average state u test total 67,871 per million people nc test 52,788 per million people overall less average number per day go almost 3 fold past month 
november 
think point value lie trend line metric 
briefly glance chart look like tuesday low number report 
would get hung daily report good metric measure trend besides infection rate 1 piece puzzle miss lot test one really matter 
want get elect doubt win point 
look total test well yesterday high number 
yeah mostly follow wapo number last day good one horrendous start relax actual trend line start look good 
every poll say otherwise currently margin big wrong 
approval rating basically flat start though take small dip veto would erode power manage crisis generally increase prior 
well guess move south carolina freedom socialism dictatorship 
well get re-elected probably keep bar gyms close forever dictator 
yeah fun 
yes please take moronic comment r/southcarolina well 
make strong argument maybe future news moderator come soon 
hospital official say ready number covid-19 case continue rise 
gotten lose shutdown prepare hospital large intake although major component major component shutdown strategy country anyways use time drastically increase production test capability create robust contact trace process country half assed job best shutdown come back bite u crucial get second half shutdown strategy place minimum 2 week behind outbreaks occur bad 
number people hospitalize state new high bed fill across state expert say expect state reopen protest happen prepared case follow think point initial lockdown prepare hospital thing hospital say ready duke wakemed unc hospital continue see new patient three hospital say plenty capacity state begin reopen light recent protest three hospital expect see case really far away see hospital get capacity level term bed icu bed ventilator duke say confused medium others message keep see report rise hospitalization hospital sufficient capacity page reopen early may hospital would stay empty long supposed keep normal capacity know various funding issue well sure much federal aid go keep afloat 
point time 84 percent hospital report expert say still good shape see spike amaze really goal post move do half-assed job so-called shut overwhelming hospital indefinitely happy 800-1000 people die every day long hospital cope usa give fight virus move thing american attention span measure hour anyway perhaps miracle people still concern virus strategy give wait 56 population die herd immunity kick everything usa shit really amazing country could focus mobilize put man eff moon ca well slovakia lebanon come protect citizen virus even month prepare squander seriously country total shit rich rob everyone blind hit fan 
point time 84 percent hospital report expert say still good shape see spike think safely return normal precaution would let record number scare fact reopen point deal thing best 
article fail mention case drop dramatically yesterday percent positive drop also 6/9 
increase production test capability ca speak contact trace nc dramatically increase test capacity past week state dramatically increase test drive-thru event partnership retail chain castlight company partner north carolina track test location find may 14 21 county north carolina testing site county access test 1 5 meeting recommend test minimum week study north carolina flip status reporting few county nation access test castlight find 90 county test site majority able meet recommend test minimum 
incorrect also think probably prominent story due fact even though increase expect prepared still mean impact people live loss life well also fear preparation still enough somewhat uncharted territory 
probably many people still alive experienced great influenza 1918/1919 reference point 
original state goal buy time hospital prepare move goal post happen earlier people decide aim eradication u return original state goal lockdown 
day test variance look graph anything smooth repeat pattern spike dip use 7 day average say drop one day disingenuous best 
graph/data appear indicate steadily rise infection trend period 3 month large group infect white people age 25-49 interesting worth note take action prevent spread rate would even worse improbable infection rate decrease point average give many people ignore force give social distancing etc give data available appear go get much bad 
read wisconsin open remember videos packed bar 
look like case go today compare last wednesday reading right 
true greatly increase test test do depend test get 2-5 day lag result test effective use information contact trace actually proactive outbreak occur need able test someone get result within matter hour day event positive test need able inform people could expose part shutdown strategy necessitates coordinate national effort part federal government seem something expect see anytime soon change fact unless capability outline always go react outbreak instead proactive 
leave three large hospital system nc ready take patient unlikely say hospital system dare county never could take covid patient would ready yes duke unc wake take additional patient highly concern hospital int state cant 
glass half empty person try make something positive keep 
steadily rise infection trend period 3 month appear go get much bad iirc begin fear hockey stick-like infection/hospitalization rate lockdown flatten curve gentle slop increase rate think goal 
young white make sense give one reopen state work go place least group likely milder symptom 
except others say wisconsin georgia lag indicator quite high could soon see spike case additionally dynamic wisconsin quite different nc half population much less travel whereas somewhere like arizona high population old population one lot travel ask hospital engage emergency plan get close hospital overwhelm covid case almost like many thing u since one unified homogeneous country shore shore individual state plan massive effect outcomes virus along people adhere plan 
june 3 888 case today 1,011 
also valid point small hospital sometimes struggle best time

next covid-19 phase update cooper date 
wonder anyone heard plan hold conference announce next step state whether go phase 1/phase 2.5 phase 3 yet historically speak updates tends announce plan wednesday business 48 hour plan implementation.thanks advance info.edit answered question accord nc_governors twitter plan announce plan today appear 3pm est link 
probably sort mask order though cautious want legislature overturn 
shock move forward would surprise go back phase 1 
fully expect mask order legit low effort policy would yield tangible result 
way go backwards term reclosing place people already tired restriction tell place shut reopen would political suicide 
would surprise honestly go back phase 1 even though ideal world would stricter lockdown first place current extension unemployment benefit small business aid past july 31st sadly likely either move modify phase 2 phase 3 state mandate facemasks want blame someone increase covid-19 case blame anti-intellectual folk raise hell get nails hair blame restaurant brewery church lobby opened phase 2 clearly practice proper social distancing require facemasks conjunction retail outlet relax safety standard across state blame folk clearly realize clearly bad idea go beach 
agree wo back phase 1 till september 
think produce result folk wo wear mask find workarounds head rural area wo enforce anything wear one business accept business order stay afloat anything death might go burden shift rural area 
already signal enforcement know suggestion 
blame folk clearly realize clearly bad idea go beach bad idea go beach outdoor transmission covid negligible go get covid walk somebody beach 
want blame someone increase covid-19 case could blame state government silent racial disparity mid-june make 14,000 positive case 44 nearly 30,000 case ethnicity know accord state health official dramatic overrepresentation infection since latino 9.3 state population respectfully believe state government keep data public way stigma blame put latino say dr viviana martinez-bianchi spanish serf state marginalize population task force duke doctor time problem necessary protect community data nail hair blame restaurant brewery church see place outside minority neighborhood responsible vast over-representation covid case within latino community state wide 
think result proportional population density large population center least slow stabilize rate new covid-19 case rural area wan na stick head ground follow data-driven common sense thats natural selection 
beach problem shop around beach people shop without distance wear mask problem even dare county announce masks mandatory people wear inside store 
work people social distance sit within arm reach suntanning extend period time 
unless really crowd beach people go close extended period time people specifically go stranger admittedly turn bad idea gather large group together go beach family maybe small group friend hang isolate otherwise totally fine certainly bad place could hang possible exception public bathroom situation 
remote opportunity fellow redditors lay due covid-19 
unc faculty graduate student point racism classism university decision re-open amid covid-19 
ridiculous college reopen small chance student die disease school put place multiple safe guard help protect student staff coronavirus also school crack racism faculty student classism issue either stay college allows low income group stay away old vulnerable family member 
small chance still chance importantly large chance student faculty bring something home infect at-risk individual home still thousand die day thousand hurry increase number stay lockdown much along also everyone afford on-campus housing say b.s work b.e work full time nine year school could afford live on-campus expensive assuming option everyone show far disconnect actually 
student discourage travel campus home get rid fall break holiday also student person class faculty protect student barrier class room college student least likely die mean good get creat immunity age also lockdown never mean stop spread slow people go die disease afford campus housing work summer save rent apartment around college meant campus mean area around campus fault clarify good get disease live place house family 
think part concern student islands away family administration din housekeep course registration record park building maintenance ground keep security mail etc make people whose in-person work become compulsory handle student protection put place university go maintained staff face variety condition support maintain campus operation must return home family even choice accommodation high-risk individual business need business need trump accommodation people go die line let thousand student country converge one space travel wherever however often do way reason 
house keep dinning one see reason talk interact student already put thing place society minimize risk suck face mask glove din hall limited capacity shield student rest job list do mostly online exception ground keep little student interaction outside think healthy willing risk get sick little chance die think able go back college worth eye take semester learn best class room interact teacher student especially labs wan na hurt gpa slow education disease little impact others feel way take year problem people get start live back one stay lock home forever 
good list want 
thanks share additionally though student faculty flow building different class different administrative need wander use bathroom ask direction use library buy supply etc mask mitigate risk compliance become big issue enforcement anyone wear mask especially student go clean-cut unless behind plastic barrier time go take one asymptomatic student argue without mask escalate situation see collective concern burden effort faculty staff less ability take year reluctant return full operation 
pit student faculty staff different side though example could non-compliant staff member argue student concern come back 
well think student concern come back would talk online doubt would wan na could schedule person meet something like 
yeah think class go offer online random run-in situation mention 
wear mask social distance like run someone know randomly 
remote opportunity fellow redditors lay due covid-19 
alley without exit expert worry covid-19 among latinos get dire without support 
mid-june make 14,000 positive case 44 nearly 30,000 case ethnicity know accord state health official dramatic overrepresentation infection since latino 9.3 state population respectfully believe state government keep data public way stigma blame put latino say dr viviana martinez-bianchi spanish serf state marginalize population task force duke doctor time problem necessary protect community data 
worst wear mask social distance personal observation 
know stay home irma tell news observer enlace latino nc interview community like difficult must work whatever cost yeah one else race problem still stay home 
fair think group probably equally bad mask social distance less bad general lack attention government medium address population super over-represented covid case like 14 population durham county almost 75 guess folk stay homer want blame hair salon beach brewery tattoo/nail shop rise case nc without look closely demographic data easier blame hair salons/breweries spread covid instead address unique challenge community disproportionately impact virus 
easy however blame area lot people shove close area low pay little health care option like meat plant big rise case covid eastern county nc one wh currently worry due meat plant wonder work meat plant people go salon brewery grocery store spread disease easily figure keep people apart wear mask go never end cycle covid spike local shutdown 
well aware housing situation well 
family test positive coronavirus today careful 
bad news today safe guy start feel like thing normal wake call orange county area father 55 past smoker really worried yeah safe guy please still take seriously

protest important forget pandemic go still thing say article worrisome 89 percent hospital report statewide inpatient bed 76 percent capacity intensive-care bed 85 percent accord state dhhs everyone need try best mind social distance face mask wash hand often 
wish bunker could hide 
really worrisome hospital typically run 70 90 capacity bed icu bed high percentage under-served area like typical day hospital icu 2 full make sense equipment space incredibly expensive 
also notice hospitalization ventilator use pretty much hold steady icu use increase past week kind strange sure riot contribute icu use though 
nc hit new high daily new case coronavirus 
number continue rise time result infection test idiot fail basic prevent spread disease 
much likely reopen stuff racetrack stuff protest stuff go next week spike least one cause haircuts minor league auto racing 
headline alarmist percent positive remain 7 shit go find case test people giant graph link show actually low percent positive month ago 
imagine 
pikachuface.jpeg 
bit alarm hospitalization per day trend since 5/10 suppose enter phase iii number case come two week happen yet hospitalization go two week happen yet small overall percentage north carolinian infect far number keep eye currently easily top 10 state u new case per day 
actually accurate say 8.5-9.5 7 area since 5/19

presymptomatic spread rare 
since clarify statement cdc also estimate 40 coronavirus transmission occur people feel sick meaning presymptomatic fucking terrible science communication 
also gain customer protect customer 
thanks insight another record high today joy 
mean agree nc legal recently one working taillight even case make scotus 
yeah lot place open back way early people protest quarantine order nowhere near legitimate blm protest put pressure local government ridiculous 
look western europe continue new case new zealand come close also tiny population far country scatter across number island 
way personally majority population prove take personal responsibility role really need mandate 
case care elaborate provide source assertions case drop new york minnesota home big outdoor protest source lack outdoor spread transmission coronavirus 20x low outdoor setting viral load lower small droplet aerosol poorly ventilate space sars-cov-2 
curious point care elaborate 
quite clearly oxygen deprive squid 
agree trump could set good example power combat virus much state responsibility trump use power pulpit purse largely ton fed directly 
potus want close travel effect area dems fight want re-open next stimulus bill give 2 shit u nothing pawns political bullshit 
stay home order like power federal government 
manpower unconstitutional hate say liberal medium control country anything 
right bad thing happen kill 
say anything related mask hell think wear mask pure courtesy every single flu season think death flu could prevent 
force stay home response another redditors comment complain governor force people stay home somewhere thread weird question fire black people burn house sure brain go yes could thing pay consequence like go pandemic know risk make choice say 
conspiracy theory work hospital legit get money say covid death certificate even cause death factor cert liberal always say something fox watch fox notice people mention liberal really weird argument watch number high rat cable news channel argument try prove strange liberal never say docs kill people purposely ridiculous funny rely cdc data cdc originally say death rate would upwards 7 0.5 ever less age 70 ok bud whatever say want keep drinking kool-aid go right ahead 
interesting article bay area real statistic available anecdotal best could hope article paint pretty bleak picture doctor john muir medical center walnut creek say see death suicide quarantine period death covid-19 never see number like short period time say mean see year worth suicide attempt last four week 
unfortunately scientist market guru often cross path 
oh misunderstand word correctly asymptomatic presymptomatic carrier absolutely spread virus responsible less 40 infection point person post want wear mask post believe catch virus people show symptoms people refuse believe science hard convince thing like wear mask 
yeah look good state brighter note always happy provide insight healthcare/public health research people understand go much researcher care work people adhere help spread recommendation next time something like come around 
actually one work brake light tail light difference motor vehicle motorcycle motor-driven cycle manufacture december 31 1955 operated street highway north carolina must equip stop lamp rear vehicle stop lamp must display red amber light visible least 100 foot rear normal sunlight also never heard updated law problem come car share tail light brake light supreme court decide cop act good faith stop car court rule previously brake light tail light thing reasonable thing police know law saw differently edit never mind find 
many pd state longer allow cop enforce law use harass minority greensboro particular 
become openly defiant instead mask usage go especially rural area folk start shop rural area south carolina get around think work margin keep encouraging maybe make mandatory state-owned place like university happen try force unwilling population already hat create powder keg throw thing unwilling unable enforce virginia cooper suggest folk get defiant mask usage go 
transmission le fair say spread outdoors 
get source see people push back idea travel ban health really believe travel ban effective stem rate spread incidentally exactly thing say ebola sound like conflate trump immigration travel coronavirus travel ban news coverage go time democrat push back ban mainly nonsensical security theater mean pander base find evidence democrat push back coronavirus travel ban 
source 
lol 
unclear certainly line high modern hellworld article social distancing pandemic would prevent national plan 
reasonable thing police know law saw differently maybe reasonable police know actual fucking law 
wish could understand uncomfortable deny help everyone around stay healthy depend upon read may help little lot make sense people would willing put others risk uncomfortable 
ignore response confirm argument get money covid patient good valid reason correlation rest nonsense creator theory simply saw fact get covid completely ignore rest fact 
disagree paraphrase judgment although knew law well probably lawyer legislator instead cop 
feel little risk also real deep issue worry become permanent new normal feel worth live mask actually would rather take chance get ta remember lot folk think really think life worth live much 
meant felt need say general 
think understand concern/fear compliance may become permanent last sentence break heart 
one north carolina hospital coronavirus outbreak feel like begin 
coronavirus emerge united state winter hospital north carolina prepare sharp increase patient sicken respiratory illness fear surge patient could fill emergency room intensive care unit place italy new york public health hospital official say statewide stay-at-home order step keep people physically apart work flatten curve prevent sharp spike covid-19 case virus go away north carolina midst slow steady surge covid-19 case say dr shannon carson chief pulmonary disease critical care medicine unc look like initial lock down prepare hospital ongoing rise case play happen nothing article indicate hospital prepare happen contrast say couple month ago 
news observer drop free corona virus coverage 
except part weekend unc medical center chapel hill fill 22 bed currently set aside covid-19 patient medical intensive care unit slip back 20 week worry bed full additional patient especially icu set become triaged mean docs suddenly make decision get 100 care get less care county area without preparation say dare county many hospital nc without icu patient place somewhere else article state time prep covid best prevention would need bed begin 
one million bed total america one million total bed every cancer ward birth ward icu bed picu bed em one million far fine folk right exactly zero 
say bed full say bed specifically reserve covid full anymore still icu bed 
mean would use bed specifically reserve covid agree everyone start wear mask 
yes mean chance exposure non-isolated ward increase 
coronavirus case u.s evolution 15 state case 1 march 16 june 
call come back 
north carolina set another one-day high report coronavirus hospitalization 
make nc wear facemasks california already want thing open way 
felt like almost non-maskers wear maga hat lol correlation political belief 
mah freedom nonsense like virus personally affect anyone close therefore viable risk consider remote threat somehow inexplicably exist therefore need mask adhere guideline people take lift restriction insist upon go back normal come price pay piper always come matter morbid melancholy cost trend worrisome go end another hotspot like ny careful amount selfishness display tell ever pandemic arises severity mortality rate far high covid dead infect fictional reference people wonder asymptomatic virus reanimate dead unless bitten case symptomatic beforehand whatever could overwhelm society wildfire virus answer lie simply view action others see happen 
hospitalization 1 increase previous day 67 month ago 6/18 nc dhhs fb page today number show yet another high day 1,300 new case percent positive test 9 statewide hospitalization 857 think 10 percent positive test rate 6/13 north carolina record 1,768 covid-19 case match 10 percent high test come back positive saw small dip hospitalization four straight day record number 
would curious know age hospitalization saw texas quarter people hospitalize covid 20 
people reluctant wear mask 
lol conservative might make big deal drive around large metro area become obvious quickly bipartisan dumbness 
yes 
winston-salem journal today publish 7.6 hospitalization forsyth county underlying condition publish age data 
weekly covid-19 surveillance report contain information page 6 wish report actual number instead hard read line chart though 
people selfish minor inconvenience fox news tell infringement liberty 
think people make informed decision usually reason people think research click around facebook find article know confirm previously hold belief mask dumb viable thousand scientist virologist actual research point wear goddamn mask moron 
reason people wear seat-belts fucking dumb like told also joe rogan say look like pussy wear mask 
politics 
non fox news take mask work underpaid coronavirus hit even labor constant sanitization wear mask make overheat feel light head even slight physical exertion fuck stayed close pay twice much stay home could stay close one thing capitalist society never tell landlord bank stop collect rent 
one may cause pretty sure infer common cause outcome 
thanks interest 24-75 group hospitalization 75 
asymptomatic positive percentage frighten 
unreal since joe rogan become expert infectious disease 
like look 3/4s population v le 10 percent course wider age gap go hospitalization small one especially consider u life expectancy 78 normally 
bill gate right 
try say look previous week 75 age category high number hospitalization time recent week 24-49 50-69 high number 75 change rank absolute number interest 
bill gate run foundation focus infectious disease think would know little average person 
3rd straight day 5th day week nc reach record coronavirus hospitalization 
yet somehow office reopen bar charlotte slam 
start think another stay home order fall/winter sooner 
uh yes go continue state stupid people think stupid thing desperate people trap poverty forced undertake dangerous work keep fed house ashamed north carolinian failure 
make sense read article people become infected young people also accord north carolina number almost half people coronavirus state 45 25 49 twenty percent 24 people age group make zero percent death good thing good thing could say nc figuring moment keep number limit nurse home elderly care center 7 people virus 75 70 state death age group past seven day average 16 people per day lose life total 1,225 north carolinian die far even case go hospitalization go seem case hit elderly people badly sah order put place may explain flat average death rate still concern though number go death rate flat instead go 
think happen cooper push mandatory mask usage though various protest political capital push shutdown mask though 
might show graph spanish 
somewhat reassure definitely ideal seem like measure put place making difference 
really curious age hospitalize though death rate age also start change young people infect especially virus hit rural area instead mostly urban rural area high obesity rate look risk factor also lead underlying health condition raise mortality rate two piece news make worry first age group people underlie health condition 6x likely hospitalize 12x likely die none second 1/4 hospitalize covid case texas right 20 young people infected high number necessarily prevent hospitalization large number 
young people start die two recent death cabarrus county 40 23 observer yesterday take time die see number go 
may probably end like first sah order cities/counties make sah order end in-person school half assed effort school big city like charlotte enacts sah order would pretty massive agree though point especially election year cooper wo political capital along ncga control gop wan'ts get thing go matter outcome 
saw 
there difference anti science trust shoddy science cant slap science word glorify astrologer make true 
prove point 
antibody study show people infected coronavirus nc number show 
much data release wfu public facing difficult make real assessment low number patient enrol study high false positive rate antibody test unfortunately take study far still enough information need keep wear mask doc say population truly 8 positive long way 80 need sort herd immunity 
especially new hanover county wife work medical field directly doctor oversee covid19 case bad lot bad official number imply confirmed case deaths alone unanimous agreement medical community go get much bad 
go like everywhere people even know 
hear arizona twice positives nc already 20 
get good evidence people get infect asymptomatic minimally symptomatic sander say people feel little bit scratchy throat little cough people study symptom vast majority people test antibody positive little symptoms sander say say 10 20 time number people identified case antibody infection say whoa boy quite chicken little sub realize sky fallin 
lmao citation need 
believe data article 1.05 million people n.c virus 10 positive antibody per wral article 
okay let go high estimate 20 time number people identified case antibody infection many people identified case approximately 2.2 million u believe statement mean approx 44 million infected treat gospel extrapolate number remain u population 284 million mean approx 750,000 die due covid-19 put perspective number 1 leading cause death u heart disease 647,457 cancer 599,108 leave unchecked covid-19 literally lead cause death american 2020 imagine could save three quarter million life simply wear mask wash hand keep socially distance month argue person refuse wear mask true chicken little scar judged peer scar look weak scared conforming scar caring 
common sense way virus spread 
quite news story quite mislead journalist often scientist wake forest study far 5,000 people test 0.4 percent identify public health official infect sander say unknown infectious asymptomatic people say people double social distancing effort quite important takeaway make suggestion governor need open closing make great plea everybody take lot care say need stay 6 foot apart need wear mask need stay away elder 10 whatever extrapolation make base test along area get people say data start roll blood donation center random sample set people might disease curious back april wfu put first result indicate 2 population test caution large cohort people risk high proportion nurse care giver would strongly caution anyone everyone listen u/pyretic87 say feel free read article science paper topic data still rush many many retraction end day dr sander correct need double social distancing effort wear mask protect especially elderly information change

lmao ok 
news story quite mislead journalist often scientist break embargo everything quote direct quote scientist journalist interpretation 
order extrapolate number would need data concern u population 50 necessary assume entire population infect would expect cfr remain approximately magic stats look large population see cfr x huge population stand reason x would hold true expands actually would argue get bad go maskless infection rate spike hospital saturate reason people reasonable chance survival right stack neck deep parking lot fight air 704 death come directly nurse home care facility point elderly disposable really justificaiton wear mask sorry grandma likely adverse effect covid-19 go even try prevent spread suck lol come downvotes well downvote quick cry literally refreshing page see karma anything sweet sweet karma guess 
put spin singular quote forget include actual advice doctor make suggestion governor need open closing make great plea everybody take lot care say need stay 6 foot apart need wear mask need stay away elder wonder would miss point yes bite sensationalized 17,000 people around piedmont test random sample sign test low sample size run false positive error antibody test already know right way would come internet call people chicken little would 
bold prediction million death body rot stairwell lead u panic first place 
point elderly disposable point high risk population likely fine instead absolutely destroy economy put million work great response instead would far prudent isolate protect risk individual 
time get herd immunity 1 mil dead minimum odds death pile fall hard time get lot folk go extends period herd immunity even longer 
well would prudent moron whitehouse do something november december instead wait march pas responsibility governor protect risk individual risk tight restriction care facility mandatory masks business strict social distance incentive business let employee wfh etc none thing devastate economy yet anyone support chicken little 
number data article state fund test imagine number release though medical data scrub identify data data may available elsewhere would imagine wral would link literally typed wake forest antibody study google get study enrollment 17,825 positive antibody test 8-10 
get orange man bad x200b well would prudent moron whitehouse do something november december instead wait march pas responsibility governor close border january time call racist xenophobic x200b protect risk individual risk tight restriction care facility mandatory masks business strict social distance incentive business let employee wfh etc king president power dictate state way allege far limit power president governor 
get orange man bad hurt feeling something clear president drop ball could do something november close border january wrong first action end january limit travel china nothing entire month february march trump say declared postal boy governor fight supply time call racist xenophobic oh person want lead country someone prepare let hundred thousand american die afraid criticism lol president power dictate state president ability lead coordinate effort national crisis instead abdicate responsiblity play political favorite governor people live line shitty person shitty president refuse support mandatory mask even though wo hurt economy busy lick orange popsicle least acknowledge point suspect intentionally damn good point 
imagine probably find answer question look 
ca wait 2024 npcs longer blame trump everything sure make excuse say linger action shit 
look like right lol 
nc report high coronavirus hospitalization 2nd-highest number new case 
neighbor nurse local hospital nc mention although good number covid hospitalization overwhelm majority discharge within 24-36 hour chalk people less scared go hospital nowhere wral article mention length average stay important assume hospitalization mean 2-3 week stay near death experience 
part state experience spike case 
plateaued little bit never actually make much progress far reduce technically evidence second wave wave along make thing bad rather well view whole welcome 2020 guess wait bit see happen far people die since indicator lag

metric would love see many discharge new admission 
good news side thing death continue trend downwards positive test flat slightly trend let ask far enough start blame protest 
last month test go around 8k month 16k case make sense see spike mean go terrible test rate slightly well see spike work past seven day north carolina curve case flat average 1,227 new case per day state pretty much flatten curve death novel coronavirus past seven day average 15 people per day lose life overall 1,262 people die north carolina pandemic 
nurse insist wear mask outside bad guess nurse stupid rest u 
nc er doctor check hospital area bed lock incredibly stressful try get people need go safely hospital 2-3 day mean big deal admit hospital think get admit go home die turn people around respiratory support good news every hospital admission big deal term overall importance resource utilization cost patient secondary complication one people even get discharge safely risk hospital acquire infection blood clot host problem come hospital admission 
decide next step latinos 10 population 44 case 7 death state wide death go much mostly young people like latino get case fact hispanics/latinos vastly over-represented covid case like almost 75 durham story media/government say much either 
city really spike sense whole lot people get still mostly case people become available test protest lot crowd allow spread also absolutely reap prison nurse home new either 
think ever leave first wave people claim drop past graph see simply show plateau significant decline 
first wave finally come rest country 
yeah spike steady climb 
great explanation may best thing read coronavirus data 
logical thinker right also hospitals north carolina mass email phone call request folk come see north carolina hospital struggle people ask get procedure hold people get tested people come hospital would correlate number increase completely dishonest report simple woeful ignorance medium side number always go increase people test always poor report data share medium wonder get respect anymore remember denominator massive freakout occur 300 million people u 11 million nc still react drastically less 1 people affected stop cherry pick data display 
ongoing 1st wave 
would like see many time people move goal post would also like see progression b theory float 
look like protest much term spread due outside high level mask wear plus increase nc started protest 
really look way per graph 
test impact hospitalization 
still mostly case people become available test 100 get information 
agree number overall case less helpful metric epidemiologist use overall number hospitalization well metric overall burden disease unfortunately number also continue rise steadily even practice rural nc 
right still first wave second wave first wave close non-existent 
first wave forever sigh 
yes exactly least live local wakemed show sign overwhelm live next doctor home day probably need 
goal post people move spike dont occur two week thousand attend race participate prostest 
also come much conversation open memorial day weekend week protest start remember see videos picture raleigh subreddit show people bar without mask social distancing 
even 100 protester wear mask stay 6ft apart still one teency weency little thing self-quarantine yeah guess everyone forget 
first link coincide reopen bar restaurant indoor establishment make hard trace uptick protest second link also state sah order end around start protest still show upswing tell maybe sah order need anymore news coverage saw show lot people protest wear mask really would extremely hard break 
well link dashboard page need dig deep death positive test 
comment though strictly point number case go outr test capability double 
time comment north carolina test increase increase test take get positive result big factor increase case 100 wrong 
say much fact latinos/hispanics young people vastly new covid case get thousand mostly wear mask white folk stand alamance county memorial day race three week ago hundred reopen month earlier neither covid outbreaks/clusters assoicated white people under-represented covid case june keep bringing race rise covid case tell one story demographic largely ignore tell another 
whataboutism never claim two week scientist 
fourth paragraph one minneapolis epicenter protest late may 1.4 percent test conduct protester last week come back positive well state overall positive test rate time average 3.7 percent week week 1,288 people test boston site set protester fourteen 1.08 percent come back positive location report measurable spike case widely attend protest include philadelphia seattle sacramento upstate new york idk news coverage watch almost coverage saw show mask plus friend go protest around triangle berkeley dc post picture essentially everyone masks plus slate article absence surge city massive demonstration large gathering take many official health analyst surprise however examine data video footage one thing clarify matter extent large percentage protester wear mask get people want blame upticks protest much except political gotcha point data essentially say gather outside mask pretty safe great news everyone especially people want open state another lock-down 
thought comment article hospitalization 
statement mostly case people become available test 100 wrong want say basis make claim 100 wrong right claim still absolutely wrong mostly case people get coronavirus 
mostly watch local raleigh news wral channel 11 really care uptick come protester people go back work go bar whatever go happen everything firing hat see hypocrisy say kill people reopen thing protest okay think need get back thing safely course importantly protect risk group good many reason keep everything shut almost seem like select group almost celebrate new record hospitalization race come post stay silent day drop btw per recent post regard antibody test good news would bring death rate 0.2 0.1 close cdc estimation lower month ago line common respiratory virus mean number correct get covid chance survival chance survival get flu however seem much contagious many people face odds virus dangerous immunocompromised far high death rate contract virus 
headline state 2nd high new case 
ala feel nitpicking fine 
ffs quote dude internet good news would bring death rate 0.2 0.1 close cdc estimation lower month ago line common respiratory virus mean number correct get covid chance survival chance survival get flu however seem much contagious many people face odds virus dangerous immunocompromised far high death rate contract virus interpretation data wake forest data current ifr around flu 0.1 regardless flu infect 8 u population per year covid due novel infect 80 population please love goodness read source figure someone actually post say blindly quote exactly misinformation spread 
thank comment 
headline also state high hospitalization 
would say sorry attribute north carolina rise coronavirus case mostly rise test ignorant close family living incredibly concerned well-being people live far tell simply care virus large part keep hear sort thing say whole state go feel one 
quote article month half old one couple week ago reference cdc directly claim center disease control prevention confirm 0.2 death rate covid-19 range estimate put fatality rate show symptom 0.2 1 best estimate 0.4 also place number asymptomatic case 20 50 best estimate 35 combine two estimate estimate overall fatality rate infect virus without symptom would 0.26 
ಠ_ಠ 
understand 
even number remotely right scale incredibly different flu 0.1 covid 0.26 flu infects 8 million per year covid could infect 80 u population flu season 2018-2019 kill 34,200 people covid kill 120,000 people less time somehow tell u even remotely equal 121,000 dead lock-downs across u 20 unemployment halt economy kindly bugger flu comparison never even similar never 
say equal note death rate slightly high considerably higher yes people catch important know much less deadly many think especially outside risk group useful decide open thing keep mind many death nurse home still issue much less impacted reopen thing since learn lock also many thing change thing number death nationwide steadily drop learn manage say quite time know thing discover would issue fact suspect flu season go forward go much less lesson learn second wave hit believe much good place manage wo like first wave 
honest question know single latin american us latinx date south american spanish teacher friend dozen spanish teacher various country latin america literally none ever hear latinx ask woman way proudly refer latina believe watch video group liberal conservative latin american agree nothing except fact think latinx stupid

proactive refreshing see 
north carolina total corona virus case day 
death covid tragic look congregate v non-congregate large disparity today ncdhhs 1,104 death deaths 319 non-congregate 42,675 case 20,760 non-congregate reason bring congregate population prisons/nursing homes/assisted live population rarely ever go public 
phase 3 come 
best way show data ca see rate difference growth time since test ramp likely still see infection time due disease still community know people really go unless work grocery exercise wear fask mask stay 6ft apart wash hand nah let go race track church unfortunately protest 
sometimes simple chart powerful show silliness 
test case 
bound happen people selfish think others friend refuse wear mask ca breathe like corona would make even hard breathe even protest like one 5 wear one stick refuse would take joint effort everyone mild inconvenience apparently end world 
would also like see plot various projection nc past month well worse expect 
serious question wo slope two point demonstrate rate change i.e steeper slope faster growth time 
well yeah think clear literally every important metric go part say 
yes also wear mask keep social distance think virus go nothing go happen case 
death rate steady decline since may 25th 
actually complicate wish get information medical personnel rather politician medical personnel work beholden politician personal opinion spread number case population density wear mask least 6 foot get place instituted mandatory mask rule case continue climb hand get place like area mask usage drop much 12 8 remain low case distance factor get thousand people pile urban area go spread mention need start try figure address collateral damage measure take depression suicide drug alcohol abuse health problem exacerbate delayed/ignored/denied treatment domestic violence crime 
thing single data point paint picture would explain think assume know care know matter 
false 
waaay reasonable comment conversation mean much easy cut dry vote leave mind shut economy properly test successful vaccine vote right non-issue glad able clear 
post positive stat one data point still positive stat amongst sea negative 
accord graph correct 
outside context thread totally completely agree inside context thread much 
fair
