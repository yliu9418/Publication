covid-19 hospitalization update june 1 
three day ago hospitalization trend reopen bad idea today second day row move average hospitalization trend know medium go report mean much mean much bad news three day ago.stay positive 
wait go even high week two 
thanks post nc whole correct 
uhh math suppose 7 day roll average line work 7 high single-day hospitalization number last week average 7 high somehow come average go math work like holy shit nc cook number covid-19 dashboard like fl 
might well point lockdown keep u hospital capacity far good 
correct 
yeah trend line mislabelled 7 day roll average download file download label move average hospitalization previous 3 next 3 along table across recent day next 3 yet average many day last data point average last 4 day one 5 6 never 7 day average meaningless compare last two point average anything 
might want rethink nothing wrong chart understand 7 day roll average mean 
dude embarrass calculator need help show 650 case today 8 day ago show 627 tell replace 627 650 average average go wral get right page scroll nc coronavirus death hospitalization click 7 day average hospitalization today high average date 
definitely either mislabeled wrong date look rolling average dot 5/19 high max previous seven day best guess roll average line actually offset number day accident time math hard 
nothing wrong chart order emphasize recent data average weight late one influence yes math hard assume analysis wrong understand 
ca calc without weight know several example past average drop go 8th day look close miss point though hospitalization last three day lower previous three really want wrong want people sick stick wral data update something less positive prefer optimist 
guess b trend line stats package basis model real stats like wh advisor use excel cubic trendline fatality number cynically may try different kind trend line find one look like want 
7 day unweighted average use remove substantial day-of-week variation data weight recent day heavily would new kind brain dead nobody 
actually think weighted average line change weight number roll tomorrow 600 weight differently today guess screen capture today would catch line change tomorrow care check still fix place day lead line deviation upwards opposite three plot spot two forest tree last three day show reason optimism 
understand chart use 7 day average remove day-of-week variation trend weight day differently would make zero sense math perfect 
call exponential weighted average extremely common especially finance try identify trend make sense weight recent data would explain line go even though daily number high 
yes weight average assume note chart anomaly like pointed simple 7-day move average maybe correct someone poor spreadsheet skill maybe smarter want admit 
familiar ewma would make sense download file figure see reply post 
right bring fire make clear fire go warranted backing hospital take discharge different number people depend day week day-of-week variation make sense compare say monday tuesday make sense compare monday previous monday usually do entire week entire week fundamental reason trend line like always simple 7 day roll average always except apparently nc dashboard find disturb right direct uncalled know use weighted average make sense 
early ordeal learn analyze number rather trust anyone else sound like together also post r/bullcity see increased case trumpet meant increase rate spread change lockdown test also increase valid evidence want counter hop different conservative le panicked message hospitalization well indicator spiral control honestly interested message/hope/data spread continue control manageable rate understand point weight good illustration trend look day still conclude control spread state intent phase hospitalization spike still conclusion 
covid-19 case count update may 31 180 
11:15 a.m north carolina double number coronavirus test administer may compare month april 128,517 test give may 287,772 test percentage positive test remain steady 6.9 
oh yeah deadly pandemic forgot 
context state level test past two week positive test rate nc overall 7.0 prior two week state wide positive rate 6.4 real way tell durham compare base rate could worse use state-wide level proxy 
thanks share certainly hope long term trend assert come week 
would suggest start update start one hospitalization sensationalized bad news dishonest 
durham co covid-19 case count update jun 1 163 
still lack denominator number test perform 
yesterday report durham co include 58 new case 1 death additional context prior 2-week period state-level positive rate 6.4 past two week 7.2 take wider view past 2 month state-wide positive rate 7.1 
think see spike cases/hospitalizations/deaths relate current ongoing protest pretty much outside see spike relate reopen protest although small number hardly reopen folk wear mask relative floyd protester think gon na see outside safe general business/group activity move outside might mean close street pedestrian zone seat outside also change open hour various business people deal midday heat 
number patient hospitalize covid-19 jump 66 716 information come 89 hospital report data tuesday compare 75 monday state official say 77 ventilator available 27 hospital bed 20 intensive care bed available sign state healthcare system room accommodate new covid-19 patient spike case occur unless look wrong look like increase hospitalization due hospital report number 
yes sense ever go get one county whole explanation get make sense report system cross county line durham co total test number database anywhere take duke example let say duke report single number test state test perform many different location duke everywhere state idea many durham co course would mean someone follow positive case determine person life intractable problem one could avoid require detailed data share negative test maybe provider refuse could provide level detail know give fact limit public health resource hard fault put super robust data collection process early wish would really help contextualize local trade-off relax restriction increase case understand able 
fear would go 
simply matter grow number test percent test return positive result also grow least orange county think also true durham county wife work orange co health dept 
6.4 7.2 may within margin error word without data trend line may impossible tell actually increase noise 
finger cross 
see spike relate reopen protest oppose protest sub need eat bit crow one adamant go cause death protest drop completely cause care start protest 
fair enough suppose but—as wrote—it really make difficult put number context even number test perform durham county would helpful although relatively relative place low rate incidence small misreport number test could bad ramification thanks always 
percent test return positive result also grow least orange county think also true durham county people want number people test determine positive changing 
use term margin error people probably familiar concept public polling randomly sample portion population poll obviously case since people test random sample population heard much use moe context epidemiology care add detail observation 
imagine thought day people forbid hold funeral love one 
sub need eat bit crow one r/raleigh go nut house selfish piece shit yeah floyd protest noble cause term risk much different post 
oh sure broadly speak lot people talk like health department look data get report little 1 page flyer want chime look professional epidemiologist staff dig in-depth material publish info see page 9 pdf update weekly 
assay false positive false negative rate intrinsic assay technology also vary depend sample take store shipped prepared top guideline receives test undergone multiple change past three month guideline always follow carefully labs provider addition lab report data way regular basis may spike positive represent report schedule transmission finally locales may occasion perform focused test high risk area high transmission rate e.g nurse home result sporadic spike positive actually represent ongoing community transmission rate whole reason generally look positive comparison two date trend line consistent slope much indicative go wild 
let check coworker take aunt mother funeral ohio three get hospital stay 7 10 15-days sound unpleasant 
group still think right decision 
good point especially variation report schedule thanks 
much funeral take place indoors probably imagine 
ok support past weekend mass gathering right 
surely support weekend mass gathering 
burial reception outdoors funeral indoors 
think seem keep misunderstand support understand attend good idea personal health good idea public health thing everyone agree exact set support past week mass gather protest murder george floyd understand protest attend choose donate nc naacp instead unsure good idea personal health think good think collective health doctor six month old pandemic brand new medical term 400 year old american issue bloody complicate keep ask black white gotchas 
family choose gather memorial time mean feel certain issue important others young man brutally murder police symbolize many underlying systemic issue lot important gathering celebrate life wonderful old gentleman long battle choose stay safe throughout entire pandemic choice family choice close go downtown tonight still would hold memorial go reopen nc protest much irritation sub downvotes galore whatever refuse take hard stance though explain many unemployeed hurt right heard agree issue mean call name 
thanks reply criticism fair simply frustrate many people urge sometimes angrily others follow certain rule great cost willfully ignore one primary rule suggest one two thing either people think protest righteous order happen many innocent must die think likely really believe costly rule impose others first place 
sound like lot mental gymnastics 
balance safety priority alone 
course balance safety priority like people able bury dead mother 
mean already dead like go anywhere bury 
nc covid-19 hospitalization update june 2 
look chart say 716 people hospital covid-19 6/2 650 people hospital covid-19 6/1 look change 5/31 6/1 
check bit possible bar barely high remember

73 new case report yesterday durham also saw trend line nose mean rate increase previous two week period last two week go quite bit 2 week ago 65 new case 4 week ago 10 current pattern hold least new case plateaued opposed continued acceleration re-opening plateau case count good news let see hold come day week 
look 7 day roll average instead day-to-day beyond increased testing confirm case go best look roll average hospitalization death get good picture happen 
seem like still early make meaningful conclusion either way reason hopeful least noticed state positive test rate look like may plateaued probably early effect people travel much holiday show data

durham co covid-19 case count update jun 4 137 
bad news 100 new case first time yesterday acceleration new case still 100 measured recent two week period v prior two week period good news nc entire state report high single-day test count 19k positive rate prior week still 7.2 range also good news state-wide level people leave hospital admit 2nd day row topic increase case related increase test thought first likely durham co increase new case related increase test without know durham test increase accordingly assume durham test people well daily record set yesterday case may alarm sound flip side case continue accelerate 3 hard data point durham co new case hospitalization deaths hospitalization death lag new case several day week increase test state level good sign know test look like durham co know whether acceleration case due increased transmission increase test wo know effect new case hospitalizations/deaths week focus case close early-warning system issue durham co everyone interpret data act accordingly want rationalize daily case count record base state-level testing record one thing use hospitalization data death data brush case count record dubious wo know whether today case turn deaths several week 
map estimate r0 one modeler cover pandemic share map show estimate reproduction rate virus state nc among state high transmission rate 
hey figure percentage find website 
whats positive percentage v amount test 
hospitalization death keep hearing case corona virus hear part story think positive case people test mean people go hospital death occur ever seem include news story seem agenda scare scare people without fact 
also mean great possibility old folk infect could serious transmission high guess get survive faster thing could squash right 
hospital number encouraging sure thanks 
little bad news state data really hard interpret meaningfully nc data report directly state distribute individual county fully understand nc system specific weird way handle people test multiple time effect mean actually know number test perform aligns number positive test number people know many people get multiple test ca say much change data though orange co health dept realize day two ago know county know 
record daily total calculation right website anywhere 
know total number test do durham co get number positive test see previous post total test count available county level 
yes hospitalization nc trend high number state record 717 set today 
one viewpoint aware 2nd grader durham die covid-19 many folk may open perspective right ever 
heard immunity likely require 60-80 population antibody support infection many human 
evidence around country case become less anyone guess 
ok cool delete june 5th calculation 
think read see number provide scary however let say 5 positive test scary 
hospitalization nc trend number patient hospitalize covid-19 jump 66 716 information come 89 hospital report data tuesday compare 75 monday dr mandy cohen dhhs secretary say encouraging metric percentage people visit emergency room covid-19 symptom percentage decline though state official acknowledge overall traffic emergency room increase perhaps people fear seek treatment non-covid illness subsides two metric number new case percentage people test positive paint mixed picture nearly 9,300 people test positive since memorial day increase 39 percentage test positive remains steady suggest much increase due extensive testing cohen note north carolina hospital still plenty capacity treat coronavirus patient even resumption non-urgent procedure friday 3,700 hospital bed 521 intensive care unit bed available state accord dhhs hospital report number look like people go hospital go due feeling safe go instead stay home 
oh dont disagree compare flu however flu dangerous every winter thousand die young old damn tragic 
herd immunity lot complex 60-80 estimate assume static r0 research virus far heterogeneous spread could reach level herd immunity far far low figure due clustering behavior 
viral activity typically fall summer month anyway doctor biologist virologist anything related resembling thing 
actually normal case become less severe evolution virus bacteria pretty much whatever want kill food die die evolutionary speaking longer stay alive long virus also stay alive mean less severe strain virus spread severe strain virus actually die remember h1n1 huge deal strike pretty deadly compare normal influenza strain however several generation virus serious strain burn h1n1 another flu deadly average strain thing happen spanish flu quarantine vaccine stop spanish flu evolution ca find vaccine covid-19 thing happen covid-19 eventually become another coronavirus people get time coronavirus 2nd common culprit common cold behind rhinovirus 
realize post jun 5 jun 6 time assume total day jun 5 pct change inflate result 
mixed picture great way describe stats good sign bad sign certainly slam dunk story either way right 
keep mind yearly flu vaccine assist immunity vaccine yet covid herd immunity discussion might realistic point 
yes three primary reason 1 humidity great environment disease variety reason cause clump together instead spread like cloud environment make nose quite runny mean people infect spread easy virus bacteria tend replicate well moisture 2 uv light come atmosphere instead reflect away virus bacteria die quickly uv light 3 people tend outside mean also away human being virus bacteria spread much recirculated air system 
understanding coronaviruses work well also share lack qualification could weather could mutation could face mask reduce viral load could mild case always great test finally get case anyone guess 
yealy say observation apply western central pennsylvania along community new york maryland serve upmc would surprised observation find elsewhere italian doctor cause big stir report something similar although much dramatic term swab perform last 10 day show viral load quantitative term absolutely infinitesimal compare one carry patient month two ago tell rai television sunday cite study massimo clementi director microbiology virology laboratory san raffaele hospital reportedly due publish shortly 
yup wonder mutate something le virulent speculate original comment see actual evidence suggest especially give see change season potentially impact mask great vitamin level lot confound variable totally agree long skeptical idea look deadly subsequent wave virus might get wave see anything suggest deadlier happen 1918 different whole host reason fit nature virus explain 
gotcha thank 
sars part yearly flu vaccine right vaccine ready covid19 safe assume part flu vaccine

durham co covid-19 case count update jun 5 168 
2nd consecutive day 101 new case statewide positive rate 9.3 high single day case count nc whole great report 
hospitalization also peak statewide 717 
durham co covid-19 case count update jun 6 138 
yesterday report durham co include 48 new case 0 death steady 130 150 range past week term acceleration case durham co achieve plateau new case number would need 0 additional context prior 2-week period state-level positive rate 6.4 past two week 7.4 take wider view past 2 month state-wide positive rate 7.1 state record 3 day 9 positive test far june may 5 day total hard escape feel transmission increase argument increase test hard reconcile increase positive test rate 
feel like unexpected ultimate goal flatten curve 
curve want flatten anything 100 chart mean active case double every two week less truly flatten curve graph would drop towards 0 mean active case count would stay 
durham curve accelerate upward flatten curve nc meaningful degree flatten curve generally come reduced positive test rate state-wide test rate increase per ncdhhs 
sound like move goalpost dr mandy cohen dhhs secretary say encouraging metric percentage people visit emergency room covid-19 symptom percentage decline though state official acknowledge overall traffic emergency room increase perhaps people fear seek treatment non-covid illness subsides cohen note north carolina hospital still plenty capacity treat coronavirus patient even resumption non-urgent procedure friday 3,700 hospital bed 521 intensive care unit bed available state accord dhhs point lockdown give hospital breathe room goal never stomp covid case bring near zero 11 a.m christian lawson clinical director emergency service unc health say hospital ready take coronavius patient north carolina number case continue grow lawson say ppe readily available china resume production 
honestly surprise positive rate increase test become available get test think might sample bias test limited thought quarantine stay touch md via tele-health md prescribe test admit dug detail much many others alarm much 
understand goal regard flatten curve think originally give hospital time breathe room operate take surge apparently capacity time 
understand difference case equal zero case growth rate equal zero ca help one advocate goal zero case claim intentionally mislead 
exactly go respond thank 
sound like suck enough dick 
agree right case continue accelerate rate jeopardy think misconception nc initial spike case peak plateaued small initial outbreak accelerating week plateaued flattened curve meaningful way especially durham co currently hospital capacity guarantee go forward 
100 agree could get 0 chart would mean many new case prior period get 0 chart would mean flattened curve nowhere near right 
year learn american basic numeracy skill 
difference case equal zero case growth rate equal zero term message regard flatten curve distinction without difference tell early need stay home protect hospital worker others front line would space ability treat people come well capacity one local hospital indicate otherwise remember stay home seem like y'all forgot 
think misconception nc initial spike case peak plateaued small initial outbreak accelerating week plateaued flattened curve meaningful way especially durham co think true much country outside major metro area brace devastate community-wide spike never come instead middle incline wide hill know high hill phase reopenings memorial day gathering travel protest increase transmission unlike people well educate risk factor virus hop people continue safe keep get bad could 
think misconception nc initial spike case peak plateaued small initial outbreak accelerate week think test capacity initially suck long time nc look like hit hard ramp test look lot bad increase test effort 
well nothing guarantee across nation run hospitals new york hardest hit hospital ship 19ish patient field hospital never saw one patient difficult time decision sure however need realistic real impact society 
many lack critical thinking 
hello physician durham answer question tell stay home reduce rate virus spread example 20 people covid-19 come ed every day handle number increase 40 turn regular bed icu bed 80 people come daily people die street outside full hospital need keep number new case constant example 20 per day mean percentage increase 0 graph show percent increase 100 keep 20 patient daily go 40 80 percent increase distinction difference hope understand ask simply accept understand concept 
right think need go back sort full lockdown important recognize gotten outbreak risk transmission high ever risk manageable assume let guard 
would agree except positive test rate increase instead decrease rise case due increase test would expect positive rate would decrease least flat recognize rate data statewide reason think durham special far spread 
suggest nyc-style outbreak durham would acceptable say disagree 
hospital ship utilized federal administration would accept patient unless meet specific criterion limitation make hospital ship useless real hospital make regular bed icu bed place icu bed lobby absolutely run hospital nc physician speaks nyc doctor deal 
sorry feel kind contradict slightly ifwe still steadily grow still high risk would signal lock back degree least loudly put back table make sure everybody know 
rate data statewide correct orange county also see increase positive without increase test ca calculate positive county think par state newly achieve 10 rate today 
hospital ship negative pressure room plan treat non-covid-19 patient 
fair point frankly know enough epidemiology public health feel confident make call data guy possible everyone continue abide social distancing rule wear mask public wo get unacceptable situation possible even current trend never overwhelm hospital many factor play everyone personal spectrum approach daily live age covid government job make pronouncement apply everyone personally data suggests outbreak intensify cautious data suggest caution public health official expert whether mean renew restriction simply stay course think everyone need acknowledge little know disease trajectory thing go play 
plan begin treat covid-19 patient time comfort departure approximately 1,200-person crew 1,000-bed hospital treat 182 patient approximately 70 percent covid-19 accord capt patrick amersbach command officer comfort medical treatment facility however never treat many due bureaucratic red tape 
durham co covid-19 case count update jun 7 143 
2020 go multiple chapter history book sure plenty people think open fast ca say anything l want call people stop protest blm mean even protest make comfortable public 
yesterday report durham co include 104 new case 0 death additional context prior 2-week period state-level positive rate 6.5 past two week 7.2 take wider view past 2 month state-wide positive rate 7.1 yesterday well day state-wide level positive rate 6.6 yesterday reiterate graphic show horizontal line 100 growth represent plateau get 0 growth would mean exact number new case occur recent prior 2 week period 0 graphic would represent plateau keep current rate growth 143.5 jun 22 would expect see 2,264 new case since today jun 8 
read somewhere 70 new case durham among hispanic community massively disproportionate percent county hispanic really represent disparity type job etc know true 
think something important note partial result increase test good know half battle also follow several month notice national scale general less positive case weekends/early week due reduce testing resource read test would expect 2200 today likely around wednesday stay safe 
good news announce asymptomatic spread actually data still seem rare asymptomatic person actually transmit onward secondary individual dr maria van kerkhove head emerge disease zoonosis unit say news briefing united nation agency geneva headquarters rare number report country detail contact trace say follow asymptomatic case follow contact find secondary transmission onward rare 
base data whats percentage typical healthy young middle age range person get covid like 60 10 one get whats percentage serious 
lab case double 3 week approximately accord nc dashboard 
best place get test durham 
comfortable public chance get covid outdoors always much less get cramped indoor space outbreaks primarily occur public policy opinion keep science outdoor transmission regard see tidbit matt gross state n.c department health human service study show odds disease transmission indoors approximately 18.7 time higher open air environment gross tell lawmaker risk outdoors always overblown imo go various protest large gathering outdoors 
number death go nationally see nc 
look lab positive case compare look hospitalization useful also 30 think 3 week likely never see 0 growth stop track opinion obviously country complete lockdown chance fail deal start open 
really dig total case count information county publish ca really say much breakdown race/gender/age anyone link 
2,200 estimate entire 2 week period trend purpose ever look roll 2 week period exact reason state 
totally missed mean comment 2,200 number estimate number new case would expect see today jun 22 rate increase stay new case cumulative case say would see many case next 2 week see date since mar 9 
people tabulate data probably work weekend type graph 
make direct conflict state health secretary mandy cohen say monday new analysis many study show many 49 case novel coronavirus spread people show symptom well idea shit 
say spread virus still increase high rate north carolina bunch symptomatic people keep go public cough around others find hard believe 
since retract statement disappoint 
data age percentage young people get hospitalize sorry wish one thing say number case increase great chance one person contract disease 
nyc good job track case death rate age underlying condition case rate death rate death age underlying condition north carolina risk factor covid-19 
large number case may construction worker wonder indoor challenge question durham weekly data possibly relevant completely conjecture worker latino unemployed latino could point spread environment job site opposite spread social environment 
fauci agree sentiment study account condition similar protest 
speak durham never many death locally flat term death almost add commentary earlier far deaths bright spot sort start see case count accelerate 3 week ago probably soon say continue since death lag detection case long possible new case young people le risk serious result covid assumption wo know sure week 
death data noisy low case count last data show change spike case obvious reason clear spike covid hospitalization nc last 4 week set yet another state record hospitalize covid patient today 
get rough look demographic section click view chart button check right show monthly percentage easily see spike case among hispanic community 
also data hispanic latinx individual over-represented covid-19 case 67 case may among hispanic latinx individual 14 durham county resident identify hispanic latinx may greatest number case occur among people work construction unemployed people people live work nursing care facility 
make total sense great breakdown always appreciate 
wonder percentage positive time period like number increasing/flat/decreasing even flat could see problem mean likely wayyyyyy case ca test fast enough y'know 
yeah dunno overall terrible messaging also base announcement report country much good contact trace presumably place like south korea singapore inclined place weight plus link nc research ca adequately judge either really 
people interpret asymptomatic spread mean spread people exhibit symptom asymptomatic case one infect person never develop symptom anywhere 25-40 case know people contagious 2 day develop symptom consider pre-symptomatic spread sure make distinction 
make nervous day make 3 month without catch seem like matter time 
thanks check 
suspect indoor construction involve safety health large construction association company primarily work inside complete structure confine space electrician heat air drywall finish etc significant problem covid-19 company outdoor work highway civil utility etc issue office administrative personnel really viral load require infection gain foothold system air movement dispersal virus particle air public simultaneously overestimate danger outdoor contact underestimating danger indoor exposure 
dr mandy cohen dhhs secretary say encouraging metric percentage people visit emergency room covid-19 symptom percentage decline though state official acknowledge overall traffic emergency room increase perhaps people fear seek treatment non-covid illness subsides know get whole story hospitalization though see spike death commensurate rise hospitalization know people go hospital apparently feel safer 
state level positive rate go ncdhhs say today positive rate one high country 
public simultaneously overestimate danger outdoor contact underestimating danger indoor exposure post elsewhere thread may also overestimate danger asymptomatic spread report sound like breed ground closely confine indoor space symptom might hard notice make perfect sense give prevalent nursing home meatpacking facility 
yayyy 1 oh wait shit 
durham co covid-19 case count update jun 8 118

nc case count trend last week look like less case wednesday last wednesday reading right 
possibly protest primary source transmission lot people protest go got test could cause decrease positive rate sure course want see day decrease positive rate drawing conclusion

care point let run course stay inside summer 
come say time high inpatient covid case one local hospital 
wear mask public avoid large gathering simple thing keep fungus spot transmission virus small agree tough watch inexorable march upward number one suggest go back stay-at-home trend continue would surprised end 
nc 6.9 positive today compare 7.7 may 11 unless read wrong do quite bit 
honest question mean inflammatory anything want understand prepare die virus like outcome okay 
argue new reddit account folk 
ballpark many covid case ballpark hospital covid capacity represent try get handle current case correspond current strain hospital theory ratio case strain consistent would help put current trend perspective 
trend continue always expect though reopenings lockdown give hospital time prepare surge local area hosptials say prepared thought idea slow delay rise infection stop increase altogether 
dude always number sure see make mistake 
particular date month apart 
think real calculation many people make everyone everyone situation 2-.8 die nah probably prepare inconvenience another year sake victim nah probably say conscientious reopen certain thing idea care literally bad point locally far bananas level selfish also completely disingenuous question actually outside appropriately distance one safe thing whole thing edit stats 
dude inflammatory troll frame question unnecessarily fear-mongery prepared die virus ask question get car go road trip people kind risk profile get covid carry 50 symptomatic 99.95 chance survive 99.8 50 64 people disagree ask willing shut life next however many month suffer unemployment depression avoid 0.05 risk die answer would emphatic literally four time low probability die next year give age 
worry get kill someone texting drive covid one make world alive heck good life insurance policy wife happy 
new year idiot moderator boot cause unpopular opinion guess freedom speech exist internet meanwhile get people curse storm incite violence sub naked men woman zucchini ass 
receive email daily number inpatient people due covid icu number share high ever say yet reach 50 capacity assume strain much yet say new icu case daily see week two trend 
may prepare point rate increase continue unabated overwhelm slow delay rise infection see increase rate new case percentage line graph would 0 100 
yea goal think sort restrictive measure put place unless see occupancy get close threshold throughout region hospital prepare within reason growth rate start look dangerous standpoint know one situation death rate spike though resource require competent care ca keep demand later model see awhile since check actually push predicted regional peak around let hope 
6.8 june 4th however wral give various disclaimer percent positive methodology nc also vastly increase test month ago either go stay flat percent positive test mixed bag look like 
1-3 die order magnitude 
valid 22 healthy scar die virus scar one people experience long-lasting permanent course virus actually factor risk long road trip make usually prefer fly bad accident child like risk car ride present factor long term health consequence diet eat thing always get 8 hour sleep exercise daily smoke drug really drink value long healthy life know thing mark impact think short-term reward resume life normal robust contact trace test believe really well place worth risk suffer permanent damage body probably would better frame like instead die agree apologize come across fear-mongery think way could open specifically outdoor activity look safest right intelligently work solid contact trace system prevent new infection certainly open inside restaurant gyms bar situation stand opinion 
first mistake never worth dead alive 
thanks even know hover around 50 helpful contextualize number know one one relationship know 1,066 case 14 day county-level connect one hospital 50 capacity helpful context 
rate increase continue unabated overwhelm march 2nd north carolina large facility may enough bed deal surge patient say david weber infectious disease physician lead infectious disease response unc state hospital run virtually 100 percent occupancy give day say patient sit ed wait come wait patient discharge people would like transfer patient u small hospital need level care large academic center provide tell wait period time empty bed june 5th cohen note north carolina hospital still plenty capacity treat coronavirus patient even resumption non-urgent procedure friday 3,700 hospital bed 521 intensive care unit bed available state accord dhhs june 9th point time 84 percent hospital report expert say still good shape see spike really far away see hospital get capacity level term bed icu bed ventilator duke say assert hospital overwhelm message medium hospital indicate ready contrast lockdown three month ago guess see happens 
take average past two week positive rate go 6.4 7.2 sec cohen even reference high gotten day ago nc positive rate definitely go flat positive rate increase 
sorry think get clearly imply bad 
pretty reasonable take respect get really frustrated hear perfectly healthy people risk life go back work wo give second thought drive 3 hour asheville drink every night eat shit diet seem like get say would encourage look close percentage people actually suffer long-lasting damage virus cdc currently estimate less 2 people 50 hospitalize give much fatality rate scale linearly age hospitalization rate likely follow similar trend much low someone age health also even low factor asymptomatic patient include number base talk probably 1 chance hospitalize guarantee long-term complication either calculus least ultimately time get pneumonia risk long-term lung damage whether covid flu 
today spike even seem trend rapidly 
would effectively manage nursing home already would worry hospital capacity hospitalization rate 65 old four time higher 50 population 
know point term case would hit capacity term icu bed number know choose err side caution number high enough case could go 5x month track would still capacity good month give 25 bed free across state per article doubt go month 138 rate increase hit limit ca look thing look like today choose behavior need look thing 2 4 6 week 
right get cdc current best estimate fatality rate 0.4 
would effectively manage nursing home already yeah lot room improvement test nurse home public private do soon ability 
confident data remain constant keep hearing epidemiologist physicians claim best tell still current rapidly change data still seem fluctuate 1-3 depend various factor ai troll btw one thing love wrong 
seriously believe take mid-june finally nearly 1 10 long-term care resident nj die covid know part response march like florida 
believe share data much possible sorry come across inflammatory initial estimate back march 1-3 seroprevalence study number keep come unfortunately rarely get report handful study back 0.2-0.8 range take account historical experience trend data increase number infection population large potential impact misclassification death give presumed estimate covid-19 ifr somewhere 0.1 0.41 infection fatality rate range 0.02 0.86 median 0.26 corrected value range 0.02 0.78 median 0.25 among people 70 year old infection fatality rate range 0.00 0.26 median 0.05 correct 0.00-0.23 median 0.04 also spreadsheet seroprevalence study infer ifrs although reviewed 
confident data remain constant iirc ifr go past certain period time sars virus 
interesting thanks 
would line doctor far severity lower viral load lesser symptom well outcomes lot potential factor play speculation virus mutate become le fatal virus tend

durham co positive rate rather important metric leave 
see anything outbreak tie recent floyd protest rest nc two week 
number test do durham co publish anywhere calculate specific positive rate county would important metric agree unfortunately available 
honestly idea drive number know test level state whole frankly think fool errand try account specific event unless sort data attend positive test rate even tricky make sort causal link short idea 
know answer fwiw son come visit tonight wore mask entire time protest since last see tell pretty much 99 protester saw ch durham wear mask social distance good know 
think fair say give know chance outdoor spread virus low see spike directly attributable large outdoor protest time start adjust policy open park playgrounds seat outside maybe close street pedestrian zone like rigsbee front fullsteam instance 
think probably right practical caveat consensus seem risk spread lower outdoors people outdoor space wear mask observe social distance doubt overall trajectory would greatly affected gain psychological perspective would almost certainly outweigh extra risk course optic great opening positive rate keep tick new case count keep accelerate upwards could see reticence part authority actually go see might want send overly optimistic signal open thing like suggest glad make decision 
durham co covid-19 case count update jun 15 82

new weekly data report data report little stale since go june 8 stuff live chart data hub look like trend continue hispanic latinx individual over-represented covid-19 case 73 case far june among hispanic latinx individual 14 durham county resident identify hispanic latinx june far great number case know employment information occur among people work construction people live work nursing care facility people unemployed regard positive test rate report say track two surveillance effort surveillance effort 1 first effort reflect prevalence positive test insured population within durham county positive test prevalence population 15 increase 13 last week surveillance effort 2 second effort community-based positive test prevalence population 17 last week 
death number go volume positive case honest question 
thanks update people tune though since day every day 
estimate percent positive test 15-17 really suck durham get together go anywhere unless wear mask go anywhere 
anyone wonder effect protest might thing go minnesota case count hospitalization go three week since protest grant different state whatever happen nc due various protest 
tie today time hospitalization high state keep eating 
estimate percent positive test result really alarm go back work week retail excite 
state level new daily case consistently increase since march daily death hit 15 25 mid-april really move much anything daily death might go last week data still preliminary 
do real analysis around death durham 2 thing consider first death go lag new case period week month wo know death spike current rise new case long time second number death also function hospital utilization get point hospital get stretch far number icu bed death rate could go key far concerned keep hospital utilization rate go much say death certainly tragic limited utility help u understand whether dial caution 
yeah real risk forget wish something like 82 figure really trumpet durham health department could collectively celebrate go 
keep eat hispanic latinx individual over-represented covid-19 case 73 case far june among hispanic latinx individual 14 durham county resident identify hispanic something go folk go eat like state enough protect people nurse home prison meat pack plant enough protect people overrepresented covid case 
look last week though across state hospitalization almost flat new high yes people exponential growth mild uptick call win give deal 
say another way go eat try avoid sit inside wear mask server table much well wear one yes outbreak still accelerate durham co precaution people take good 
pretty sure model predict peak hospitalization early july heard cmo month ago expect model account reduce social distancing 
hispanic latinx individual over-represented covid-19 case 73 case far june among hispanic latinx individual 14 durham county resident identify hispanic latinx go back work week retail hispanic folk durham vastly disproportionately make either retail workforce retail customer last time check construction site different story though really need focus area hispanic population make bulk new covid case affect 
nothing wrong find bright spot say hospitalization go lag case several day minimum risk go run case continue accelerate hospitalization likely go follow percent number case hard-cap icu bed start get filled real problem yes hospitalization increase much hospitalization follow new case still accelerate would want people declare victory hospitalization increase slowly mean let guard prematurely

durham co covid-19 case count update jun 16 73 
worry sparkline interpreted people take time understand discrete differential value slide window layperson could easily misinterpret glance believe case go one sparkline trend downward secondly line 100 reason unclear trend line currently 
yesterday report durham co include 83 new case 1 death past 2 week average 81 new case per day additional context prior 2-week period state-level positive rate 7.5 past two week 7.5 take wider view past 2 month state-wide positive rate 7.2 keep current rate growth 73 jul 1 would expect see 1,964 new case since today 140 per day increase 59 per day compare current period 
anyone miss comment similar post hispanic latinx individual over-represented covid-19 case 73 case far june among hispanic latinx individual 14 durham county resident identify hispanic latinx quick blame outdoor protest phase 2 reopenings hair salon tattoo shop rise case durham make sense give data hispanic folk make anywhere near majority customers/workers hair salon tattoo shops retail store place reopen recently durham certainly make outdoor protester recent week mention outbreak tie protest anyways nc elsewhere june far great number case know employment information occur among people work construction people live work nursing care facility people unemployed look like need focus approach case well outreach affected community instead blanket lockdown 
walk 9th street time today like 15 people wear mask well shit y'all 
many people come complacent news covid data look care much reading 
test nursing home prison jerk data around even frustrated people refuse believe anything state say anything science prof 
really like way present information rate growth new case although agree face value could easily misinterpret reporting source provide look icu bed ventilator usage etc think u become numb number case represent interest would case progress treat represent icu bed ventilator usage etc also data provide normalization test mean spike around memorial day true spike detect case may right person ask something genuinely curious please forgive covered post 
point 100 line fair remove future graphic think original thought hey let least work get 100 reality 105 v 95 growth case still really bad either way 0 net case equal previous period go forward 
rate thing get bad get well 
social distance hike fall lake weekend saw huge gathering probably 100 hispanic people multigenerational bbq'ing swim party shook head disbelief surprise number 
someone propose new stay-at-home mean blanket lockdown 
nothing wrong tire covid news certainly long people continue understand virus spread accelerate fine tune keep wear mask sit outside restaurant possible try stay 6 foot people much possible 
right ya know 
mostly focus durham co publish source metric durham co able normalize testing level reliable count test do durham co reporting process apparently maintain level detail require state calculate unfortunately link durham dashboard state-wide dashboard report state-level positive rate provide counter-balance fact durham test count case go 2 reason increase spread increase test increase due test expect see positive rate come time conversely virus spread would expect see positive rate stay steady perhaps rise positive rate nc overall steadily increase probably safe assume increase spread part reason increase case 
thanks guess overall thought simply might best descriptive statistic try sum state covid durham simple time series case per day would likely intuitive people see differential trend line easily use interesting visualization hop someone would create plot time series new case vs hospitalization latter data available ncdhhs help u try normalize variance test capability also maybe get sense whether disease become less dangerous whatever reason speculate 
interesting anecdotal evidence perhaps outdoor area less risky certain situation assume refer outdoor construction site 
unfortunately see similar instance hike well spot actually know case trace cluster reveal large party family gathering source spread combine housing issue closer live quarter minority population construction site 
mean blanket lockdowns response people think cooper another round stay home order like do march response rise cases/hospitalizations mayor delayed phase 2 reopenings due rise case hispanic community week delay appear anything edit refer durham county public health director rod jenkins say notice strong uptick number coronavirus infection latino community say concern durham personal care business beauty salon barber shops restaurant swim pool allow reopen least june 1 even though gov roy cooper announce business open part state start friday 5 p.m delay phase 2 nothing stop uptick rise case within latino community 
kind assume case follow link try find would contend currently social norm get test feel confirmation test random test implement although probably situation contribute thanks representation 
time series case per day available durham public health dept 
essentially acceleration graph agree immediately intuitive metric simple way account test rate would percent test positive state health dept publish weekly bulletin think also useful see absolute number case incl hospitalization death make point big plenty people think problem nyc big city kind growth curve keep scale perspective even acknowledge function number test 
outdoor construction sit iirc poorly ventilate interior indoor construction section mostly issue like hvac install drywall etc contrast road construction landscaping 
sure exactly get add original stay-at-home order exception construction essential business would seem make sense repeat stay-at-home order current cluster appear burn way construction worker family ought something like get tiny chunk trillion federal relief dollar pay construction worker take 2-3 week isolate get everybody free convenient test setup free voluntary quarantine hotel anybody test positive send free food affect family isolate home instead would guess currently poor soul county health department desperately call people encourage wash hand 
maybe probably lot say exist living condition predictor spread give majority case deaths far durham come correctional facility nurse home would wager increase community due close living condition 
people get sick necessarily one transmit virus 
weekly bulletin include positive test rate county since analysis durham co would need number test do county say data available share link 
ask question last week reply exactly say fwiw though see evidence incline believe intuitively think honest 
yeah local health department definitely try figure unfortunately lot material receive state english rush create messaging languages account cultural difference hell even struggle figure effective messaging english take year public health campaign normalize seatbelt use decade ago need much fast masks/hand washing/social distancing convince people build habit since basically wait 2 year u vaccinate 
people get sick necessarily one transmit virus asymptotic spread pretty rare 95 case mild severe symptom le 5 asymptomatic simply state fact say asymptomatics rare truly 
sure county report positive test rate understand county actually ability drill data get real number get approximation miss data state access one problem data report lot go state distributes county also weird rule around exactly report get bit screwy test include final count depend lab test person test multiple time lab different labs entity like cv require report anything test 
become big problem internet misspoke info correct afterward asymptomatic different presymptomatic anyone rove around like normal could presymptomatic nonethess even asymptomatic rate transmission kind good idea wear gd mask durham give whole death thing

still see clusters/outbreaks related outdoor protest three week ago keep mind decide accost group people sit around outside park table somewhere 
percentage cases/deaths nurse home jail prison 
notice number case go test little additional death wake bee 42 death nothing get overly work virus play self hide forever 
follow post seem rate increase acceleration go track correctly long number positive number still get bad right edit acceleration actually term look thanks 
yeah agree general avoid accost people 
say outbreak happen yet happen expect genuinely curious since would amaze major spike due protest 
know top head county datahub site lot underlie demographic information 
weekly data reflection iirc basically construction job take place indoors outdoors drive number people blame rise case take look eye opening 
definitely play question many hundred thousand kill process already near 120,000 5-ish country get plenty room growth 
decide next step latinos 10 population 44 case 7 death state wide death go much mostly young people like latino get case 
right acceleration new case go change net new case still positive mean overall case load still grow 
think good durham seem take mask wear social distancing seriously raleigh 
acceleration go velocity 0 would mean constant velocity compare total number case compare total number new case unit case per time time denominator velocity 
go guess protest hugely impactful wear mask distance guess crowd move lot key element distance time linger around person breath face likely get sick get sick 
cases/hospitalizations drop new york minnesota home big outdoor protest 
u go right think single important thing wear mask especially others wear mask lead example put mask around friend family group remember polite cough cover mouth thing serious wear mask ffs 
another key element outside 
great point start feel like get back pretty close normal life collectively good mask discipline get growth rate new case 0 keep hospital still say good shape definition whatever habit people follow work indefinitely vaccine mean everyone wear mask try best avoid large crowd win book
