north carolina report record spike covid-19 case friday 
make sense people surprise number spike since people thing since phase 2 start 
also first child state die 
believe dashboard show even high number yesterday saturday 1,389 recall correctly edit check 1,370 yesterday 
mean wont move phase 3 late june 
long linear growth exponential think stay track towards open speculation real test fall weather change 
good news look like hospitalization flatten test positivity rate do spike next question whether positivity rate fall back towards 5 whether get stuck 7 
test positivity 9 also hospitalization probably lag 1-2 week 
hospitalisation 200 people since begin phase 1 like 500 700 
7 day smooth 7.3 leveling pattern individual day positivity volatile really useful 
uh oh n.c dhhs report big discrepancy two data source one correct 
anyone know find detailed daily mecklenburg covid-19 statistic 
hi guy use pull sen jackson post usually statistic see one see statistic usually go coronavirus page check like something county specifically anyone good resource sort information thanks much

maybe help 
thanks much information 
covid-19 page choose county 
mandy cohen powerpoint file 
agree best data get lot thing would informative available tableau real-time basis length stay hospitalized demographic information hospitalize icu v normal hospitalization information change hospitalization criterion focus hotspot test drive test number i.e focused test congregate care facility food packaging plant etc 
like see hospitalization age range idea data available 
age breakdown near bottom page 
gov cooper say reopen gym bar table covid-19 case north carolina continue rise 
know beat old drum really reason bar close taproom open restaurant stay open 2am serve customer bar area justification bar remain closed gym well entirely different conversation 
still yet see logical plan people suppose workout gym together everyone already use sanitation wipe know people go wipe dumbbell machine handle barbell oh locker room see work even limit capacity open back gym require allow people get contract without buyout pay monthly fee usual half-ass sanitation maintenance 
problem gym mix bag one hand want open want people stay healthy fit public health important especially something like covid also gyms tend small business passionate local ownership stay close long hurt giant soulless corporation neighbor go financial life support hand indoors many share surface gyms one nightmarish place try ensure kind sterile cleaning protocol bar understand let restaurant open limited capacity issue bar try argue place open allow restaurant limited capacity hold back bar fundamental reason treat differently 
governor position completely illogical make sense shut everything march make sense open everything back number even bad march people naive impression save economy simply ignore reality virus go work way virus spread exponentially people see friends relative get sick fear also spread exponentially lucky enough avoid outcome like nyc italy spain luck simply lead overconfidence underestimation threat eventually reach point almost everyone scar go restaurant gym may happen summer may happen fall weather condition exacerbate spread people scar send kid school daycare force child care try make living experience domino effect layoffs across economy affect front-line worker also back office white collar worker bank meanwhile unemployment money dry state local government face existential crisis bankruptcy blm movement morph much wider social unrest much large number people face food insecurity political leader ball mandate mask political ramp test contact trace trump wo politician failed meet challenge 
drive restaurant charlotte weekend pack 0 social distance think fair keep gym close long machine space wipe everywhere especially since gyms primary way lot people stay shape 
screw gym reopen movie theater theater easily maintain social distancing 
issue bar taproom even restaurant later hour everyone early evening pretty good use good judgement follow rule become intoxicated judgement start affect everyone start lose inhibition start get close start conversation stranger hook louder music start yell speak think everything open maybe cutoff time 10 
accord cooper scientist covid absolutely hat establishment serve food avoids target identical establishment kitchen existence cook area make establishment 70 resistant covid19 
feel would look really bad state open bar church 
hit video workout home basic set dumbbell rubber mat work wonder miss machine get ta get ta 
honestly caseload increase surprise another stay home order low curve stop spread virus bad thing reopen case 
say best set necessarily safe pf rock hill get job do pretty well extra worker two ensure everything sanitize constantly plus gym-goers pretty respectful clean everything ask time come close contact person gym ask many set leave even cardio machine spread machine usable also allow 50 capacity honesty everything socially-distanceable make word mean around 6 ft away somebody long youre front area dumbbell otherwise good big question would super tiny mom n pop gym handle pf huge plenty space one tiny gym worry 
let people take responsibility 
also horse race play devil advocate 1 people come restaurant discrete time/purpose hour whatever leave people come bar hang generalize think get idea 2 bar people definition drink alcohol lead relaxed behaviour safety people restaurant necessarily drink alcohol obviously exception get alcohol restaurant might come bar quick beer leave etc try understand different treatment come would lot sympathy personal responsibility argument see much anti-mask sentiment remember mask protect protect people 
well incorrect assume logic march logic back little information virus hospital system ready mask healthcare worker wear short supply production ramp many pandemic related item virus originally think mortality rate 4 base early data base mostly severe case present hospital rather minor case never need go hospital cdc estimate total mortality rate 0.4 order magnitude severe flu strain context furthermore since build test ability several treatment trial stage furthermore see counterfactual country like sweden never lock get hammer like everyone say would top long go people go suffer side effect lockdowns real economy tank 14 percent unemployed people lose livelihood learn lot since march lot head towards able safely reopen 
make sense shut everything march 
eventually reach point almost everyone scar go restaurant gym restaurant least 4 night week since re-opening look back 
every business give fair chance reopen except gym really add people give chance make decision gym worth ok dont go 
actually good point really think theater charlotte assign seat 
fair get health inspect least 
perhaps something drunk people make bad decision even unfair 
one seem problem taproom open 
need happen wo 
agree sign public health waiver go sick healthcare cost 100 
4 estimate one many estimate many estimate significantly high make credible source see case 4 still 4x deadly flu also factor unlike flu population immunity virus go spread widely another factor high rate hospitalization people forget many survivor come away huge medical bill severely traumatize illness mentally physically icu several week change trajectory life especially old sweden counter example one thing pretty high death rate much high country lock secondly lock significant extent voluntarily rather government order article sweden lead epidemiologist acknowledges sweded fuck exactly warn virus surge fear prevent people resume normal activity hurt economy regardless government order even make argument another lockdown go happen whether like government lockdown really solve problem solves problem pretty simple wear mask course test trace bizarre part people would rather wear mask save 1000 life billion dollar economic loss go learn hard lesson end still lot uncertainty treatment probably arrive point make big difference likely reach population late year lucky like predict stock market way predict certainty best guess get hit another surge unable recover economically near future go take year reach point hospital get overwhelm probably fall thing might mitigate people finally change behavior thing get bad people change behavior hard predict 
well enjoy point may see restaurant go business lock take aggressive enough measure control virus wear mask test trace etc 
guy cornaviruses get bud 
yeah establish virus order magnitude less deadly originally think suck let people make choice 
sell limit number seat allow people sit every 3rd seat income movie theater well absolutely income amc one best theater company ready file bankruptcy 
go hang bar get drink nearly every restaurant open right fly saucer o'charley chili longhorn boardwalk billy picasso moosehead roco ed tavern beer garden could go paragraphs place bar area open full people hang around drink remain bar place open tiny fraction whole industry already open edit plus brewery open nothing people hang around drink maybe food say ok list place open place like blind pig example make sense pig similar layout spot table bar seat regulate plus vetoed bill go force place like pig seat 100 50 capacity outdoors pretty imbalanced application restriction 
cuz ya baptist get ta go somewhere 
would completely kill economy think liberal/republicans start think stay home order bad idea way early open want flatten curve/prevent infection

aw fuck 
overall surprise surprised see average age death drop like rock though 
ok criminal misuse statistic take outlier value specifically bind range give outsized influence average try claim trend order climate change denier cherry-pick start end year range make look like average temperature flat decade 
really wish know kind additional health issue young victim terrify news healthy every way strike covid 
kind make sense though say kill lot people say 2 people 20 die recently assume average 70 still 2 week could well outlier various noise data young people go wear mask huge number nurse home lock everyone stick house since spread much young people undoubtedly kill young people overall case number grossly unreported population 
definitely unclear average age last 2 week low overall though 
really though say kill young people whole time young people tell invincible stop precaution 
2/740=.27 frighten imo minimize trip need/want take wear mask public indoors wash hand okay 
could nice know time pretty unlikely completely healthy really unlucky indication young people high risk clt anywhere else 
stats ya dig em 42.3 case meck age 20-39 6/14 death list 20 time data county even without include new case death rate 07 almost 80 infection demographic minority make assumption decent amount people may best health care access underlie health issue think anything healthy young people go hide young people meck probably die homicide car wreck overdose year would die ever single 20-39 year old county infect edit read two death cabarrus find data 20 somethings die meck death rate 0 
agree article mention health official say two recent death people 20 one person 40 1 person 20 cabarrus county assume 0 mecklenburg 
sound like try downplay bad virus obviously situation lead long term health impact much like virus young people likely majority subreddit worth freak part protect vulnerable best mitigate risk 99.93 chance make even get virus spread risk 12-18 mo period vaccine daily risk essentially 0

covid-19 case go nearly 20 one week mecklenburg county 
7,131 june 15th 8,752 morning june 22nd.source think increase test premature re-opening lack people wear ppe quite concerned 
since test go best data point use right test stabilizes hospitalization rate accord nc dhhs covid dashboard covid hospitalization go 797 845 past week 6 tell yes positive due test still people become ill enough admit hospital 
john hopkins test positivity rate slightly high low month ago hold fairly steady around 7-7.5 great also insanely high rt reproductive rate 1.03 1 bad much high 1 long story short nc slow roll outbreak rapid increase also drop lot place u bad shape probably skim along rate virus run accessible spreader rt start trend point fall 1 outbreak effectively collapse also note place rt well 1 place large outbreak seem way 
people take seriously test hospitalization well case spike definitely concern 
one wear mask work since optional feel paranoid 
group party home neighborhood week 12 people easy weekend night number house turn garage mini nightclubs packed people drink grind add numerous crowd see public place act like never hear pandemic wonder case rise 
many fatality people get get sick enough hospitalize die single death whole state population 10 million age 25 source 
davidson go harris teeter shock employee one mask 
always go spike reopen matter reopen many layer mask glove make individual wear wanted room hospital people need 
place really go dilworth harris teeter south end lowe see basically everyone wear mask maybe 2-3/10 
never see something overblown life disease pray day look back say damn really overreact nothing everything back normal 
nothing data nc dhhs show concern virus past month 5/21/2020 6/21/2020 total 845 people currently hospitalize v 53,000 case increase 247 people 30 day past 30 day increase test 150 number confirm case increase 162 however total hospitalization increase 45 5/21/2020 6/21/2020 443,487 test complete 32,679 positive case positive test rate 7.36 compare start pandemic prior 5/21/2020 302,288 test 20,112 positive case 6.65 positive test rate show positive test rate remain flat throughout entirety pandemic dhhs website show 3,223 licensed icu bed north carolina 1,756 use 54 use get covid mean go icu hospitalization mean icu information total hospital bed across state 845 covid patient close overwhelming hospital capacity sense see spike death daily death drop mean either 1 hospitalization rate drop few people diagnose covid hospitalize 2 hospitalization rate flat increase people recover quickly stay hospital long data dhhs positive nothing data show concern trend potential outcome 
need look new case positive rate positive rate trend since bottom late-may see data meck health department combine test people concerned 
test 100 patient right count positive test covid hospitalization people thing either false positive asymptomatic definitely inflate number mean case go hospitalization metric flaw 
entirely likely inflated hospital number reflect people go hospital procedure miss month test positive even though asymptomatic rest number justification drastic reaction murky best hospital covid hospital covid 
test anywhere near enough test level percent positive go steadily less 1 fact percent positive hold steady 7-10 suggests fail necessary look country successfully mitigate death economic damage test trace mask key response level nowhere near level need also nowhere near close reach herd immunity would bring r0 still year away even reach herd immunity outbreak necessarily collapse slowly tapper herd immunity reach 60 expect another 20-30 get infect virus taper currently 8-10 infected nc mean 1/8 way epidemic assume immunity last significant amount time potential last rest life pretty unlikely theoretical possibility course way vaccine clear though vaccine arrive sooner reach herd immunity naturally 
really fuck disgust work matthew area downtown area crowd people eat congregate outside one street along cigar lounge eatery saw 40-50 people one person wear mask gotdamn shame 
circle-k morning person saw wear mask 
wear mask anytime indoor space others—grocery drug store home depot etc think good idea work wise as say hey look stupid mask reply would well difference me—i look stupid stupid 
alone feel way keep right thing 
issue hospitalization room hospital people need become problem 
consider australia able reopen covid-19 case show complete shutdown would result less coronavirus case 
also hear cv test report positive case number test true could probably explain lot jump positive 
look ncdhhs data page literally say ncdhhs survey hospital across north carolina daily monitor current hospitalization due covid-19 current capacity emphasis add data hospitalization strictly patient admit respiratory illness positive covid-19 test find evidence count asymptomatic patient 
hospitalize covid hospitalize covid amount thing hospital bed take run hospital bed thing start get ugly 
see point report hospital non covid reason test positive covid despite asymptomatic send home since need bed wo count toward hospitalization also never say data point justification drastic reaction 
obviously want rate much possible practical limit also demand limit many test perform day unless want start forcibly jam swabs nose test readily available process reasonable amount time do job term scale test herd immunity actually far complicate post implies one thing vaccine-derived herd immunity kermack-mckendrick model great randomly distribute vaccine back-of-envelope calculation start fall apart want consider naturally reach smart herd immunity node likely transmit also likely become infect previous outbreak burn far low disease prevalence expect base standard model frankly know limit likely far low standard model call furthermore seroprevalence test start develop serious issue see mild asymptomatic infection possibly resolve cellular immunity antibody produce produce low number possibly make survey vast underestimate good reason suspect know magnitude realistically nyc might represent bad case term detectable prevalence good overshoot throw regard long-term cellular immunity best model sars1 show immunity go decade longer guarantee course best guess 
dog fracture pelvis day take animal hospital would let u build dog time bleed rectum worry might something really bad right across street bar pack full people girlfriend go another couple first time since whole thing start go sycamore think really open would sit away everyone able get beer people stack top regard wo go back anytime soon needless say kind upset people handeling mean shouldnt shut viable people need least smart 
people go cigar lounge already idgaf anyone attitude really surprise 
go get takeout restaurant yesterday father day one mask restaurant employee top get lot look customer wear mask like moron 
see 
think put u phase 2 already lose control think know try would ignore local official nothing would enforce 
ha ha ha naive majority people choose wear mask make political statement cooper drive dishonest try lay cooper foot 
wear outdoors keep visibility guy wear mask know probably necessary people see others wear mask less pressure feel wear one indoors look stupid stupid great literally dgaf dumb look mask wear glove grocery store even throw big jacket extra protection feel like give lot old person look impress anyone give shit look like energy 33-year-old 
would stop elective medical procedure first start set bed thats know hospital bed look short step arent take though jeff jackson late post note unclear hospitalization number reflect number patient hospital covid number patient treat covid dont even know hospitalization number mean 
sorry show hospital non covid reason test positive test everyone see send home still need hospital non covid issue think ops point something saw sen jackson mention yesterday people go hospital issue hold go remain hospital reason test positive may still count covid patient even covid reason hospital sorry make sense 
think say need proof say go appendicitis happen test positive symptom would count covid-19 hospitalization 
immunity question still many unknown stretch assume decade-long immunity low probability scenario base epidemiologists heard likely 1-2 year antibody test also may pick coronaviruses like common cold test may estimate number infect people large number false positive agree however post simplistic herd immunity question lot unknown could play scenario put forth best guess relatively low confidence however test question would strongly disagree economy lose trillion dollar lose productivity massive testing contact trace would essentially mitigate economic damage keep virus control allow people get back mostly normal life think stake need massively ramp test trace trace part key want test people randomly want test anyone come contact infect person way pragmatically app app could significantly cast wide net identity people get test exactly country like south korea reason 
good mask glove likely good though soon touch anything go you—glasses wallet key credit card phone—you may well wear 
wear mask outside normalize 
would stop elective medical procedure first start set bed already 
comment raise question 1 person go hospital something put like elective surgery would certainly turn away covid asymptomatically 2 admitted emergency test positive covid would certainly report positive test language ncdhhs website suggests would covid hospitalization ncdhhs survey hospital across north carolina daily monitor current hospitalization due covid-19 current capacity emphasis add think need clarification due covid-19 mean answer question 
see say example appendectomy almost always outpatient would take bed would report cli surveillance program think language website make clear ncdhhs survey hospital across north carolina daily monitor current hospitalization due covid-19 current capacity emphasis add would report positive covid test look like report covid hospitalization 
see happen wi mi 
yeah start come conclusion recently plus wear glove make confident touch thing door handle railing would normally touch think stop go back wash hand contact like 
undid let thing resume 
example probably best count concern jeff jackson talk last update may happen look policy level 
covid-19 play 
false choice covid serious threat specifically elderly vulnerable magic bullet come stop choice progress slowly back towards normal keep eye hospitalization make sure overwhelm medical system 
question poorly word fill bias however bite essential employee really major modification day-to-day could give fly damn anyone patience simple fact perfect virus cripple america proper preventive measure require 1 people unified response 2 people work towards goal 3 people generally give damn 4 common sense none thing currently present united state right get karen flip shit burning mask meatheads flip roid rage ca go gym people turn political issue issue public well safety know nation almost do mess stay home wore mask wash hand fight merica get fight power mask make sheep come take yer gun job everything unconstitutional yeah found father plan global pandemic writing bill right lowly fast food manager day since pandemic start constantly worry catch thing one many droves non-mask-wearing it's-just-the-flu moron come location daily put fuck mask shut serious virus affect everyone differently highly communicable want thing go back normal buckle cause want thing open though stand line social distance wear mask stop fuck complain everything 
create account ask stupid fuck question 
still soon know long term effect virus many unknown still virus well cautious lot people live life differently imagine medium underplayed virus 
10 day ago would say blow since last monday though 12 people actually know use interact regular basis test positive 45 fence wait see case resolve 
jump back life number improve many people refuse wear masks people take seriously bad news second wave fall 
100 threat time overplay reaction overreaction thats harm good elderly vulnerable odds death real young get 1 chance die likely show symptom fly home parent birthday think give terrify anti-science anti-mask bullshit far far bad anti-vax imo however 100 blame since 4 month start still hard find proper n94 mask reasonable price think ideally store would free mask outside patreons wear make mandatory law thats supply chain setup think bad close business even mean people die unpopular opinion life important however think preserve economy equally important people go work make stuff run stuff sure give people money unemployed eventually money buy exist stuff without create new stuff 
think still serious threat v think way played medium por que los do obviously serious number comparison far far bad spanish flu ridiculous 
people research find mortality rate quickly drop due test fatigue also big issue see less masks day go worn mask since protest medium say protestors fine people protest lockdown support business mandatory face mask 
meatheads flip roid rage ca go gym yeah one problem rage take deep breath buddy 
live life differently order case would already hermit whole thing 
number comparison far far bad spanish flu ridiculous sheer number sure ridiculous term percentage spot globally estimate morbidity 1918 h1n1 outbreak 3.4 10 current morbidity base actual number estimate covid-19 5.1 number likely high due lack test u actually track slightly high rest world see huge decrease daily infection death v spike number global estimate h1n1 case around 500m keep mind pandemic start spring 1918 last 4 wave spring 1920 current case covid-19 shy 10m remember uncontrolled spread exponential get 500m matter week couple month careful 
want genuine feedback would color question term like over-played worn thin would ask opinion medium handle feel city/county/state/country response come stir shit 
get response real people reddit fairly close far variance opinion go 
think wrong way refer people take seriously may work whole thing people roam target walmart ht publix without mask act like hoax 
laugh everyone start try inspirational living fear cautious base unknown surround novel virus people always say need common sense people go whatever want unless force wear mask close bar etc simply people take advantage freedom instead cautious considerate 
honestly clue deliberate social distancing others pretty care free think month home flatten curve fear may way forward lockdown gradual opening lockdown gradual opening see report texas issue around daycare center also concern lead believe school fall may remote learn 
stay home never kill disease impossible without vaccine keep hospital overwhelm scientist start see dangerous virus even previously healthy individual unfortunately really know long-term health impact recover read account covid survivor see immediate aftermath pretty unless case mild asymptomatic even clear long-term effect take seriously unknown 
moron fucking moron 
mortality high due lack test know stats work mortality decrease test bc find case young people die even show symptom bad spanish flu kill roughly 5 world population okay w take seriously people understand make comparison interpret statistic need lay hyperbole 
globally estimate morbidity 1918 h1n1 outbreak 3.4 10 current morbidity base actual number estimate covid-19 5.1 use estimate spanish flu actual number covid compare apple orange use estimate actual estimate covid low 26 high around 1 best estimate around 4 global estimate h1n1 case around 500m global estimate death range 17 million 50 million world 2 billion people currently 8 billion would need hit bare minimum 68 million death hit low estimate even high estimate even break 1 million far reason think even get close number 
good thing live sc 
laugh everyone start try inspirational living fear like tell live fear crowd sure ask dentist dr wear mask procedure 
global estimate death range 17 million 50 million world 2 billion people moron ca compare number death number people disingenuous say 19 people die space flight make really safe ca die rocket never ride one know sure may ever one use estimate spanish flu actual number covid compare apple orange use estimate actual estimate covid low 26 high around 1 best estimate around 4 first estimate h1n1 record test information share 100 year ago like today know sure many people die h1n1 1918~1920 second compare actual number covid know many people may currently yet diagnose know many people currently may die many may still get recover die safe vaccine develop go 2 3 year seasonal flu go wane anything get much much bad contain current flare-up even 1st wave already talk 2nd wave third compare confirmed death estimate case 26 1 incredibly disingenuous like idiot say 99.9 percent survival rate like spaceflight example ca die disease like example know if/when might get statistic probability work real life response u/belovedkid tie previous paragraph good number deaths case china russia secretive/secluded country like n korea libya et al anything get place go altered make thing look good russia socialize healthcare great morbidity rate likely high global average terrible private insurance-based system morbidity rate currently see 5.1 likely high due hidden figure guestimate base best number cdc come final morbidity rate somewhere 1.6 3.5 circle back around rocket example 560 train astro/cosmonauts 19 kill put morbidity around 3.4 end covid chance die astronaut die flight 
moron swine flu u alone adjust population would kill around 2 million people current pace covid need around 3-4 year even adjust variance mortality demographic entire nation build 60 year old immunocompromised people learn ya math bruh bruh

u.s covid-19 new case day evolution 15 state daily case 10 march 23 june 
charlotte handle covid-19 
live work normally wfh right uptown last night decide get fresh air take walk around central charlotte mask list thing saw:1 valhalla 80 capacity zero mask on2 black life matter mural beautiful important group people bike stunt hug greet people arrived3 multiple cash food truck operate normal levels4 several great restaurant go good queen city q american burger co gone5 estimate 30 people mask even few pretend care social distancing despite numerous sign tell so6 trolley pub operation service exercise consume liquid within less foot people wear mask street.in short new charlotte general love city people pretty quick embrace last night disappoint face crisis show true color turn responsible enough well show responsibility prove deserve call queen city 
think bad head south end 
wish shock disturbing people take seriously come life death still enough people right thing 
surprised smh 
pretty disappointing hear 
thank saw story yesterday breweries south end cough sycamore cough go total shock know host live music without significant capacity restriction mask distance south end demographic disproportionately responsible spike case need accountability 
wear mask get bar wear eat drinking seem make lot sense 
bad see sycamore jesus christ thing pack covid 
whole time think mediocre beer would downfall wonder someone go step shut 
south end demographic disproportionately responsible spike case actual source back claim pulling as 
live thankfully move soon one apartment complex sycamore see crowd inspire comment 
yeah time cmpd stop harassing protestors actual job business need make example texas shut and/or suspend liquor license bar observe rule texas 
demographic necessarily population know study do charlotte specifically city prove way highly doubt virtuous exception young people need often therefore likely carrier cdc anthony fauci pretty vocal ny time article sum pretty well albeit completely unbiased source echo see raw literature 
covid-19 case u.s evolution 15 state case new update untill 27 june 
skip end 
race bar chart need die 
coronavirus update 
know go infection2020 stats news phase 3 go happen schedule timing place maybe open early 
consider pandemic still go everyone gather group country protest doubt still wait see happens next week case skyrocket worried go phase 3 could end back phase 1 start spread 
consider thousand people gather rally last week still able open bar 
dumb like day care open know viral/bacterial breeding ground protest hundred thousand people small area governor even march protestors definitely follow six foot rule meanwhile restaurant bar gyms remain closed business owner hell time employee struggle even still arent get ui gym example one face face thing work also numerous wipes/spray clean equipment member choose governor dumb hell im voting as others way state handle covid terrible many people rightfully deserve ui pay tax get nothing still wait 
ask governor guess 
yeah consider event last two week national pandemic strategy herd immunity fast possible whether want keep bar gym close protester stand inch apart yell loud kinda like patient come bullet wound doctor decides put bandaid paper cut call good 
read cooper veto bill would open completely ridiculous say safe restaurant/bars brewery open bar without food even though go forced keep customer outside also ridiculous claim base fuck science one single action kind turn cooper go brewery restaurant/bar go see people congregate inside drinking like bar without food brew site apparently define characteristic place make bar unsafe lack brewing cooking operation coronavirus love kind place hang often 
thats one point personally dont understand gym thing everything go dont see issue gym open 50 capacity thats opinion 
know noda brew seat inside really looked location 
hilariously hypocritical message pandemic become last day imagine lot politician go join everyone else unemployment line come november 
yet put cook top inside becomes perfectly safe 50 capacity lol 
coronavirus case u.s evolution 15 state case 1 march 2 june 
coronavirus case per 100k mecklenburg county 
active case cumulative active seem relevant focus hospital ability provide care 
would like know number hospitalization mecklenburg county 
graph show cumulative number confirm coronavirus case per 100,000 resident source access active case number would love see 
fear coronavirus case mecklenburg leader push face mask requirement 
god please fuck simple enforce shit private company 
really wish requirement along 
study national academy science conclude wear face mask public corresponds effective mean prevent interhuman transmission also breakdown country mandate mask least mandatory public transportation high area transmission outside household grocery drug store vulnerable people choice visit 
long mean long overdue 
see hardly anyone wear mask past week seem like soon phase two start people think virus magically disappear also think good majority public get news tv tv news put covid aside focus blm movement support cause really unfortunate timing monumental event take place together time 
good 100 support 
mask service 
requirement start people get impatient selfish predict fall completely ruin 
place enforce mask would nice go occasionally spend money every time try 0 adoption poor employee breathe everyone rona 
idea behind wear mask protect others protect others also assume enough people asymptomatic carrier smart enough realize symptom unknowingly spread covid-19 rorschach get thrown prison scene 
president basically mock use mask thousand thousand follow suit change wo tough time see happen thing turn disgust political point one thing trump say time office actually true applies sad 
goddamn south end literally worker wear mask good business everyone else act like skullfucked moron 
oberserver free coronavirus outline link 
recently move charlotte philly still lurk time time absolutely require mask otherwise wo get service ca even enter business 
know wear mask outside health care facility offer little protection infection public health authority define significant exposure covid-19 face-to-face contact within 6 foot patient symptomatic covid-19 sustain least minute say 10 minute even 30 minute chance catch covid-19 pass interaction public space therefore minimal many case desire widespread mask reflexive reaction anxiety pandemic expand masking protocol great contribution may reduce transmission anxiety whatever role may play reduce transmission covid-19 department population medicine harvard medical school harvard pilgrim health care institute m.k brigham woman hospital m.k c.a.m j.s m.p harvard medical school m.k c.a.m e.s.s infection control unit division infectious disease massachusetts general hospital e.s.s boston 
one thing love create precedent expand power government 
really see difference would make indoor business use mask practical already seem require guess order somewhat useful tailor specific circumstance like grocery store worry leader decide go blanket public order even outdoors away people think people ignore unreasonable 
private business since manger bow dumbass customer 
also coincidence event occur time expect see covid economic hardship continue exacerbate inequality cause social unrest meanwhile trump republicans fall poll turn desperate authoritarian anti-democratic mean suppress vote enter perfect storm converge factor likely blm morph wider protest unrest hope enough republican defect work democrat restore science civility democracy country certainly coincidence top five bad hit country run populist authoritarian leader u brazil uk india russia 
post office south blvd require sure enforce everyone mask go 
noda company store real good option allow inside w/o mask 
true idiot-in-chief help situation also true many democrat leader many urban area around country seem reluctant mandate mask almost afraid exercise power afraid rebellion able enforce perhaps fuel policitized culture war think explanation since science pretty clear mask would save life economy 
tone top cooper mandate whatever want city wo matter 
apt pool look like la vega last weekend also feel like part problem one enforcing afraid pissing odd customer base excite possibility require mask 
philly actually lot dense though exceptionally high proportion people use public transit public transit seem one major cause nyc outbreak company office north chicago also downtown start small phase reopen suburb location sound like downtown office reopen necessarily argument mandate quite apple apple compare still interesting data point 
first link sent opinion piece study nowhere article reference study another study mask among others recently come also op-ed comment effectiveness mask contract virus transmit word assume person infect wear mask often case hospital set different situation infect potential recipient wear mask even say article compel possibility wear mask may reduce likelihood transmission asymptomatic minimally symptomatic health care worker covid-19 provider patient misinterpretation article perspective protect individual health care worker talk mask wear ability reduce r0 overall rate transmission within population actually mention quote pass central point article lastly hint bias article try convince health care worker use precious n95s short supply quite frankly suspicious everytime hear medical industrial complex financial incentive keep health care worker job high risk situation without proper ppe health care worker fully inform risk many would walk job without proper n95s look asian country wear mask universally accept general population also expert place like south korea arguably do best job country control virus south korean chinese government actually supply n95s citizen thing would concede evidence level absolute proof wear non-n95s significantly effective preponderance evidence suggest mask significantly effective panacea significant tool arsenal many study come airborne transmission common surface asymptomatic spread responsible lion share transmission confluence factor suggest use mask primary risk mitigation strategy 
think really expansion power government already prohibit number activity threaten public health like smoke indoors drink drive etc drunk drive kill 10k per year whereas covid-19 kill 120k month also cause trillion dollar worth damage put thing perspective covid-19 significant crisis lifetime ripple effect far beyond disease wear mask seem like pretty small sacrifice relative potential harm exactly government protect public good rather special interest kind precedent welcome government actually everyone interest rather select 
wear mask may perceive unreasonable westerner much longer hold out accept ongoing spread sars-2 virus result covid19 disease impact potentially impact relative friend older young covid19 hit closer home people may view mask much reasonable e.g many european vary degree quickly adapt par taiwan singapore south korea mask cultural norm limit spread cold limit exposure pollution smoke burn vegetation etc westerner continue accept possibility covid19 infection several month effective treatment ideally become available maybe year ever safe effective vaccine may become available never la effective vaccine decade since hiv sars1 initially spread stage view wear mask public remain dynamic consequently reasonable unreasonable use mask limit spread may change people time tell 
hopeful minimum chilling effect idea corona okay gather party group 
clearly exchange show room debate like early day pandemic like argue lock everyone base know people give choice whether find necessary wear mask base evidence individual business able make policy regard mask statewide mandate absurd jury still yesterday group scientist challenge methodology study claim mask significantly reduces spread another issue fanatical focus mitigation action less important hand wash keep distance mask protective eye covering may also add protective benefit though evidence le clear cut add derek chu assistant professor mcmaster university co-led work say people understand wear mask alternative physical distancing eye protection basic measure hand hygiene think cautious declare science settle 
well agree science settle absence proof equate proof absence unlike give people unproven drug little risk wear mask weight evidence point wear mask course hand wash social distancing also important need block avenue transmission use multiple method however many situation people force situation socially distance like grocery store everybody need food yet grocery store people come within 6 foot point wear mask seem like good practice kind setting think people choice setting people right shop food safe manner need everything err side safety environment lastly ideally wear n95 mask another fiasco response virus n95s significantly effective manufacturing mask rocket science ramp domestic production rather rely chinese would another tool mitigation relatively cheap cost reason people become fanatical issue politicize idiot-in-chief country mask wear controversial touchy subject something people respect others society divide politicize absurd issue like mask wearing 
individual business could set policy regard mask people feel safe go another store costco require masks example people convince mask necessary shop food people agree argument make choose wear mask choose unless require private business think government right make law manner evidence fully settle allow give much power abuse mean burden prove mask necessary like prove marijuana public health hazard arbitrary law create problem police result many law add another arbitrary law may incidents police may force unnecessarily engage someone wear mask saw example nyc clearly worth society respect preference individual business world would better place 
think raise valid point many law want reason police engage people however think sound reason require absolute proof mask effectiveness urgent crisis little cost harm wear mask already sufficient evidence far theory people choose business require mask standard right libertarian argument think fall short case impact wear mask go far beyond boundary store shopper person get infect go infect people go infect people result tree spread across local community even country world people travel individual freedom great expense kill people pandemic make reevaluate many thing think people force get flu shot every year failure kill people unnecessarily lot people die flu every year second hand smoke trade would better force people get flu vaccine let smoke restaurant absolute freedom exist need make tradeoff make sense lastly would say would far well live society people automatically behave benefit common good wore mask without government order really heart libertarianism anarchism however live police state people use follow order also consequently oblivious common good want work way police state mentality would great think mask wear right place start give urgency crisis mask wear completely consistent zillion restriction impose u everyday feel different plenty good place start dismantle police state like legalize drug prostitution gamble etc impact society actually somewhat minimal far harm common good carbon emission take drug case climate change threaten specie ultimate extinction right drive gas guzzler worth specie extinction freedom weigh cost right covid cost many life trillion dollar result depression-era economic collapse mask brainer 
coronavirus case u.s evolution 15 state case 1 march 16 june 
anybody else feel impend sense doom entire south coronavirus hot spot time seem nothing go stop 
downhill moment turn political issue rather common sense issue 
father work one main hospital charlotte respiratory therapist never see stress stay safe guy 
think corona fatigue hit everyone fiance still go strong almost friend completely give try stay safe care mental fatigue american unify non-political response top government would come fatigue level rate still skyrocket instead people trust politician medical expert people textbook idiot 
old man upset wear mask grocery store yell profanity walk wear safety get angry 
nobody seem care lose love one disease fuck sad frustrating 
definitely worried overly worried point thing think 
fwiw look graphs story see even though number report case surge 32k new case friday vs around 18k begin june peak 36k new case april 24 look chart report death trend steadily downward since mid-april number report case really something false signal reality many people virus really particularly bad flu data point interested besides death hospitalisation way could think two separate virus one tough one put hospital kill know north carolina trend steadily term hospitalisation definitely good see comprehensive number anyway still wear mask go would ask people simple courtesy others understand difficult people get selfish 
political division certainly help reality go happen good right thing people want get life stuff live fear shelter place foreseeable future even state strong rule place hit populace care anymore like california yea op expect corona number keep go foreseeable future 
yes absolutely make sure keep steady stock supply hell break loose 
open state give try stop sooner everyone get well want go 
prepared take precaution let go get bad many die economy continue get hit may survive hand make peace live life 
first use common sense problem importantly believe anything msm say especially nytimes 
course want politics distort science fact choose react virus inherently political stark political choice either pull together society look one another say fuck everyone survival fit ultimately come either believe social responsibility believe individualism social responsibility involve protect elderly wearing mask bring food create social safety net work prioritize basic necessity like food consumerism individualism involve stockpile weapon go bar young healthy could care less behavior ultimately kill bunch forgotten elderly nursing home think anything political situation quite frankly teeter edge social chaos hope virus ramp hit close home people eventually realize u share burden control thing could see serious unrest make situation far bad 
november 2016 
thanks share really wish way get good hard information understand go heard many mixed message people situation hospital recently hear someone hospital empty live era fakenews 
wife boat still get takeout regular friday night place keep ask come back stock answer period zero distancing mask way place onmy 50 capacity even reasonable-ish friend like wan na go wwc stay distance like insane yes cabin fever find hobby collectively war-time mindset sacrifice resolve common good go die anyway yolo ammirite ugh tangent stay strong sane 
neighbor start party people bar people enough well bad go lockdown process start kind pointless stay get test mandatory start 
fatigue sure unify approach would prevent fatigue suggest virus deadly originally think death go cite article test capacity significantly rise course go see rise case expect hospitals/ventilators near max capacity therapeutic discover time lessen impact covid lot people always ignore advice medical expert politician really disagree bunch idiot listen medically expert one piece puzzle set public policy medical expert common sense would tell u risk die car crash yet still car massive cost car massive cost keep economy close 
thank fox news 
another good reason enter grocery store increase potential opportunity infection increase chance inconveniently interact expose ignorant shopper 
take start cough near see reaction would 
interesting time day showcases change attitude shop morning usually old people everyone mask even glove shop friday afternoon like business normal shop home depot like super spreader event stop go lowe though staff ppe prepred customer base least 50 pay attention retail shop go start take note day everyone seem strong mindfulness safety others ask please wear glove handle product definitely flux attitude 
corona actually kill people underlying condition 
point cohesive federal state response literally abandon deal wear mask wash hand hope best 
know north carolina trend steadily term hospitalisation definitely good see comprehensive number ya go scroll chart click 7 day average hospitalization 
number case false signal report death lag case 2-4 week original hot spot ny nj ct mi il etc conquer virus since large number hospitalization death control virus overall number continue shrink likely see death rise outbreak south southwest midwest start worsen 
upsetting thing could get life start thing start see friend people go ignore social distance whole time would also take precaution definitely love go sit restaurant bite eat beer watch golf tv enjoy day however every restaurant brewery bar etc slam people social distance wear mask middle ground find people stay home refusing find 
hopefully read post sub change mind r/covid19positive take people month recover 
realize thing _have_ leave house right get everything else deliver expensive saying wo even try slow spread protect people downright cruel selfish 
mean fuck grandma right sooner get good 
many people take seriously give try convince family friends virus mess everyone long term damage still know could possibly affect people asymptotically carry virus understand economy keep move refuse let someone put family danger care anyone wellbeing sure many people refuse take small precaution help stop spread wear mask touch anybody wash/sanitize hand regularly throughout day way people react wear mask around others embarrass sure everyone understand easy compare country even allow walk dog op worried hospital already almost icu capacity hospitalization rise everyday statistically matter time someone know get sick covid rate people spread get viable treatment vaccine fellow americans suddenly start care people stay away 
bad mentality second wave way bad still potentially horizon ca get past unless perform simplest task fact walk building see 50/50 turnout help 
sure let totally overfill hospital die people like new york need refrigerated truck cart dead body awesome 
something like yes also impend sense doom get nothing covid infection 
dont say might survive kill rate virus like 0.5 1 estimate high gon na survive agree everything else take precaution rethink group gathering get someone family isolate isolate isolate 
instead believe guy unlike worldwide news organization know real story 
perhaps best journalism entire country good call lol 
long even hillary assume encouraged state shut republican governor would stay open spite 
lie employee cmc main 
go lockdown snowball chance hell happen honestly much likely go stage three next week 
lot misinformation current estimate mortality 5-1 cost fall ill simply die serious financial psychological physical effect get sick without die current exponential rate growth likely hospital get overwhelmed charlotte change behavior people realize early stage thing especially charlotte moment arrive like spain italy nyc arrive long nothing curb exponential growth lastly lot promise drug pipeline 1 proven work randomize trial reduce death steroid study uk yes likely drug come even reason try delay spread drug available yet mass spread go result death spread 6-12 month drug available 
unified approach would reduce spread considerably would outbreak terrible almost every country centralize government response fare considerably well u.s government initially deny existence leave free-for-all governor car crash analogy applicable medical expert chime car crash hence safety belt air bag considerable structure requirement implement year car safety requirement change wildly since invention automobile proper mix allow medical expert politician work together combine strength create unified approach never happen politician leave right buckle public medical expert watch virus turn serious threat 
finally one common sense wisdom also like point ventilator sort last resort study show 10 survival rate even optimistic view actual effectiveness 25-50 whole world eradicate virus learn live wait literally every virus 
agree think take foot throttle bit prevention less afraid covid-19 even economic fallout cultural shift failure highlight medium seemingly completely abandon journalistic responsibility click controversy people continue lose faith expert authority instead trust whoever say thing make feel good degree good covid prove deadly scientist fear truly fucked get hit truly deadly bug lot people go die first enter post-fact era enter post-science era revert back full system think relies emotion belief 
yes escalate situation dumbass always right answer 
matter catch covid die 
right meant see nc hospitalisation number national one 
drive maine past week i-85 i-95 shock see almost everyone wearing mask stop nc va pa ct like someone flip switch soon crossed va border figure bad everywhere apparently 
good point lag discuss many time look report case without reference number test mislead meant 
think people need well educate get mean even asymptomatic seem mean 50/50 chance organ damage 
forget americans live paycheck paycheck employer go get decide people take risk debt/homeless/etc 
problem rely others follow simple mask wear 
many family economic future grandma life worth nobody want gran dead nobody want billy way kid sleep bridge real world complicate either view propose balance 
get picture first 
also know long antibody last could like common cold another coronavirus reinfected multiple time year 
grandma go get anyway something infectious unless put grandma bubble next two year absolutely one visit sure grandma want either sorry reality good news find lot less lethal initially think cdc current best estimate total infection fatality 0.4 still high seasonal flu ballpark lot low 3 4 initially think 
well people complete task simple wear mask able handle get real bad 
decision go interact public choice choose bearing choose 
get people simple task wear mask sure able complex measure really hit hard 
high gon na survive young healthy u definitely might make 
wow actually agree 
business stage 3 sound like good deal 
oxford university researcher mds believe reasonably low-cost steroid dexamethasone effective treatment covid19 symptom cause sars-2 study well-publicized yet remain peer review ideally independent research patient result back oxford favorable initial report 
fear economic fall interest topic worth analyze question whether fall actually cause virus failure mitigate provide proper social safety people wealthy elite even upper middle class would like convince everyone go back work order prevent economic collapse easy say continue work comfortably home watch stock portfolio remain tact desperate anxiety-ridden mass go back work get sick order achieve herd immunity applaud essential worker hero take hit keep economy hum along choice false choice country enough capacity capability provide basic necessity everyone without inflict death half million people likely head second wave simply lack political restructure economic system redirect resource need 
impact family friends neighbor co-worker etc appear influence news report tragically people age background etc location object simply refuse believe sars-2 virus covid19 disease real hit closer home 
source 50/50 organ damage seem right 
get varies person person like see stats 50 chance organ damage bc seem hyperbolic even symptomatic case virus cause long term complication vast majority people 60 nation death sentence shitty thing come take precaution protect vulnerable family live paralyze fear 
rely others follow simple mask wear seem talk since one say tire try stop 
well could listen expert implement full scale test trace procedure moron chief merry band idiot decide hard unlike every advanced nation seem gotten handle situation leave people sick tire wait reopen real plan address real danger pose covid 
argue kid useless although young people 1/10,000,000 chance die still want act die someone cough build need look demographic die medium hide u reason give purpose life 
friend calm nerve harm worry actual virus take precaution smart survive promise 
could fluke even break clock right twice day _ ツ _ 
assume tl dr first in-depth dedicate immunologic profile people covid-19 never develop symptom less immunologic inflammatory response prolong viral shed 59 w abnormal lung ct scan 
busy day able find exact source u study back time look researcher find people mild disease abnormal lab image finding even never progress severe disease accord edward study 47 people mild disease 61 moderate disease abnormal liver function test indicate injury liver illness another small study find 50 people symptom abnormal finding image test show damage lung even without lung symptom

continue ensure wo get sick fair u address slight thanks pep talk read comment one respond simply say incorrect say everyone survive everyone fine obviously true say single thing keep thing shutdown expect anything say ca continue ensure wo get sick would say mother sister go fuck 
nc flatten curve peak always predict june/july may later reopen thing 
downvote look reddit show vary point low up/downvoted post since accuse read source actual study paper mention permanent long term effect seem possible correlation nothing scientifically study paper think permanent damage alarm really hope end common 
still thing need ramp test trace need building infrastructure manufacture deploy vaccine ready trial do instead people put plan together completely abdicate responsibility fuck tragic thousand go die need whole choice economy human life could prevent every expert scream need test need wear mask ignore politically inconvenient admit problem 
go back dead body way solve economic issue 
thing open would make peak occur sooner later 
look actual source type damage similar virus long term know actually go study 
study see mention scientist academic possible seeing
